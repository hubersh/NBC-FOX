(Rob Ostermaier / Daily Press file photo)', 'The latest annual report on the health of the Chesapeake Bay continues to show areas of improvement and decline — and for the first time it tracks the impacts of climate change on the nation’s biggest estuary.', 'The science-based Bay Barometer released Tuesday by the Chesapeake Bay Program shows progress in 2017-18 in several areas — an abundance of underwater grasses, more streams opened to fish passage, good progress in oyster reef restoration, record overall water quality and more lands protected from development.', 'But it also shows that toxic contaminants are not only widespread but on the rise, that waters are warming and impacting fish species, that forest buffer plantings fell woefully short and that agricultural and urban polluted runoff remain big hurdles in bay cleanup.', 'Ben Grumbles, chairman of the CBP Principals’ Staff Committee, said it’s become “more important than ever to measure our progress” in the era of climate change.', '“Chesapeake Bay Program partners are embracing science, pollution prevention and community resilience as the climate impacts of warmer, wetter, wilder weather intensify,” Grumbles said.', 'The barometer is intended to track the condition of the watershed under a 2014 agreement by federal and state governments to achieve certain restoration goals for fisheries and habitats, water quality, land conservation, public access and stewardship and, now, climate resiliency.', 'Well over half of the Chesapeake Bay still is polluted, but experts say water quality has improved significantly — and, in fact, is now the best they’ve ever measured.', 'New preliminary data from the Chesapeake Bay Program indicates that about 42 percent of the bay and its tidal tributaries met clean...', 'Each report offers an annual snapshot of a moment in time, but also pulls in long-term data that, in some cases, stretches back decades.', 'Under the new climate change section, for instance, the report looks at changes in average air temperature from 1901-2017, stream temperature from 1960 to 2014 and relative sea level rise from 1960 to 2017.', 'In those time-frames, Hampton Roads has seen a 1-2 degree F increase in average air temperature, an average 2.1 degree hike in stream temperature and a 10.37-inch increase in relative sea level — by far the biggest rise in the bay.', 'Warming temperatures lead to increased flooding throughout the watershed’s 64,000 square miles, as well as negative impacts on fish species like brook trout that rely on cold, clean water, said Jennifer Dopkowski, acting coordinator of NOAA’s Climate Resiliency Workgroup.', '“The positive news,” Dopkowski said, “is that these indicators are helping us to better understand how a changing climate impacts our entire watershed and how these shifting conditions can inform our ability to restore and protect the waters in our backyard and in the bay.”', 'Last week, the CBP released preliminary data showing that bay water quality is the best since monitoring began in 1985, with 42 percent of the bay and its tidal tributaries meeting clean water standards from 2015 to 2017.', 'Beth McGee, director of science and agricultural policy at the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called such improvement fresh evidence of the bay’s resilience and the success of pollution reduction actions taken by state and local governments.', 'But, she said Tuesday, “with 58 percent of the bay’s waters still designated as impaired, there is still a long way to go.”', 'Toxic contaminants — industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, metals, PCBs, etc. — continue to plague the bay, with nearly 83 percent of its tidal segments partially or fully impaired.', 'That’s up from 72.2 percent contamination in 2010.', "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", 'Total lunar eclipse will take place Sunday night, January 20th, 2019.', 'Jefferson Lab physicist Latifa Elouadrhiri is pictured in Hall B with the Large Acceptance Spectrometer Thursday January 17, 2019. Elouadrhiri will be part of the Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics this weekend supporting undergraduate women in physics sponsored by William &amp; Mary and Jefferson Lab.', 'William &amp; Mary Professor Myriam Cotten is studying the medical possibilities of a biomolecule found in the stripped bass using magnetic resonance device (background) that is similar to a medical MRI machine.

But the actual amount planted was only 56 miles — the lowest total in 22 years.', 'Planting efforts continue to be hindered, McGee said, because a key funding source for forest buffers — the USDA’s Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program — closed in September 2018 and isn’t expected to open again until the fall.', 'According to the report, blue crab numbers failed to hit targets, but are holding steady, while oyster reef rebuilding is underway in eight of 10 tributaries chosen for restoration work.', 'Meanwhile, efforts to restore historical fish migration routes have topped expectations, with 1,236 miles opened between 2012 and 2017, surpassing the 1,000-mile goal.', 'Among the bay’s continuing success stories is submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), as abundance has hit record levels for the last three years. Underwater grasses are considered bellwethers for bay health.', 'Preliminary data from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science estimates there were nearly 105,000 acres of grass beds in the bay in 2017 — nearly 15,000 acres above the 2017 target and 57 percent of the overall 185,000-acre goal.', 'Experts are analyzing 2018 data now for next year’s report, and already are cautious because of the possible impacts from last year’s record rainfall throughout the estuary. Increased rainfall typically dumps even more pollutants and sediments into the watershed.', '“We want to manage expectations a bit, “ said Peter Tango, coordinator of a scientific work group with the U.S. Geological Survey. “Past experience from living through these wet years, like 2003, 2004 and 2011 around the bay, suggests we’re likely to see a decline in the indicator score.”', '“Underwater grasses are susceptible to extreme weather — especially when that weather affects water quality,” said Brooke Landry, head of the SAV Workgroup with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. “But, for now, we are still celebrating that we achieved 57 percent of the restoration goal of 185,000 acres.”', 'To read the Bay Barometer 2017-2018, go to ', 'Senators from Maryland and West Virginia introduced legislation Thursday to match Virginia Rep.
