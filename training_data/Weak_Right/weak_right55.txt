(Rob Ostermaier / Daily Press)', 'Christopher Newport University got the official go-ahead to freeze tuition next year in a special meeting of its board of visitors on Friday.', 'The board’s executive committee voted unanimously to approve the proposal, which would keep tuition the same for all undergraduate students next academic year. Other mandatory fees will rise about 3 percent, for an overall annual tuition and fees increase of about 1.1 percent.', 'In-state undergraduate students will pay $14,924 in tuition and fees for the 2019-20 academic year; out-of state students will pay $27,790. Room and board will be set at a board meeting later in the year.', 'CNU president Paul Trible said this will be the first academic year since 2002 that tuition hasn’t risen.', "“We're doing something significant today, and I'm so pleased that this time has come,” Trible said.", 'The decision to freeze tuition came after an amendment to the state’s budget bill setting aside more than $52 million for Virginia public colleges and universities that freezes tuition for in-state undergraduates made it through the General Assembly and was approved by the governor.', 'The bill sets aside nearly $1.7 million for CNU.', 'Schools across the state are working to meet the requirements for the funding.', 'Christopher Newport University officials said they will not seek an increase in tuition next academic year for all students, thanks to extra money from the state.', 'An amendment to this year’s state budget gives over $52 million to Virginia public colleges and universities that keep tuition for full-time,...', 'The College of William and Mary, Norfolk State University and Old Dominion University all are considering proposals to keep tuition the same for in-state students. Virginia Commonwealth University is considering a proposal like CNU’s to keep tuition the same for all students.', 'The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, the state’s higher education regulator, said in its tuition and fees report for the 2018-19 academic year that state funding plays a large role in setting tuition, and the state hasn’t been keeping up.', 'State law asks that the state give enough funding for schools to pay for at least two-thirds of the educational costs of resident students, although that hasn’t actually happened in years. In the 2001-02 academic year, the state funded about 77 percent of the cost of an in-state undergraduate student’s education.', 'In 2018-19, the state paid only 45 percent.', 'In addition to the $1.7 million in state funds set aside for tuition, the state is providing another roughly $1.1 million in new funds next fiscal year and almost $990,000 in additional financial aid. The university also anticipates another almost $500,000 in savings from other state programs.', '“They are providing substantially more funding in the next year for Christopher Newport than we previously expected, or that has been provided in the recent past,” said board of visitors rector Bobby Hatten.', 'Part of why the board held the special executive session, Trible said, was to make sure students who hadn’t decided where to go next year knew about the freeze and how it would impact the university’s guaranteed tuition plan.', 'Called the “Captains Commitment,” the plan sets tuition and fees in advance of when a student first enrolls so that they and their families know what they’ll pay over four years.', 'The board approved a plan on Friday essentially bumping back the plan a year. Students entering in the fall will pay about 5.5 percent more to $15,744 for their second year, followed by 1 percent increases the next two years to $16,066 for their senior year.', 'Trible estimated that this will save students entering in the fall over $1,300 over their four years. If funds are provided to be able to freeze tuition in the future, Trible said, the savings could go up.', '“We hope that we can send a special message to our friends in Richmond, one of profound appreciation of their leadership and new funding — and the hope that they will continue to do this in future years,” Trible said.', 'Dr. Mark Nataupsky created the Holocaust Teacher Resource Center website for educators from kindergarten to college.', 'Dr. Mark Nataupsky created the Holocaust Teacher Resource Center website for educators from kindergarten to college.', 'Dr. Mark Nataupsky created the Holocaust Teacher Resource Center website for educators from kindergarten to college.', 'Dr. Mark Nataupsky created the Holocaust Teacher Resource Center website for educators from kindergarten to college.', "Approximately 1,400 Hampton City Schools freshmen students gathered at the Hampton Coliseum during the division's second annual Commitment to Graduate Ceremony where students pledged to live up to the ideals of a Hampton graduate.\xa0", "Approximately 1,400 Hampton City Schools freshmen students gathered at the Hampton Coliseum during the division's second annual Commitment to Graduate Ceremony where students pledged to live up to the ideals of a Hampton graduate.\xa0", 'With the help of a donation from Smithfield Foods, Smithfield High now has a new careers training facility right next to the school.\xa0', 'With the help of a donation from Smithfield Foods, Smithfield High now has a new careers training facility right next to the school.\xa0', "Virginia Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry Bettina Ring paid a visit to Isle of Wight's student farm on Friday, March 1, 2019.", "Virginia Secretary of Agriculture and Forestry Bettina Ring paid a visit to Isle of Wight's student farm on Friday, March 1, 2019.", "Jill Biden, wife of former Vice President Joe Biden, speaks to the Apprentice School's class of 2018 at their graduation ceremony Saturday February 23, 2019 at Liberty Baptist Church.\xa0", "Jill Biden, wife of former Vice President Joe Biden, speaks to the Apprentice School's class of 2018 at their graduation ceremony Saturday February 23, 2019 at Liberty Baptist Church.\xa0", 'Pictures from Daily Press Photographer', 'Christopher Newport University got the official go-ahead to freeze tuition next year in a special meeting of its board of visitors on Friday.', 'The board’s executive committee voted unanimously to approve the proposal, which would keep tuition the same for all undergraduate students next academic...']
