Troy-based Kresge became the first private foundation to embrace the ABFE's Diversity in Foundation Asset Management Pledge.", 'Kresge President and CEO Rip Rapson said the oath was at least partially inspired by a moment of chagrin during an investment committee meeting when vice-president and CIO Robert Manilla brought his entire team into the room.', 'All 14 or 15 of them were white. Only one was a woman.', 'A trustee raised her hand, Rapson recounted, and said, "You know, Rob, I\'m sure these are talented and wonderful people. Don\'t take this personally.

President and CEO Susan Taylor Batten said Kresge had taken an important step to "not only look inward, but to serve as a model for other institutions that manage large endowments."', "Kresge cited studies that show equal or better performance by asset management firms operated by women and minorities. But according to a 2016 report from Bella Research Group and the Knight Foundation, the firms represent only 1.1% of the financial industry's $71 trillion in assets under management.", 'Rapson said he recently asked Manilla the obvious question: "If that can be demonstrated, why have people been so reluctant to invest with them?', 'There\'s a persistent narrative, Manilla responded, "that you do this at the expense of returns."', 'Joining ABFE\'s movement, Rapson said\xa0— and for now, leading it — "clearly signals to our peers in philanthropy that this is something one of the best performers in the industry is going to take on."', 'Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/04/05/kresge-abfe-rapson-assets-diversity/3379185002/']
