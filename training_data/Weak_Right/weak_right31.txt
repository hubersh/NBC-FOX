Northam says his new plan includes practices and policies to achieve those reductions.', 'Secretary of Natural Resources Matthew Strickler says the plan “prioritizes actions that are practical, cost-effective and provide multiple benefits to the commonwealth — whether that is flood control, coastal resilience, wildlife habitat or economic development.”', 'Virginia achieved much of its nutrient reduction by upgrading wastewater treatment plants, but other sources of overloads — urban and suburban runoff, agriculture and septic tanks — are increasing as the population grows.', 'More than 18 million people now live in the Chesapeake watershed, which stretches over portions of Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia.', 'To read the Phase III WIP, learn how to submit comments and register for a webinar for a plan overview, go to ', "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", "This Day in History: Challenger Disaster January 28, 1986 Seventy-three seconds after its 11:38 a.m. launch, NASA's space shuttle exploded, killing all seven crew members.\xa0", 'Total lunar eclipse will take place Sunday night, January 20th, 2019.', 'Jefferson Lab physicist Latifa Elouadrhiri is pictured in Hall B with the Large Acceptance Spectrometer Thursday January 17, 2019.
