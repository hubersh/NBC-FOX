As a result, two of the three plaintiffs “timely filed their claims within six months following the deprivation of their property.”', 'The high court ordered the case back to the Michigan Court of Appeals, directing judges there to consider a separate argument by the state, which has acknowledged computer errors and changed unemployment insurance policies and protocols in recent years.', '“We’re alive,” said Jennifer Lord, lead attorney in a case seeking class-certification for any claimants falsely accused of\xa0fraud under former Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration.', '“We’ve got a completely different government structure now, and so I think this is a major tide,” she said, noting that new Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Attorney General Dana Nessel could take a different approach in the case.', '“The governor and the attorney general I think will think long and hard about whether or not they want to keep fighting this,” Lord said. “Because there are lots and lots of people out there, the majority of people, who still have never been fully compensated.”', 'The Unemployment Insurance Agency is “reviewing the decision” handed down by the Supreme Court,\xa0spokesman Chris DeWitt said Friday.', 'Likewise, the attorney general\'s office is "reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision and will work in tandem with our client to determine the most appropriate course of action moving forward," said Nessel spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney.', 'The agency announced in August 2017 that it was refunding falsely accused claimants more than $20.8 million. As of last fall, the state had processed almost all of the refunds, but plaintiffs contend monetary damages extended beyond the refunds paid by the state.', 'Whitmer and Nessel in February put out a public call for help to reach roughly 500 residents who were still owed refunds but had not claimed them.', 'Chief Justice Bridget McCormack concurred with the unanimous decision but wrote a separate opinion that questioned the blanket law requiring plaintiffs seeking monetary damages against the state to sue within six months. \xa0', '“Is the six-month, no-exceptions notice provision reasonable when the government has taken a person’s property without due process?” she asked.', 'Justice Megan Cavanagh, who took the bench this year after getting elected\xa0last fall, did not participate in the decision because it was argued before she assumed office.', 'Friday’s ruling does not send the case back to the Michigan Court of Claims for possible class certification. Instead, justices are asking the state\xa0Court of Appeals to consider the state’s argument it is entitled to dismissal on the grounds that “plaintiffs failed to raise cognizable constitutional tort claims.”', 'That issue,\xa0Lord said, boils down to whether individuals have a right to sue the state for monetary damages for violating a constitutional right in the absence of a law that provides a clear remedy.', 'The courts have “danced around the issue” for years, she said, and the false fraud lawsuit could provide justices with an opportunity to define what an “appropriate case” looks like.', 'Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/04/05/supreme-court-revives-false-fraud-lawsuit-against-michigan/3377047002/']
