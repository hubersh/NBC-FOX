Meeting with the employees as we did and talking with them face-to-face was very important to do,” said Dever, who has been president since 2011. “They are valued members of our community. Faculty and staff will tell you that they’ve developed good relationships, as well as students, over the years with them.', 'Some people enroll at Thomas Nelson Community College for a certificate to foster a career switch.', 'Others – more than 5,500 last year – work toward a two-year transferable degree, intent on completing a bachelor’s degree at a four-year university.', 'Several thousand more take non-credit classes in...', '“But when we looked at the numbers, the cost that we had per square foot here at Hampton as opposed to the Historic Triangle campus, and when we looked at sister institutions who contracted out … here at Hampton where we were doing it ourselves was much higher per square foot. Once we saw that and saw the issues that we’re dealing with in terms of our budget we had to make that decision based upon the cost savings that we could realize. But it was, again, in regards to dealing with people, in my time here it’s been my most difficult decision, but it’s one we had to make.”', 'Enrollment hit its all-time peak in 2011-12 with 16,404 students, the equivalent of 7,234 full-time students.

Enrollment boomed by 30 percent during the recession.', 'So has been the case at community colleges across the state, especially those in metropolitan areas, Dever said. When the economy is up and unemployment low, enrollment is down, with fewer people seeking career changes or further certifications to find employment.', 'All but two of the state’s 23 community colleges — Lord Fairfax in Middleton, Luray and Warrenton, and John Tyler in Chester and Midlothian — saw enrollment declines between 2016-17 and 2017-18, according to data from the Virginia Community College System. More than half of all colleges have lost students since 2011-12.', 'At TNCC, this year’s $42.8 million budget is based on an estimated average of 4,899 full-time equivalent students. Dever wrote in an email to faculty and staff on Feb. 22 that they expected to meet or slightly exceed that target.', 'Despite that, Dever wrote that for the rest of the fiscal year there would need to be “mid-year belt tightening,” without which the college could end the year with a deficit.', 'John Clark / Daily Pres', 'Thomas Nelson Community College celebrates its 50th Anniversary October 4th, 2018.

Four were filled at the time.', 'It’s too soon to say if there might be other changes or cuts as next year’s budget is still being finalized.', '“I’m not saying I anticipate any, but I can’t say that I can take it off the table because we have to see where we’re going to be next year in that regard,” Dever said. “These are the most difficult things to do, the first reduction in force that we had but particularly the second one with the great number of employees affected.”', 'TNCC currently contracts housekeeping to A and B Cleaning at its Historic Triangle Campus and Peninsula Workforce Development Center, housed in a building near its Hampton campus.', 'Robert Auerbach just wants to make you laugh.', 'He’ll work so hard that it’s bound to happen to you somewhere on the second floor of Hastings Hall on Thomas Nelson Community College’s Hampton campus.', 'Sometimes you have to duck into a doorway to avoid catching his eye and arriving late to a class,...', 'The college has offered its current 20 employees, 18 full-time and two part-time, one-on-one sessions with human resources to discuss options.
