Police then were called on reports of shots fired between a Ford Fusion and a Dodge Durango.", '"We were able to -- with almost no injuries --\xa0end all of this, get everybody into custody and charge appropriately," Sterling Heights Police Chief Dale Dwojakowski said at Friday\'s press conference. He expressed gratitude that it happened during spring break week "because\xa0this pursuit through Sterling Heights ... went through several school zones."', '(Photo: Sterling Heights Police Department)', 'The alleged driver of the Durango, Brandon Dalen Hubert, 27, of Detroit,\xa0was  arrested Thursday evening.

The Durango pulled over to a side street, which allowed officers to pursue the Fusion. While cops attempted to stop the Fusion, Lattner allegedly got out and ran.
