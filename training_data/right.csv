"White House cancels Major League Baseball's Cuba deal | Fox NewWhite House cancels Major League Baseball's Cuba deaTrump administration to tighten rules for baseball players from CubU.S. reportedly trying to make sure money paid to Cuban players doesn't go to Cuban government; FBN's Blake Burman has the details.The Trump administration is moving to end anagreement allowing Cuban baseball playerto sign contracts directly withclubs a change that requires Cuban players to once again cut ties with the Communist nation before signing a major league deal.Last year 25 Cuban-born players played in at least one major league baseball game.The Treasury Department&amp;apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control told MLB attorneys in a letter Friday that it was reversing an Obama administration rule allowing the major leagues to pay the Cuban Baseball Federation a release fee equal to 25 percent of each Cuban player&amp;apos;s signing bonus. The payment mechanism was similar to agreements MLB has with leagues in China South Korea and Japan.In exchange the Cuban federation had agreed to release all players aged 25 and older with at least six years of professional experience.Rubio: I won't diplomatically recognize Cuba as presiden2016 GOP candidate says he would reverse 'one-sided deal' and strip embassy titlIn the letter which was made public Monday afternoon the Treasury Department told MLB that the payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation constituted illegal business with the Cuban government. That reverses a ruling made by the Obama administration allowing the payments.U.S. law prohibits virtually all payments to the Cuban government under the 60-year embargo on the island but MLB argued the Cuban Baseball Federation which oversees all aspects of the sport on the island was not formally a part of the Cuban state.Opponents called that argument ridiculous given the tight control the highly regimented government maintains over virtually every aspect of life in Cuba.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS AP""The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society"" National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement. ""The Administration looks forward to working with MLB to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents and not as property of the Cuban State.""""We stand by the goal of the agreement which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba"" an MLB statement said.Without a formal path from Cuba to the major leagues hundreds of top players have left the island for good many making harrowing crossings on rafts and rickety boats in the years before Cuba abandoned a hated exit permit requirement for most of its citizens.White House targets Cuba Venezuela and NicaraguNational Security Adviser John Bolton brands the countries a 'troika of tyranny' while announcing new sanctions over human rights violations and political oppression.While such dangerous escapes were mostly eliminated with greater travel freedoms players still needed to cut ties with Cuban baseball and often their families and hometowns going years without returning after signing with the major leagues.""The deal with Major League Baseball is an attempt to stop human trafficking encourage cooperation and elevate the level of baseball"" the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter. ""The politically motivated attacks on the deal hurt players their families and fans.""Last week the Cuban federation released a list of 34 players eligible to sign contracts with major league clubs. The players were aged between 17 and 25 years classified as international amateurs under MLB rules and eligible to sign minor league contracts. No likely stars were apparent on the list but more notable players included 22-year-old Raidel Martinez Perez and 23-year-old LivÃ¡n Moinelo Pita who have played professionally in Japan; 17-year-old infielder Loidel ChapellÃ_ Zulueta; and 18-year-old pitcher Norge Carlos Vera Aldana.Fox News&amp;apos; John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignâ€™ with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

New York Democrats launch fresh bid to dig up Trumpâ€™s tax returns | Fox NewNew York Democrats launch fresh bid to dig up Trumpâ€™s tax returnTrump 2020 campaign: Voters want the president's agenda not his tax returnNew York state Democrats launched a new effort Monday to pave the way for the release ofstate tax returns â€“ a move New Yorkâ€™s GOP chairman called â€œludicrousâ€ù â€œpartisanâ€ù and illegal.Under New York tax law it is illegal to share someoneâ€™sDEMS RAMP UP ANTI-TRUMP PROBEBut on Monday state Sen. Brad Hoylman introduced S5072 which would amend the law and require the commissioner of taxation and finance â€œto cooperate with investigations by certain committees of the United States Congress under certain circumstancesâ€ù â€“ a bid to let the state share tax return information specifically Trumpâ€™s with congressional committees that request it.â€œThis new bill will permit New York State to comply with requests from congressional investigative committees and help ensure Congress canâ€™t be blocked in their attempts to hold even the highest elected officials in the land accountable to the American peopleâ€ù Hoylman said in a statement.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. said in a statement that the bill could help Congress get tax returns if blocked at the federal level â€“ an apparent reference to an effort by another House committee to get six years of Trumpâ€™s returns directly from the IRS.â€œThis legislation would make the work of a federal committee a little easier if confronted with inability to receive the federal tax return we can turn to New York Stateâ€ù Nadler said.Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said onthat Democrats will â€œneverâ€ù see the presidentâ€™s tax returns â€œnor should they.â€ùMULVANEY VOWS DEMS WILL NEVER SEE TRUMP TAX RETURNEd Cox the chairman of the New York State Republican Party called the latest legislation from New York Democrats â€œludicrous.â€ùâ€œThis is so political so aimed at Donald Trump no matter how they disguise it otherwiseâ€ù said Cox who predicted the issue will go all the way to the Supreme Court. â€œI suspect it will be ruled to violate equal protection laws and be deemed a bill of attainder.â€ùA bill of attainder is an unconstitutional legislative act that singles out an individual or group for punishment without a trial. Cox argues the Democratic majority and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are trying to change the law for political gain.â€œThey are trying to re-litigate the 2016 election. Itâ€™s called Trump Derangement Syndrome and in the process they arenâ€™t doing the business of the people of New York state. Instead they are playing politics including the governor who is running hard to be presidentâ€ù Cox said.â€œTransparency and disclosure is vital but tax return privacy is also important and we should not politicize the process -- however Governor Cuomo believes elected officials on all levels should be prepared to release their taxes if they enter public service and he would include state and local as well as federal officials in any legal revisionâ€ùÂ saidÂ Rich Azzopardi a senior adviser to Cuomo.The governor has said he will not make a 2020 presidential run and has said former Vice President Joe Biden has the â€œbest caseâ€ù among the Democratic contenders. But in a profile in The Atlantic Cuomo suggested that â€œifâ€ù Biden chooses not to run he could throw his hat in the ring.The push for S5072 follows the January introduction of a bill by New York Assemblyman David Buchwald that requires the disclosure of tax returns by statewide elected officials including the president.On the steps of the state capitol in Albany Buchwald and Hoylman touted that legislation the New York Truth Act as critical.â€œWhy is it important that we have access to the presidentâ€™s tax returns? It is because those tax returns reveal conflicts and potential conflicts of interest. They show whether the president has been in full compliance with our tax laws and they also show what the implications are to him of proposals he makes to amend the tax laws in this countryâ€ù Buchwald a former tax attorney said at the press conference.While similar efforts have failed in the past state Democrats suggest this yearâ€™s could gain traction. Buchwald said 93 Assembly members and a majority 32 state senators support the Truth Act.â€œThere is a copy of President Trumpâ€™s tax returns right here in New York state in an office somewhere and the only thing that prevents that state income tax return from being made public is a state statute that we in the state legislature should have the power to amendâ€ù Buchwald said.Trump has shown little interest in turning over the documents as the White House braces for a fight.â€œWeâ€™re under audit despite what people said and weâ€™re working that outâ€”Iâ€™m always under audit it seems and Iâ€™ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big. ... But until such time as Iâ€™m not under audit I would not be inclined to do thatâ€ùÂ Trump told reporters last week.Bryan Llenas currently serves as a National Correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC) based in New York.Click here for more information on Bryan Llena.

Cory Booker introduces Senate bill on slavery reparations | Fox NewCory Booker introduces Senate bill on slavery reparationDemocratic Presidential Candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ): What to knoWhat to know about Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) the issues he's advocating and some past statements he'll have to overcome.on Monday introduced a bill that would study the possibility of reparations for descendants of slaves embracing a push that recently has caught theinterest of fellow 2020Â Democratic presidential candidateThe senator from New Jersey said Monday that â€œthis bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism white supremacy and implicit racial bias in our country. It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed.â€ù2020 DEMOCRATS PLEDGE REPARATIONS SUPPORT AT SHARPTON CONFERENCThe measure is a Senate companion to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives in January by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas which if passed into law would set up a commission to study the impact of slavery and continued discrimination against black Americans and make recommendations on reparation proposals for the descendants of slaves. The legislation was first introduced 30 years ago by then-Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.â€œSince slavery in this country we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generationsâ€ù Booker added. â€œMany of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class have systematically excluded blacks through practices like GI Bill discrimination and redlining.â€ùBesides Booker the idea of slavery reparations for black AmericansÂ is at least partially backed by at least eight other Democratic presidential contenders. They are Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro who served as housing secretary under President Barack Obama; South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke of Texas; Rep.

In the immediate aftermath Harperâ€™s Country Hams of Clinton Kentucky was one of the first to step in offering to take over Edwardsâ€™ production until the company got back on its feet in their Surry Virginia home base. Almost exactly a year later the unthinkable happened again: Harperâ€™s plant caught fire too and both familiesâ€™ inventories were lost.Â Even in the face of that kind of devastation Edwards hasnâ€™t wavered in his determination to restore his historic operation to its former glory.â€ùFlag on the play? -with your tips comments or questions.Change from one week ago:Average includes: NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 41% approve - 55% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% approve - 50% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 55% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 51% disapprovBETO CALLS BIBI A RACISTon Sunday described Israeli Prime Ministeras a â€˜racistâ€™ whose outreach to far-right interests as he seeks to hang onto political power has seriously damaged the chances of peace in the Middle East. Speaking at a town hall here at the University of Iowa the former Texas congressman denounced Netanyahuâ€™s pledge Saturday that he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term in Tuesdayâ€™s Israeli general election. Netanyahuâ€™s proposed annexation Oâ€™Rourke said â€˜will make peace in the long term impossible.â€™ In response to a voterâ€™s question about his policy toward Israel and Palestinian rights Oâ€™Rourke reiterated his support for a two-state solution and accused Netanyahu of having â€˜joined forces with far-right parties who are inherently racist in their speech and the way that they want to treat their fellow human beings in that part of the world.â€™â€ùâ€œYet by the time he left the state on Sunday it was also clear that the euphoria that greeted [Beto] Rourkeâ€™s entry into the race three weeks earlier has started to subside. The inevitable slog of competing in a packed Democratic primary is underway and Oâ€™Rourke has not yet drawn the wave of national adulation from the left that his Senate run againstlast year received. â€˜Heâ€™s going to have to do the workâ€™ said an Iowa Democratic National Committee member and a former state party chairman. â€˜And it isnâ€™t all breathless 300-person crowds.â€™ â€_ Oâ€™Rourke has seen little movement in polls since he announced. â€_ And while Oâ€™Rourke sprinted from college campuses and coffee shops to house parties across Iowa a more established contender Bernie Sanders was drawing even larger audiences here.BUTTIGIEG SHARES THE STRUGGLE BEHIND HIS COMING OUTmay not become president or win the Democratic primary but he&amp;apos;s already broken a barrier by delving publicly and intimately into his struggle with his own sexuality in a way no other serious presidential candidate has. In a speech before an audience of LGBT rights supporters on Sunday the mayor of South Bend Indiana did not describe being gay as something he always believed was acceptable. Nor did he dismiss lingering questions about his viability as a presidential candidate in a country in which three in 10 adults still say they have some reservations or would be very uncomfortable with a gay candidate according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in February. Instead he described wrestling with his sexual orientation as â€˜a kind of warâ€™ â€” one he said he was only able to win when he came home from serving in Afghanistan.â€ùBERNIE WARMS TO THE FRONTRUNNER ROLEis quieting critics who questioned whether he could recapture the energy of his upstart 2016 campaign surpassing his rivals in early fundraising and establishing himself as an indisputable front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Less than two months into his second White House bid no other declared candidate in the crowded Democratic field currently has amassed so many advantages: a $28 million war chest a loyal and enthusiastic voter base and a set of clearly defined policy objectives.Â That puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns which he has not yet released.â€ùBernie wants felons to vote while still in prison -â€œSen. Bernie Sanders has long fought to restore voting rights for felons whoâ€™ve completed their prison sentences. Now the presidential candidate wants to go a big step further â€“ arguing that those currently behind bars should be able to vote too. Asked on the campaign trail in Muscatine Iowa on Saturday if those imprisoned should have the right to vote the independent senator from Vermont whoâ€™s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination answered: â€˜I think that is absolutely the direction we should go.â€™ â€˜In my state what we do is separate. Youâ€™re paying a price you committed a crime youâ€™re in jail. That&amp;apos;s badâ€™ Sanders explained. â€˜But youâ€™re still living in American society and you have a right to vote. I believe in that yes I do.â€™â€ùhas raised more than $5 million in the two months since he announced his 2020 plans the presidential candidateâ€™s campaign said Sunday. Bookerâ€™s haul while competitive puts him behind other Democratic White House aspirants including former Texas congressmanÂ Beto Oâ€™Rourke Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Sen.(Calif.) and South Bend Ind. MayorÂ Pete Buttigieg. Bookerâ€™s campaign said 82 percent of the donors gave to the senator for the first time and the average online contribution was $34. The New Jersey Democrat who was first elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election raised $17.7 million to win a full term one year later.â€ùBennet says nothing funny about Biden touchy contretemps -on Sunday criticized former Vice Presidentfor joking about the controversy swirling around his touchy avuncular style that some women say made them uncomfortable. â€˜I don&amp;apos;t think anyone should make jokes about itâ€™ the Colorado senator told CNN&amp;apos;son â€˜State of the Union.â€™ â€˜This is an important time in our country&amp;apos;s history when women are coming forward and able to say when they&amp;apos;ve been made to feel uncomfortable whether in a sexual way or a nonsexual way.

This was also a challenge to the people working for him at his United We Stand group which I assume includes your friend. They completed their work seven months later a pretty impressive clip especially at a time where ballot access was more restrictive and without the technology to organize that we have today. Unfortunately for them Perot had already spectacularly bizarrely dropped out of the race that summer before ever officially entering it. But when supporters delivered on the 50-state promise Perot belatedly jumped in and still ended up with nearly 20 percent of the vote. I think that if Schultz were to put in the hundreds of millions of dollars he has discussed and make a decision on his current timetable of sometime this summer I would think he would have ample time to make the ballot in all 50 states. Whether there would be enough people who cared about that in order to make it consequential is another matterâ€_Ed. note: But they do vote Mr. Steinen. That would be like asking only military members what they think of foreign policy or only women what the laws on abortion should be.

She did not take any questions from the media.The president announced Nielsenâ€™s would â€œbe leaving her positionâ€ù after 16 months on the job on Sunday evening. Nielsen took over leadership of the Department of Homeland Security after Trump appointed former DHS Secretary John Kelly to be White House chief of staff. Kelly has since resigned from that post.Trump also announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would replace Nielsen as acting secretary tweeting: â€œI have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!â€ùLater Nielsen tweeted that she had submitted her resignation.â€œIts[sic] been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov. I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service dedication and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazardsâ€ù she tweeted with an image of the resignation letter.The letter addressed to the president said: â€œDespite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside.â€ùShe later tweeted that she was â€œeternally grateful and proudâ€ù of the work of â€œthe brave and dedicated men and womenâ€ù of DHS.Nielsenâ€™s resignation came after a meeting with the president at the White House on Sunday amid an ongoing influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Associated Press reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help to deal with the growing number of families crossing the border.Administration officials told Fox News on Sunday that Nielsenâ€™s background in cybersecurity made her a poor fit to handle border issues while McAleenan best fits Trumpâ€™s requirement of being the â€œtoughest copâ€ù on the frontier.Sources told Fox News that Nielsen had been viewed as resistant to some of the immigration measures pushed by the president and his aides specifically related to protected status for some refugees and policies at the border.A senior administration official told Fox News that National Security Adviser John Bolton long felt that Nielsen was not the right person for the job and opposed her policy of using United Nations organizations to try to stem the flow of illegal migrants. The official added that Bolton and Kelly had a heated disagreement over Nielsenâ€™s approach during an October 2018 policy meeting after which Bolton went to Trump to protest what Nielsen was doing.KEVIN MCALEENAN NEW ACTING DHS BOSS HAS LONG RECORD IN BORDER SECURITOnce Kelly left the White House at the end of last year Nielsen&amp;apos;s days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November but her exit never materialized. And during the government shutdown over Trump&amp;apos;s push for funding for a border wall Nielsen&amp;apos;s stock inside the White House even appeared to rise.Trump nominated McAleenan as CBP commissioner on the first day of his presidency but McAleenan was not confirmed by the Senate until March of 2018. He wasÂ appointed CBP deputy commissioner in November 2014 by President Barack Obama.Sources tell Fox News that it remains to be seen whether McAleenan can handle the political duties required to be permanent homeland security secretary though they noted that he has excellent relationships with the Pentagon State Department and National Security Council. McAleenan also has a reputation within CBP as a ""brilliant"" mind with ""tremendous organizational skills.""Nielsen&amp;apos;s departure is the latest staffing shakeup in the department which was founded to combat terrorism after the Sept. 11 2001 terror attacks.On Friday Trump confirmed he had withdrawnÂ the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Ron VitielloÂ to become the permanent head of the agency telling reporters that ""Ronâ€™s a good man but weâ€™re going in a tougher direction we want to go in a tougher direction."" Administration sources tell Fox News that the withdrawal of Vitiello&amp;apos;s nomination was the first step in Trump&amp;apos;s plan to control the border crisis.The second step was asking for Nielsen&amp;apos;s resignation.Fox News&amp;apos; John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

"Appeals court upholds Ky. abortion law requiring ultrasounds | Fox NewAppeals court upholds Ky. abortion law requiring ultrasoundSenate rejects bill to protect infants who survive abortionOver the objections of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and an explosive dissent from an Obama-appointed judge aÂ federal appeals courtthe constitutionality of a Kentucky law requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and show fetal images to patients beforeÂ abortions.The case comes in the midst of aon abortion. Among the high points in that dialogue: a push by congressional Republicansto protect infants who survive abortion a radio interview in whichVirginia&amp;apos;s Democrat governor seemingly endorsed infanticidin some cases and the release of an anti-abortion drama calleby a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel was a majorÂ victory for Kentucky&amp;apos;s Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. The law was passed in 2017 when Republicans took control of the state&amp;apos;s legislature andÂ was quickly challenged by Kentucky&amp;apos;s sole remaining abortion clinic.The legislation specifically requiresÂ doctors to describe an ultrasound while the pregnant woman listens to the fetal heartbeat althoughÂ women canÂ avert their eyes and ask to have the sound turned off. written by Trump appointee Judge John Bush and joined by Reagan appointeeÂ Alan Eugene NorrisÂ said the Kentucky law did not stepÂ on doctors&amp;apos; First Amendment free speech rights.WHY DID SENATE DEMS BLOCK BILL TO ENSURE MEDICAL STANDARD OF CARE FOR INFANTS WHO SURVIVE ABORTIONS?Bush saidÂ the legislation complied with the Supreme Court&amp;apos;s seminal 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey which established that states can enact laws necessary to obtain women&amp;apos;s ""informed consent"" prior to an abortion -- as long as those laws don&amp;apos;t pose an ""undue burden"" on the abortion right.""Does [the law] relate to a medical procedure? Yes â€” abortion"" Bush wrote.Â ""Are the mandated disclosures truthful and not misleading? Yesâ€”no one argues that the heartbeat sonogram or its description is false or misleading. We have previously held that similar information conveys objective medical facts. ...Â That leaves the final question: Are the mandated disclosures relevant to the patientâ€™s decision whether to abort unborn life? The Supreme Courtâ€™s abortion precedent answers this question for us.""Bush specifically said that ultrasound images were ""relevant"" to the decision as toÂ whether to terminate what he explicitly called ""unborn life.""""The information conveyed by an ultrasound image its description and the audible beating fetal heart gives a patient greater knowledge of the unborn life inside her"" Bush said. ""This also inherently provides the patient with more knowledge about the effect of an abortion procedure: it shows her what or whom she is consenting to terminate. That this information might persuade a woman to change her mind does not render it suspect under the First Amendment. It just means that it is pertinent to her decision-making.""The Kentucky law had been enjoined in a lower court prompting Bevin to appeal. The ACLU which took on the suit on behalf of theÂ EMW Women&amp;apos;s Surgical Center argued that the Kentucky law was essentially identical to a law struck down by a separate circuit court in North Carolina 2014.'Unplanned' star responds to celebrity boycott threat over Georgia's heartbeat bilAlthough rulings by other circuit courts are not binding on counterpartÂ courts in the absence of a clear ruling by the Supreme Court they can provide persuasive arguments. Several other states have existing laws either requiring ultrasounds be performed or that the option for an ultrasoundÂ is clearly given. Obama-appoined Judge Bernice Donald charged that the law had ""no basis in the practice of medicine"" and under Supreme Court precedent should therefore be subjected to heightened scrutiny.Donald specifically objected to Bush&amp;apos;s use ofÂ Planned Parenthood v. Casey&amp;apos;s undue-burden framework to address the ACLU&amp;apos;s First Amendment arguments which involve a separate area of law. The Kentucky law regulates speech Donald said and should be assessed in those terms -- not as a barrier to abortion.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APBush&amp;apos;s majority opinion addressed Donald&amp;apos;s objections noting that ""although much of the analysis in Casey addressed the plaintiffsâ€™ undue-burden claim the joint opinionâ€™s First Amendment holding built upon its conclusion that the mandated informed consent disclosures in that case met the criteria of being truthful non-misleading and relevant.""Contrary to the dissent&amp;apos;s suggestion ""that we have &amp;apos;focused on the wrong provision of the Constitution&amp;apos;"" Bush wrote ""indeed we do address the relevant provision â€” the First Amendment.""The Kentucky case seemed destined for the Supreme Court. In FebruaryChief JusticeÂ John RobertsÂ joined the Supreme Court&amp;apos;s liberal wing in temporarily blocking aÂ Louisiana lathat would have placed other restrictions on abortion clinics in the high court&amp;apos;s first major ruling on abortion since the confirmation of Associate JusticeÂ Brett Kavanaugh.The ruling cameÂ as Roberts who was appointed by President George W. BushÂ hasincreasingly and deliberately sought to present the federal judiciary as nonpartisa amid a flurry of attacks from progressive groups arguing that the Supreme Court&amp;apos;s new conservative majority imperils the country.

I would not expect it in the United States of America.""Later Thursday O&amp;apos;Rourke defended his comments when asked by reporters if he was comparing the Trump administration to Nazi Germany:Â ""Calling human beings an infestation is something that we might&amp;apos;ve expected to hear in Nazi Germany. ... Describing immigrants -- who have a track record of committing violent crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans -- as rapists and criminals. Seeking to ban all Muslims -- all people of one religion -- what other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing?""He continued: ""Putting kids in cages? Saying that neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists are &amp;apos;very fine people&amp;apos;? ... [T]his is not something that I expected to hear a president of the United States ever say.""O&amp;apos;Rourke covered a lot of ground in the comments referencing family separations at the border as well as the so-called travel ban and Trump&amp;apos;s controversial comments after the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville -- criticism at least rooted in Trump policies and remarks.But his claim that Trump referred broadly to immigrants as an ""infestation"" took the president&amp;apos;s words significantly out of context. In the original comments -- a tweet -- Trump used the word ""infestation"" in reference to MS-13 gangs.â€œWhen we have an â€˜infestationâ€™ of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws in our country.

These arenâ€™t people these are and weâ€™re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate thatâ€™s never happened beforeâ€ù Trump said last May.Democrats including now-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. criticized the president for his rhetoric at the time.

Last month campaigning in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire he charged that â€œwe have a prime minister in Israel who has openly sided with racists.â€ùAt the time Oâ€™Rourke also jabbed at Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.â€œOn the Palestinian side we have an ineffectual leader.

In the weeks leading up to the Israeli contest Trump hosted Netanyahu at the White House and signed a proclamation recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel overturning longstanding U.S. policy.The two moves appeared to give Netanyahu a foreign policy boost in the closing weeks before the election.Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignâ€™ with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

I believe in that yes I do.â€ùSANDERS UNLOADS ON TRUMP AT SHARPTON CONFERENCEVermont and Maine are the only states to allow felons currently serving their sentences to vote.The issue of voting rights for felonis in the spotlight in Iowa the state that votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar. The Hawkeye state and Kentucky are the only two in the nation to permanently disenfranchise everyone with felony convictions from voting.Iowa GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds is pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow convicts to have their voting rights restored after theyâ€™ve served their sentences. But last week the Republican-controlled state-Senate torpedoed the plan likely killing it for the year.Sanders took to Twitter at the time to write â€œthis is a disappointing setback for voting rights in Iowa.â€ùVoting rights in 36 states and the District of Columbia are restored to felons after theyâ€™ve completed the sentences with the laws varying to factor in parole and probation.Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was asked about the issue a week ago as the Massachusetts Democrat was campaigning in Iowa. She called for felons whoâ€™ve served their time to have the right to vote. But she stopped short of advocating that those actually in prison be able to vote.""While theyâ€™re incarceratedÂ I think thatâ€™s something we can have more conversation about"" she said.FLORIDA PASSES RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS FOR FELONLast November voters in Florida approved a constitutional amendment restoring the right to vote for the 1.4 million felons whoâ€™ve finished serving their sentences. Florida was the most populous of 10 states that permanently disenfranchised some people with criminal convictions.Last April Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York signed an executive order restoring voting rights for felons on parole. And in 2016 Virginiaâ€™s governor at the time Democrat Terry McAuliffe took executive action to restore voting rights to former felons.Opponents of allowing those in prison to vote argue that if youâ€™re not willing to follow the law then you should not have a role in making law for everyone either directly by voting on referendums and ballot initiatives or indirectly by electing lawmakers.They point out that that the whole point of incarceration is to separate felons from society.The Republican National Committee said Democratic attempts to expand the pool of voters friendly to their party is behind the push to allow felons serving time to vote.â€œFrom suggesting that illegal immigrants should be able to vote to trying to lower the voting age to 16 to now proposing convicted felons behind bars should be able to vote Democrats are once again trying to rewrite the rules for their own political agenda.

The move alsoÂ allows the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with material support or prosecute them for sanctions violations.In a statement Trump said the unprecedented move â€œunderscores the fact that Iranâ€™s actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments.â€ùHe warned: â€œIf you are doing business with the IRGC you will be bankrolling terrorism.Â This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences.â€ùPOMPEO VOWS TO PILE ECONOMIC POLITICAL PRESSURE ON IRAAdministration officials have said the step will further isolate Iran and make clear that the U.S. won&amp;apos;t tolerate Iran&amp;apos;s continued support for rebel groups and others that destabilize the Middle East.""The IRGC&amp;apos;s active support for terrorism is unacceptable and the Department of Justice continues to support the administration&amp;apos;s efforts to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its actions"" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.The designation howeverÂ may also have widespread implications for American personnel and policy in the region and elsewhere as Iran has threatened to retaliate.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APIt will also complicate diplomacy. Without exclusions or waivers to the designation U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move does not allow contact with foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel. Those concerns have in part dissuaded previous administrations from taking the step which has been considered for more than a decade.The move as expected also wasÂ panned by Iranian officials who called it a gift to Israel.""A(nother) misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu""Â Mohammad Javad Zarif the Iranian foreign minister tweeted on Monday.Â ""A(nother) dangerous U.S. misadventure in the region.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignâ€™ with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

"Dems ramp up anti-Trump probes post-Mueller despite pledge to focus on agenda | Fox NewDems ramp up anti-Trump probes post-Mueller despite pledge to focus on agendWhat's next for Congress after the release of the Mueller probe?Rep. Jim Jordan and Rep. Mark Meadows react to Democrats demanding a full release of the Mueller report and testimony from Attorney General Barr.Days after the summary of Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™srocked Washington House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats should shift focus to their legislative agenda.But while some in the caucus have indeed pivoted to issues like health care senior Democratic lawmakers have sought to keep the investigations humming ramping upon a variety of fronts while mounting a battle with the Justice Department over access to the complete Mueller report and its underlying materials.HOUSE DEM ASKS IRS FOR 6 YEARS OF TRUMP&amp;apos;S TAX RETURNS SETTING UP SHOWDOWN WITH WHITE HOUSLast week the House Judiciary Committee voted to authorize subpoenas for five former Trump advisers intensifying the committeeâ€™s sweeping probe into Trump and his personal business and political dealings. This came as the committee voted along party linesÂ to authorize subpoenas for the full Mueller report.Â Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. already has sent document requests toconnected to the president as part of his probe into â€œalleged obstruction of justice public corruption and other abuses of power by President Trump.â€ùMeanwhile the House Ways and Means Committee asked the Internal Revenue Service for six years of the presidentâ€™s personal and business tax returns. Committee Chairman Richard Neal D-Mass. formally requested the returnsâ€”marking the first request in 45 years for such documents related to a sitting president. The move is sure to set up a legal showdown between congressional Democrats and the White House.â€œItâ€™s critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officialsâ€ù Neal said in a statement. â€œTo maintain trust in our democracy the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly as laws intend.â€ùNealâ€™s request for Trump tax returns for 2013 through 2018 went directly to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.Acting White House Chief of StaffMickÂ Mulvaney speaking on ""Fox News Sunday""countered that Democrats will ""never"" see the documents.In a separate request related to Trumpâ€™s finances the House Oversight Committee authorized a series of subpoenas for Trumpâ€™s accounting firm Mazars Accounting. Chairman Elijah Cummings D-Md.that the firm would respond to the committeeâ€™s request for financial documents and audits prepared for Trump and his businesses over the last decade.Cummingsâ€™ committee since the release of the Mueller report has also formally voted to authorize and issue subpoenas for information related to both White House security clearances and the Trump administrationâ€™s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.The committee voted last week to subpoena White House personnel security director Carl Kline over a series of controversial security clearances. As for the census committee Democrats said they wanted specific documents that would determine why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided to add the question.And on the other side of Capitol Hill Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined Rep. Stephen Lynch both from Massachusetts to request an investigation into whether the White House is interfering with or overruling Secret Service recommendations about which guests at Trumpâ€™s Palm Beach property Mar-a-Lago should have access to the president.Warren and Lynch penned a letter to the acting inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security requesting the probe citing a series of reports that suggested the resort could be a channel for foreign adversaries to seek influence in federal policy and national security -- after a woman was arrested at the club allegedlycarrying two Chinese passports and malwarAll of these developments have come since March 24 when Attorney General Bill Barr released his summary of the Mueller reportÂ stating the special counsel found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 presidential election.A day after that momentous transmission Pelosi D-Calif. called for renewed focus on a legislative agenda.â€œThis is really important today. Because we must with all that is going on stay focused on our purposeâ€ùPelosi said the party needed to focus on â€œlower health care costs bigger paychecks and cleaner government.â€ùHOUSE JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS AUTHORIZE SUBPOENAS FOR MUELLER REPORBut top Democrats leading prominent congressional committees have instead expanded their existing Trump-focused investigations with some moving in new directions.The push for Trump&amp;apos;s tax returns however was months in the making.Democrats since taking back the majority have had every intention of targeting Trumpâ€™s tax files. In January just days after reclaiming the majority Democrats rolled out a broad ethics reform package thatÂ specificallyÂ requires presidents to disclose at least 10 years of their tax returns to the public.The topic has been a contentious one since Trump&amp;apos;s time on the campaign trail in 2016 as he refused to abide by past practice of presidential candidates and release his returns.Trump when informed of Nealâ€™s request said he was still â€œnot inclinedâ€ù to turn over his tax documents.â€œWeâ€™re under audit despite what people said and weâ€™re working that outâ€”Iâ€™m always under audit it seems and Iâ€™ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name youâ€™re audited. But until such time as Iâ€™m not under audit I would not be inclined to do thatâ€ù Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last week.HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE VOTES TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS ON WH SECURITY CLEARANCES CENSUS QUESTIONMeanwhile other Trump-focused investigations on Capitol Hill are ongoing.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff D-Calif. is investigating the presidentâ€™s foreign business dealings and Russian election meddling maintaining that despite the results of Muellerâ€™s probe there is evidence of collusion.Schiffâ€™s panel has also weighed subpoenaing the interpreter who was present for meetings between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to obtain notes from the summits.TRUMP ACCUSES SCHIFF OF &amp;apos;UNLIMITED PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT&amp;apos; AMID NEW PROBThe House Financial Services Committee led by Rep. Maxine Waters D-Calif. is also probing the president coordinating with Schiffâ€™s committee on money-laundering inquiries. The House Foreign Affairs Committee chaired by Rep. Eliot Engel D-N.Y. is also involved.Schiff and Waters have together said they would run a joint investigation into Deutsche Bankâ€”which has done extensive business dealings with the president. Last year Schiff charged that Trumpâ€™s financial records with Deutsche Bank and Russia may reveal a â€œform of compromiseâ€ù that â€œneeds to be exposed.â€ù Schiff has long maintained that there had to be some reason that the German banking giant which he said has a â€œhistory of laundering Russian moneyâ€ù was willing to work with the Trump Organization.Trump for his part tried to pivot from investigations into himÂ and encourage Democrats to begin probes instead into the early stages of the Russia probeâ€”like the Senate Judiciary Committee has announcedâ€”and focus on legislation.â€œAccording to polling few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got startedâ€”so illegal!â€ù Trump tweeted Thursday.Earlier in the week Trump blasted both Schiff and Nadler specifically claiming Democrats would never be satisfied.â€œThere is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is not time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!â€ù Trump tweeted Tuesday.Last month the president accused Democrats of simply """" with their investigations into ""the same nonsense.""But despite Pelosiâ€™s calls for action she has said she has faith in her committee chairs and their investigations.After the State of the Union in Februaryâ€œItâ€™s our congressional responsibility and if we didnâ€™t do it we would be delinquent in that.â€ùFox News&amp;apos; Gregg Re and Andrew O&amp;apos;Reilly contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Bobby Rush (D-IL) slams Chicago's police union as 'the sworn enemy of black people' amid the controversy surrounding prosecutor Kim Foxx and her handling of the Jussie Smollett case.Illinois Democratic Rep. Bobby Rush blasted the Chicago police union over the weekend as â€œthe sworn enemy of black peopleâ€ù pushing back at the controversy surrounding prosecutor Kim Foxx and her office&amp;apos;s handling of the JussieDuring a press conference on Saturday Rush D-Ill. tore into Chicagoâ€™s Fraternal Order of Police after members of the union participated in protests demanding Cook County State&amp;apos;s AttorneyCHICAGO PROSECUTOR KIM FOXX DEFENDS JUSSIE SMOLLETT DECISIOâ€œThe FOP is the sworn enemy of black people the sworn enemy of black peopleâ€ù RushSaturday. â€œThe FOP has always taken the position that black people can be shot down in the street by members of the Chicago Police Department and suffer no consequences.â€ùHe added: â€œLetâ€™s be clear: Kim Foxx her battle is with the FOP and all of their cohorts.â€ùRushâ€™s comments came after hundreds of protesters including members of the police union gathered outside Foxxâ€™s office last week. The union protesters were met with counter-protests from groups including the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression according to TheThe Tribune also reported that members of white nationalist groups were at the unionâ€™s protest.â€œThe injection of white nationalists in this conversation for me I will tell you personally I was afraidâ€ù Foxx said on Saturday. â€œI would certainly hope that the FOP and whatever their disagreements may be whatever concerns that they may have about my ability or leadership would at least expect the people of their union to not inject racism or white nationalists into the conversation.â€ùThe union though told The Tribune Saturday that Rushâ€™s comments were â€œignorant offensive malicious and false.â€ùâ€œThese outrageous and irresponsible comments have demeaned each and every Chicago Police Officer regardless of their raceâ€ù the union reportedly said.JUSSIE SMOLLETT&amp;apos;S ALLEGED CHICAGO ATTACK DETAILS UNFOLD: A TIMELINE OF EVENTFoxx has come under fire over her officeâ€™s decision to dismiss charges against Smollett following accusations he faked a hate crime. Foxx now claims the â€œEmpireâ€ù star did not receive any special treatment.â€œI have been asking myself for the last two weeks what is this really aboutâ€ù Foxx said Saturday. â€œAs someone who has lived in this city who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role it is disheartening to meâ€_that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change.â€ùFoxx reportedly mentioned in her speech that sheÂ welcomes an independent investigation into her handling of the case saying that nearly 6000 other ""low-level defendants"" received the same treatment with deferred prosecution addingÂ that under the law Smollett could&amp;apos;ve been fined a maximum of $10000 â€” which he effectively paid when he forfeited his bond for the same amount.Foxx publicly recused herself from Smollett&amp;apos;s case after communicating with one of his relatives during the police investigation into whether or not he staged an alleged hate crime against himself. But her officeÂ later saidÂ she neverÂ formallyÂ recused herself. She has received widespread criticism -- not just from the police union -- for her handling of the case.In January SmollettÂ told policeÂ that two masked men attacked him put a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him as he was walking home from a Subway restaurant. The actor who is black and openly gay said the masked men beat him made racist and homophobicÂ comments and yelled ""This is MAGA country"" before fleeing the scene.However theÂ Chicago Police DepartmentÂ alleged that Smollett paid the two menÂ Abel and Ola OsundairoÂ byÂ check forÂ a ""phony attack"" in order to take ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career."" The brothers were allegedly caught on surveillance footage purchasing the rope used in the staged ""attack"" on Smollett.The FBI is investigating whether Smollett sent himself a threatening hate letter to the ""Empire"" set which couldÂ potentially land himÂ behind bars for a decadeÂ for mail fraud â€” a federal offense.Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal. His attorneysÂ previouslyÂ told Fox NewsÂ they&amp;apos;ve ""witnessed an organized law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.Â The presumption of innocence a bedrock in the search for justice was trampled upon at the expense of Mr. Smollett and notably on the eve of a Mayoral election. Mr. Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing.â€ùFox Newsâ€™ Jessica Sager and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

Michael Bennet on cancer diagnosis: 'I donâ€™t see this stopping me' from 2020 run | Fox NewMichael Bennet on cancer diagnosis: 'I donâ€™t see this stopping me' from 2020 ruSen. Bennet hopes President Trump signs the border deal: It's a reasonable compromissays heâ€™s optimistic heâ€™ll soon be running for president.The two-term Colorado Democrat â€“ who announced last week that he recently was diagnosed with prostate cancer â€“ told Fox News â€œI feel really lucky. It was caught early and this is a really treatable form of cancer and we have insurance. I think Iâ€™m going to be fine. I hope I willÂ because I really want to have the opportunity to run in 2020.â€ùBennet was interviewed Sunday as he campaigned in New Hampshire the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.BENNET ANNOUNCES HE HAS PROSTATE CANCEPointing to then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts â€“ the 2004 Democratic nominee who had successful cancer surgery at the onset of his presidential campaign â€“ Bennet 54 said â€œJohn was 59 when he had the same operation. He had it and two weeks later he was in California doing what he needed to do out there to campaign. So I take this seriously but if all goes well I donâ€™t see this stopping me.â€ùBennet didnâ€™t bring up his diagnosis during a question-and-answer session with the Rockingham County Democrats that lasted over an hour butÂ members of the crowd wished him well.â€œI donâ€™t feel the need to bring it up myself. Iâ€™m glad to talk about it if people want to raise itâ€ù he told Fox News.The diagnosis apparently hasnâ€™t slowed Bennet down on the campaign trail. The Exeter event was the second to last in a jam-packed two-day swing through New Hampshire. On Monday heâ€™s headed to Iowa which votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar.BENNET CRITICIZES REP. OMAR&amp;apos;S COMMENTS AS &amp;apos;HATEFUL&amp;apos;Bennet who said he had planned to declare his candidacy for president this month explained that he hoped to jump into the White House race a few weeks after next weekâ€™s surgery if he gets a clean bill of health.That wouldnâ€™t leave a lot of time for Bennet to make the stage at the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates set for late June.â€œWeâ€™ve made it a little bit harder on myself although I wouldnâ€™t have asked for this issueâ€ù he explained. â€œI think itâ€™s important to be on the debate stage whether itâ€™s the first debate or the second debate however youâ€™re able to do it and we will work to get on there. I donâ€™t want to make excuses for it but we slowed down a little bit.â€ùFIRST 2020 DEBATES TO BE HELD IN JUNWhen Bennet likely jumps into the race heâ€™ll be facing off against a large field of Democratic contenders (it currently stands at 17) many with bigger name ID and bigger campaign war chests. And thereâ€™s already a candidate from Colorado in the race. The stateâ€™s former two-term governor â€“ John Hickenlooper â€“ launched his campaign last month.Many of the leading contenders are supporters of the single-payer â€œMedicare for Allâ€ù health care proposal a top wish-list item for the progressive base of the Democratic Party.However Bennet isnâ€™t endorsing â€œMedicare for All.â€ù Instead he teamed up with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia to come up with a plan called â€œMedicare-Xâ€ùÂ which would establish a public option for people maintaining their private insurance.â€œI wouldnâ€™t even call it extreme or left wing or too progressive or any of that stuffâ€ù Bennet said when asked about â€œMedicare for All.â€ù â€œI know people out there want to have a public option to compete with private insurance. I know they want to have a choice and I know they donâ€™t want to be dictated by the federal government what that choice has to be. Thatâ€™s how I developed the idea for &amp;apos;Medicare X.&amp;apos;â€ùHe touted that his plan is â€œmore achievable.â€ùAnd pointing to President Trumpâ€™s efforts to scrap ObamaCare Bennet argued that â€œwe have a president who has spent his administration trying to take health care away from millions of Americans.â€ùBennet who served as superintendent of the Denver public school system before first winning election to the U.S. Senate in 2010 highlighted his push to reform education.â€œThis will make me unelectable but Iâ€™ll say it on the first day â€“ I think kids should go to school six days a week. And I donâ€™t think they should go to school nine months a year. I think they should go to school off and on year-roundâ€ù Bennet told the crowd.He highlighted that year-round school would narrow the achievement gap saying that â€œin the summertime the more affluent kids gain proficiency the less affluent kids lose proficiency.â€ùHe alsoÂ stressed that â€œthis is a place with a lot of low hanging fruit where we can make an enormous difference... with some very smart strategic (federal) funding we can revolutionize community colleges in this country and we could change dramatically what weâ€™re doing in K-12.â€ùBennet also urged that Democrats â€œneed a president and leadership in Washington thatâ€™s as strategic asâ€ù Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APâ€œItâ€™s not about nice. That guy is not nice. But itâ€™s about following through on what heâ€™s trying to doâ€ù he said of the longtime Republican senator from Kentucky. â€œWe need to be as strategic as McConnell.â€ùBut he added â€œI do not believe that we need to be as ruthless as McConnell.â€ùPaul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignâ€™ with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

I am immensely proud of our successes in transforming DHS to keep pace with our enemies and adversaries â€” whether it is in cyberspace or against emerging threats from new technologies.Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside. I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure Americaâ€™s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationâ€™s discourse. Our country - and the men and women of DHS - deserve to have all the tools and resources they need to execute the mission entrusted to them.I can say with confidence our homeland is safer today than when I joined the Administration. We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders combat illegal immigration obstruct the inflow of drugs and uphold our laws and values. We have responded decisively to record-breaking natural disasters and helped Americans rebuild. We have prevented the disruption of U.S. elections and guarded against foreign interference in our democracy.

Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didnâ€™t and they elected him anyway.""Mulvaney added that Democrats ""know"" they won&amp;apos;t get the returnsÂ and ""just want attention on the issue because they donâ€™t want to talk to us about policy.""

Both Democrats and Republicans have said former Trump fixer Michael Cohen islikely to face new charges of lying to Congresin the wake of his recent explosive testimony which seemed to contradict his previous statements on a variety of matters including whether he had sought a job in the Trump White House.And House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows R-N.C.touched off a firestorm last Augusafter claiming on Twitter that his office had ""hard evidence"" suggesting the FBI leaked information to the press and used the resulting articles to help obtain surveillance warrants.Â The claim stemmed in part from FBI intelligence analyst Jonathan Moffaâ€™s Friday testimony behind closed doors before the House Judiciary and Oversight committees.Nunes added: ""There are three [referrals] that I think are more complicated. ...Â So on the first one is FISA abuse and other matters. We believe there was a conspiracy to lie to the FISA court mislead the FISA court by numerous individuals that all need to be investigated and looked at that and we believe the [relevant] statute is the conspiracy statute. The second conspiracy one is involving manipulation of intelligence that also could ensnarl many Americans.""FBI BLAMES &amp;apos;SYSTEM WIDE SOFTWARE GLITCH&amp;apos; FOR MISSING STRZOK PAGE TEXTS --- STRZOK&amp;apos;S MUELLER PHONE TOTALLY WIPENunes asserted that ""we&amp;apos;ve had a lot of concerns with the way intelligence was used"" during the Trump-Russia probe.Just nine days before the FBI applied for a FISAÂ warrant to surveil Carter Page then a Trump campaign aide bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the applicationaccording to internal text messages obtained by Fox News in March.Redacted versions of FISA documents already released have revealed that the FBI extensivelyÂ relied ondocuments produced byÂ Christopher Steel an anti-Trump British ex-spy working for a firm funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to surveil Trump aide Carter Page. The FISA application did not clearly state that the firm was funded by the Clinton team and DNC.The leaked dossier and related FBI surveillancekickstarted a media frenzy on alleged Russia-Trump collusiothat ended with a whimper last month when it was revealed Special Counsel Robert Mueller&amp;apos;s probeconcluded finding no evidence of such a conspiracÂ despite several offersÂ by Russians to help the Trump campaign. Page was never charged with wrongdoing and he isÂ currently suing the DNC for defamation.DOJ guidelines preclude the FBI from omitting exculpatory evidence or misrepresenting sources in FISA applications.-- and Republicans have charged -- that the FBI improperly withheld evidence that would have suggested their surveillance targets during the Trump probe were in fact innocent.FBI INCORRECTLY ASSURED FISA COURT ON FOUR OCCASSIONS THAT YAHOO NEWS ARTICLE WAS INDEPENDENT BASIS TO SPY ON TRUMP AID""The third is what I would call a global leak referral"" Nunes said.Â ""So there are about a dozen highly sensitive classified information leaks that were given to only a few reporters over the last two-and-a-half-plus years. So you knowÂ we don&amp;apos;t know if there&amp;apos;s actually been any leak investigations that have been opened but we do believe that we&amp;apos;ve got pretty good information and a pretty good idea of who could be behind these leaks.""Nunes specifically named a series of known ""horrific""Â leaks including the leak of conversations between Trump and theleaders of Australia and Mexic and the transcripts of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn&amp;apos;s calls.Nunes noted that the eight criminal referrals could involve more than eight people and that a conspiracy referral could involve ""a dozen two dozen people."" He added that more referrals could be coming.""I think it&amp;apos;s impossible to ignore"" Nunes said. ""If the Mueller team was busting people for lying to the FBI --Â there are some pretty simple times when people lied to Congress for the sole purpose of obstructing our investigation.""(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

In December of that year Schiff said on CNN: ""The Russians offered help the campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help and the president made full use of that help. That is pretty damning whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not.""And in May of last year Schiff said on ABC that the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails is ""like Watergate in the sense that you had a break in at the Democratic headquarters in this case a virtual one not a physical break in and you had a president as part of a cover up."" Schiff said later that the Russia investigation is ""a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.""Despite Schiffâ€™s claims Mueller found no evidence of coordination or conspiracy involving Trump his campaign and the Russian government Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter released late last month.Now Trumpâ€™s Republican allies â€“ from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy â€“ are calling on Schiff to do everything from vacating his committee chairmanship to leavingÂ office.MUELLER NOT RECOMMENDING FURTHER INDICTMENTS AFTER REPORT TURNOVEâ€œHe owes an apology to the American public"" McCarthy said.Â â€œThere is no place in Adam Schiff&amp;apos;s world or in Congress that he should be chair of the intel committee.""McCarthy added: ""There is no way he could lead the intel committee and he should step back.""Schiff remains steadfast in his claims that there is evidence of wrongdoing â€œin plain sight.â€ùCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APâ€œI don&amp;apos;t regret calling out this president for what i consider deeply unethical and improper conduct and the moment we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous pointâ€ù he said.Schiff added: â€œThere is a risk when you have an immoral president a president who lacks in basic character who violates the norms of office.

"Ex-US Sen Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina dead | Fox NewEx-US Sen Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina deaErnest F. ""Fritz"" Hollings the silver-haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U.S. Senate has died. He was 97.Family spokesman Andy Brack who also served at times for Hollings as spokesman during his Senate career said Hollings died early Saturday.Hollings whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination retired from the Senate in 2005 one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South.He had served 38 years and two months making him among the longest-serving senators in history.Nevertheless Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term. The senior senator was Strom Thurmond first elected in 1954. He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history.SENATE REPUBLICANS ENACT PROCEDURAL CHANGE TO SPEED CONFIRMATION OF TRUMP JUDICIAL PICKIn his final Senate speech in 2004 Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election calling money ""the main culprit the cancer on the body politic.""""We don&amp;apos;t have time for each other we don&amp;apos;t have time for constituents except for the givers. ... We&amp;apos;re in real real trouble.""Hollings was a sharp-tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped.He sometimes blamed that failure on his background rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation.However South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s.Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958. He built a national reputation as a moderate when in his farewell address as governor he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University.""This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina&amp;apos;s choice a government of laws rather than a government of men"" he told lawmakers. Shortly afterward Clemson was peacefully integrated.In his 2008 autobiography ""Making Government Work"" Hollings wrote that in the 1950s ""no issue dominated South Carolina more than race"" and that he worked for a balanced approach.""I was &amp;apos;Mister-In-Between. The governor had to appear to be in charge; yet the realities were not on his side"" he wrote. ""I returned to my basic precept ... the safety of the people is the supreme law. I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed.""In the Senate Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers. He chaired the Commerce Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees.But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble. He once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum D-Ohio the ""senator from the B&amp;apos;nai B&amp;apos;rith"" and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen. Alan Cranston D-California as ""wetbacks.""Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.SEN. KAMALA HARRIS CO-SPONSORING BILL TO LET DREAMERS BE CAPITOL HILL INTERNEarly in his Senate career he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina one of the poorest states in the union.Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory.Hollings who made three trips to the war zone said he learned a lesson there.""It&amp;apos;s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time"" he wrote in his autobiography warning that America is now ""repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq.""Despite his changed views Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government.In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities helping lay the groundwork for the Women Infants and Children or WIC feeding program.A year later his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book ""The Case Against Hunger.""In 1982 Hollings proposed an across-the-board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid.He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act. Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm-Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget.Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq.In his later years port security was one of his main concerns.As he prepared to leave office he told The Associated Press: ""People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment. I never ever lived that way. ...

"Trump lawyer calls on IRS to reject Dem demands for tax returns says it would set â€˜dangerous precedentâ€™ | Fox NewTrump lawyer calls on IRS to reject Dem demands for tax returns says it would set â€˜dangerous precedentâ€™Democrats using obscure federal statute to try and get Trump's tax returnDemocrat lawmakers are demanding six years of the president's personal and business tax returns. Judge Andrew Napolitano explains how House lawmakers can make it happen.A lawyer for President Trump said in a letter Friday that Democratic efforts to get the IRS toturn over the presidentâ€™s tax returnare an attempt to harass a political opponentÂ and that it would set a â€œdangerous precedentâ€ù for the agency to turn them over.â€œFor good reason it would be a gross abuse of power for the majority to use tax returns as a weapon to attack harass and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandoraâ€™s box is opened the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nationâ€ù William S. Consovoy said in a letter to the Treasuryâ€™s general counsel.AOC REMINDS TRUMP IN TWEET ABOUT TAX RETURN REQUEST: &amp;apos;WE DIDN&amp;apos;T ASK YOU&amp;apos;House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal D-Mass. formally asked the IRS on Wednesday to provide six years of Trumpâ€™s tax returns -- the latest of a yearslong effort by Democrats to get access to Trumpâ€™s financial documents.Neal asked for Trumpâ€™s personal and business returns from 2013-18 and set April 10 as a deadline. Democrats say it is within their mandate of congressional oversight but the unprecedented move has been opposed by RepublicansÂ and is likely to foreshadow a lengthy legal fight.Trump has said repeatedly throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency that he canâ€™t make public his tax returns as he is under audit.In his letter Consovoy said that Neal â€œcannot legally requestâ€ù the information as the tax code guards taxpayer privacy with the exception of certain conditions -- which he says are not met.â€œEven if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the Presidentâ€™s tax returns and return information that purpose is not driving Chairman Nealâ€™s requestâ€ù he wrote.â€œHis request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speechâ€ù he added.HOUSE DEMS RAMP UP EFFORTS TO GET TRUMPâ€™S TAX RETURNS WILL â€˜TAKE ALL NECESSARY STEPSâ€™Consovoy also rejects Nealâ€™s claim that the committee is seeking to assess how the IRS audits and enforces tax law against a president asking why he did not request any other presidential tax returns.â€œThe answer of course is that Chairman Nealâ€™s request is not about examining IRS policy. It is about scoring political points against President Trumpâ€ù he said.â€œIf the IRS acquiesces to Chairman Nealâ€™s request it would set a dangerous precedentâ€ù he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APTrump was asked by reporters in California on Friday if he had any comment on the letter: ""I&amp;apos;m under audit.

The payment mechanism was similar to agreements MLB has with leagues in China South Korea and Japan.In exchange the Cuban federation had agreed to release all players aged 25 and older with at least six years of professional experience.Rubio: I won't diplomatically recognize Cuba as presiden2016 GOP candidate says he would reverse 'one-sided deal' and strip embassy titlIn the letter which was made public Monday afternoon the Treasury Department told MLB that the payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation constituted illegal business with the Cuban government. That reverses a ruling made by the Obama administration allowing the payments.U.S. law prohibits virtually all payments to the Cuban government under the 60-year embargo on the island but MLB argued the Cuban Baseball Federation which oversees all aspects of the sport on the island was not formally a part of the Cuban state.Opponents called that argument ridiculous given the tight control the highly regimented government maintains over virtually every aspect of life in Cuba.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS AP""The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society"" National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement. ""The Administration looks forward to working with MLB to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents and not as property of the Cuban State.""""We stand by the goal of the agreement which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba"" an MLB statement said.Without a formal path from Cuba to the major leagues hundreds of top players have left the island for good many making harrowing crossings on rafts and rickety boats in the years before Cuba abandoned a hated exit permit requirement for most of its citizens.White House targets Cuba Venezuela and NicaraguNational Security Adviser John Bolton brands the countries a 'troika of tyranny' while announcing new sanctions over human rights violations and political oppression.While such dangerous escapes were mostly eliminated with greater travel freedoms players still needed to cut ties with Cuban baseball and often their families and hometowns going years without returning after signing with the major leagues.""The deal with Major League Baseball is an attempt to stop human trafficking encourage cooperation and elevate the level of baseball"" the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter. ""The politically motivated attacks on the deal hurt players their families and fans.""Last week the Cuban federation released a list of 34 players eligible to sign contracts with major league clubs. The players were aged between 17 and 25 years classified as international amateurs under MLB rules and eligible to sign minor league contracts. No likely stars were apparent on the list but more notable players included 22-year-old Raidel Martinez Perez and 23-year-old LivÃ¡n Moinelo Pita who have played professionally in Japan; 17-year-old infielder Loidel ChapellÃ_ Zulueta; and 18-year-old pitcher Norge Carlos Vera Aldana.Fox News&amp;apos; John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignâ€™ with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

The move alsoÂ allows the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with material support or prosecute them for sanctions violations.In a statement Trump said the unprecedented move â€œunderscores the fact that Iranâ€™s actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments.â€ùHe warned: â€œIf you are doing business with the IRGC you will be bankrolling terrorism.Â This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences.â€ùPOMPEO VOWS TO PILE ECONOMIC POLITICAL PRESSURE ON IRAAdministration officials have said the step will further isolate Iran and make clear that the U.S. won&amp;apos;t tolerate Iran&amp;apos;s continued support for rebel groups and others that destabilize the Middle East.""The IRGC&amp;apos;s active support for terrorism is unacceptable and the Department of Justice continues to support the administration&amp;apos;s efforts to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its actions"" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.The designation howeverÂ may also have widespread implications for American personnel and policy in the region and elsewhere as Iran has threatened to retaliate.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APIt will also complicate diplomacy.

It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed.â€ù2020 DEMOCRATS PLEDGE REPARATIONS SUPPORT AT SHARPTON CONFERENCThe measure is a Senate companion to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives in January by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas which if passed into law would set up a commission to study the impact of slavery and continued discrimination against black Americans and make recommendations on reparation proposals for the descendants of slaves. The legislation was first introduced 30 years ago by then-Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.â€œSince slavery in this country we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generationsâ€ù Booker added. â€œMany of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class have systematically excluded blacks through practices like GI Bill discrimination and redlining.â€ùBesides Booker the idea of slavery reparations for black AmericansÂ is at least partially backed by at least eight other Democratic presidential contenders.

They intentionally edited the headline to make it sound like a hunger protest when in reality it was immigrants trying to evade deportation knowing that the government has their address through the food stamp program.The other very important thing to take into account here is that the only people that should be worried about deportation are those that entered the country illegally and they shouldnâ€™t be living off of our tax dollars to begin with.So in reality this Washington Post story is only showing that finally illegal immigrants know they will be deported because we have a president that doesnâ€™t hand out taxpayer money with a bow to them.The Washington Post just keeps diving lower and lower into the swamp and it couldnâ€™t be any more obvious.It is a good thing that illegal immigrants are stealing our tax dollars but apparently The Washington Post and the Democrats donâ€™t see it that way.Share this everywhere to make sure no one believes The Washington Post ever again!Alex only wants freedom to reign so he tries to achieve that the best way he knows how by sharing news.The Trump Effect Is Real!

No evidence of collusion.â€ùNunes was also asked whether he thinks there are elements inside the intelligence community or FBI leaking information to undercut the Trump presidency.â€œItâ€™s pretty clear that thatâ€™s happeningâ€ù he said.â€œThereâ€™s even been stories written about it in numerous newspapers talking about how they said they left breadcrumbs around to hurt the Trump administration.â€ùHopefully this will clear the entire mess up so the country can move on and continue to prosper under our rightfully elected president.Leave this to the mainstream media to try and twist or try and throw doubt on the announcement but the jury is out and they are just lying like they have been since Trump decided to run.We canâ€™t let them do that so it is up to us to make sure that the message stays as clear as Devin Nunes said it.THERE IS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND RUSSIA IN REGARDS TO THE ELECTION.Share this everywhere so our country can move on!Alex only wants freedom to reign so he tries to achieve that the best way he knows how by sharing news.BREAKING: Secret Service Agent Was Let Go For Scary Reason!

He has spent his whole life bull sh*tting. He has succeeded by bull sh*tting. He has gotten into the Presidency by bull sh*tting.

Zuckerberg apologized for those errors. About two-thirds through the lengthy letter Zuckerberg says Facebookâ€™s existing content regulation strategies are not sophisticated enough for the current political climate.In particular he pointed out mistakes Facebook made in removing videos capturing police violence that were important to the Black Lives Matter movement and in removing iconic photo â€œThe Terror of War.â€ùWeâ€™ve seen this in misclassifying hate speech in political debates in both directions Ã¢Â€Â” taking down accounts and content that should be left up and leaving up content that was hateful and should be taken dowThis has been painful for me because I often agree with those criticizing us that weâ€™re making mistakes.He says these errors in judgment resulted from â€œoperational scaling issuesâ€ù meaning Facebook hasnâ€™t been able to keep up with its own growth.

Even for Obama at least it was clear that he hated America up front.Republicans pretend to be the patriots but these slimeballs are the exact oppositeTheir dishonesty is sickening. At least the Democrats are upfront about their America hatred (which is why they are losing).Why doesnâ€™t John Mccain just cut be truthful for once and cross the floor to the Democrats.We are ONTO YOU JOHN MCCAIN.

They do not exist.The only problem is thatÃ‚Â According to theIn an impassioned address Friday Pope Francis denied the existence of Islamic terrorism while simultaneously asserting that Ã¢Â€Âœthe ecological crisis is real.Ã¢Â€ÂùÃ¢Â€ÂœChristian terrorism does not exist Jewish terrorism does not exist and Muslim terrorism does not exist. They do not existÃ¢Â€Âù Francis said in his speech to a world meeting of populist movements.What he apparently meant is that not all Christians are terrorists and not all Muslims are terroristsÃ¢Â€Â”a fact evident to allÃ¢Â€Â”yet his words also seemed to suggest that no specifically Islamic form of terrorism exists in the world an assertion that stands in stark contradiction to established fact.Ã¢Â€ÂœNo people is criminal or drug-trafficking or violentÃ¢Â€Âù Francis said while also suggestingÃ¢Â€Â”as he has on other occasionsÃ¢Â€Â”that terrorism is primarily a result of economic inequalities rather than religious beliefs. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe poor and the poorer peoples are accused of violence yet without equal opportunities the different forms of aggression and conflict will find a fertile terrain for growth and will eventually explode.Ã¢Â€ÂùThe Pope also reiterated his conviction that all religions promote peace and that the danger of violent radicalization exists equally in all religions.Pope Francis is not only disastrously wrongheaded about an obvious factbut he is also misleading andÃ‚Â deceiving his followers.The leader of the Catholic Church also condemned the denial of global warming urging his audience that Ã¢Â€Âœthe ecological crisis is realÃ¢Â€Âù.He said: Ã¢Â€ÂœA very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system.Ã¢Â€ÂœWe know what happens when we deny science and disregard the voice of nature.Pelosi Caught On Hot Mic Telling Rep To â€œTell Them Your A Muslimâ€ù' + arr_splits[i] + '"" + formated_str + """,0

The 448 would presumably be a mix of illegal immigrants and noncitizens who are in the U.S. legally such as visa holders or permanent residents.According to the Times James Agresti of Just Facts examined the results applied it to 2013 U.S. Census data and concluded that as many as 2.1 million Hispanics could have been illegally registered to vote.WOW this is epic! This means that president Trump is being robbed by huge popular victory something that liberals are now using as weapon against him to undermine him and ridicule him and insult him!But now we know that he is an absolute winner Ã¢Â€Â“ both electoral and popular winner in this elections!

Millions of Americans are fed up with intellectually dishonest politicians were not looking up for them.But for every action there is a reaction. And the law of unintended consequences is now hitting President Trump. And thatâ€™s because the swamp is inhabited by many different creatures â€” some of whom want to destroy the president.Right now the national media despises Mr. Trump as we have pointed out and backed up with facts.Also some folks working for the federal government want to damage the president. Ã¢Â€Â“ ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why you are seeing the leaks from intelligence agencies and other federal bureaucracies.Now all presidents have to deal with leaks. But in this political climate the press gleefullyaccepts information from anonymous sources and spins it negative against Trump.As we pointed out on Wednesday night the public and press donâ€™t know what General Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador. We will know. But we donâ€™t now.Also whether there is any truth to allegations that people working on the Trump campaign had meaningful contact with the Russia government. We donâ€™t know.HereÃ¢Â€Â™s what civil rights activist Al Sharpton said on February 15 on the Tom Joyner radio show:Ã¢Â€ÂœIf there was dialogue and negotiations with the Russians with the Russians which is clearly against the law and clearly an act that cannot be pardoned. If the president knew while it was going on and it did not stop it or in some way authorized it that can be impeachable.Ã¢Â€ÂùItÃ¢Â€Â™s not against the law for anyone to talk with any Russian. General Flynn had no power other than being a private citizen when the call with the Russian ambassador to took place. In order for him to have committed a crime he would have had to attempt to formally attempt to undermine the Obama administrationÃ¢Â€Â™s Russian policy. So Sharpton is full of it as always.Also as we said Wednesday night if thereÃ¢Â€Â™s truth to those allegations they should be taken very seriously when the facts are presented.When President Trump first mentioned draining the swamp in Washington I donâ€™t believe he understood how extensive the problem really is. After eight years of President Obama there are many people working in the federal government who like the former president and who despise Mr. Trump.So the Trump administration has its hands full.Since 2011 Editorial Journalist Blogger Author of 20 Books Tech Writer Computer Programmer Website Developer and now Columnist For USA Politics Today!Trump Slams â€˜Out Of Controlâ€™ MediTrump Waging War On Leaks And DisinformatioTrump Backing Away From Palestinian Stat' + arr_splits[i] + '"" + formated_str + """,0

However Trump was still the Republican candidate which makes it amazing that a speaker would backstab his nominee in such a way.Ryan can be heard on the audio sayinÃ¢Â€ÂœI am not going to defend Donald Trump Ã¢Â€Â” not now not in the futureÃ¢Â€Âù Ryan can be heard saying.This is not good for Ryan especially considering how much trumpâ€™s supporters hate Ryan and the Republican establishment.These revelations give validity to the likes of Steven Bannon who has always warned Trump of the dangers that Paul Ryan presents.A spokesperson for Ryan told Breitbart that the audio is nothing new saying â€œThe world is well aware of this history. â€_ And obviously a lot has happened since then. As everyone knows.â€ùA Full Transcript Of Ryanâ€™s Comments can be see below.Ã¢Â€ÂœHis comments are not anywhere in keeping with our partyÃ¢Â€Â™s principles and values There are basically two things that I want to make really clear as for myself as your Speaker. I am not going to defend Donald Trump Ã¢Â€Â” not now not in the future. As you probably heard I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend Ã¢Â€Â” a thing I do every year. And IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days Look you guys know I have real concerns with our nominee.Ã‚Â I hope you appreciate that IÃ¢Â€Â™m doing what I think is best for you the members not whatÃ¢Â€Â™s best for me. So I want to do whatÃ¢Â€Â™s best for our members and I think this is the right thing to do. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to focus my time on campaigning for House Republicans. I talked to a bunch of you over the last 72 hours and here is basically my takeaway. To everyone on this call this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. Some of you are not But with respect to Donald Trump I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally you need to decide whatÃ¢Â€Â™s best for you. And you all know whatÃ¢Â€Â™s best for you where you are. But the last thing I want to do is to help Hillary Clinton get the presidency and get Congress. Look sheÃ¢Â€Â™s a failed progressive. SheÃ¢Â€Â™s running an abysmal campaign. I mean itÃ¢Â€Â™s just Ã¢Â€Â” itÃ¢Â€Â™s amazing how easily she could be beaten She will take this country in the wrong direction. And the last thing we need is four more years of Obama policies or two years of a Clinton presidency with a Democrat Congress. Could you imagine what that would look like? So the last thing we want to be doing is giving Hillary Clinton a blank check in Congress. ThatÃ¢Â€Â™s why IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to spend the rest of this month fighting for Congress fighting for our majorities IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to spend the next 28 days working hard with all of our members to get re-elected because we need a check on Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump and Mike Pence donÃ¢Â€Â™t win the presidency Greg Walden will get more into what that looks like and what polling looks like but I want to basically close with this: His comments are indefensible theyÃ¢Â€Â™re not in keeping with our principles so IÃ¢Â€Â™m not going to try to defend him. IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to focus on Congress IÃ¢Â€Â™m going to focus on upholding our values. We have a great great policy agenda Ã¢Â€Â” A Better Way Ã¢Â€Â” that we need to take to voters and show what our party actually stands for and what itÃ¢Â€Â™s stood for for generations.Ã¢Â€ÂùRachel Maddow is blaming her viewers for the Trump tax debacle Ã¢Â€Â“ hereÃ¢Â€Â™s why!TrumpÃ¢Â€Â™s budget director shocked liberals with blunt answer on climate change!Frantic search for Secret Service STOLEN laptop containing Trump Tower floor plans!' + arr_splits[i] + '"" + formated_str + """,0

As a victim of Soviet communism Merkel was always going to be listened to carefully on the question of morality. And given her longevity she was always going to be respected.

Trugman at the New York Post reported this week that the final numbers for the Obama Administration are in and they are abysmal:On Thursday we closed the book on the Obama economic Ã¢Â€ÂœmiracleÃ¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€Â” and itÃ¢Â€Â™s a miracle we are not in a recession.Last week the Commerce Department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product. The number came in at a paltry 2.1 percent meaning that growth during President ObamaÃ¢Â€Â™s final year in office Ã¢Â€Â” the end of an Ã¢Â€ÂœError of HopeÃ¢Â€Âù Ã¢Â€Â” landed with a big thud at just 1.6 percent.That low-water mark puts the Obama presidency in last place among all the post-World War II presidents when it comes to economic growth.The rate of real economic growth is the single greatest determinant of both AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s strength as a nation and the well-being of the American people.From 1790 to 2000 U.S. RGDP growth averaged 3.79%. America needs at least 3.0% economic growth-the nation cannot defend itself and pay its bills without it. However AmericaÃ¢Â€Â™s elites have largely given up on growth and are now distracting themselves with academic musings about Ã¢Â€Âœsecular stagnation.Ã¢Â€ÂùBy February of 2016 it was clear that Obama had given up on economic growth. ObamaÃ¢Â€Â™s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasted in early 2016 that America will never see 3.0% economic growth again.As a result of his failed economic policies Obama now ranks as the fourth worst presidency on record in GDP growth at 1.6%. Only Herbert Hoover (-5.65%) Andrew Johnson (-0.70%) and Theodore Roosevelt (1.41%) currently have lower average annual GDP growth than Barack Obama. In addition Obama has the lowest annual GDP growth rate of any President since World War II.Barack Obama is the only U.S. president in history who did not deliver a single year of 3.0%+ economic growth.Here are the average growth rates for each president since World War II:G.H.W. Bush (1989-92) 2.3 percenG.W.

Kaine proposes &amp;apos;Medicare-X&amp;apos; health insurance plan - Daily PresKaine proposes 'Medicare-X' health insurance plaSenator Tim Kaine right makes a point while giving a speech at the University of Louisville Monday April 1 2019 in Louisville KY. On left is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Pat McDonogh/Courier Journal via AP) (Pat McDonogh / AP)â€™s network of doctors and hospitals could make coverage affordable for Americans now priced out of the market Sen.The Virginia Democrat and Sen. D-Colo. are trying again with their â€œMedicare-Xâ€ù idea of offering a government-run health insurance option.Because the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services donâ€™t need to earn a profit market  coverage or pay the high salaries private insurers give executives Kaine said Medicare-X policies would likely cost 10 to 15 percent less than those currently on offer through theBut the idea is that Medicare-X would offer the same benefits as Obamacare policies â€” including pediatric and obstetrics care not currently covered by Medicare. As with Medicare and the Obamacare policies people with pre-existing conditions could not be denied coverage.The bill also echoes an initiative offered by Rep. Robert C. â€œBobbyâ€ù Scott D-Newport News and other senior House Democrats â€” offering people with incomes exceeding 400 percent of the federal poverty line subsidies for their coverage.In addition Kaine and Bennet propose capping premiums for Medicare-X coverage depending on income. For people at 600 percent of the poverty line or above that cap would be 13 percent of household income.Wondering what youâ€™ll be hearing aselection campaigns heat up? Hereâ€™s one hint: health insurance.(as expected â€” or possibly even anticipated byleaders) vetoed Republican legislatorsâ€™ high-profile push for health insurance law changes they argued would...â€œThat should ease a lot of anxietyâ€ù that comes from the current unpredictability of private insurersâ€™ premium increases Kaine said.â€œIf you want options and lower costs weâ€™ve got the bill for youâ€ù Kaine said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday.The premiums for Medicare-X policies would be designed to cover costs so the program would not affect the finances of current Medicare.In fact Kaine said there should be savings to the government if Americans buy a public option coverage. The lower premiums would require smaller subsidies than do current Obamacare policies.Bennet said the idea is to take a practical step toward covering uninsured Americans adding that he did not see Medicare-X as either a first step to other Democratsâ€™ â€œMedicare for allâ€ù plans â€” supported by several 2020 presidential candidates â€” or as a rejection of those ideas.He and Kaine propose introducing Medicare-X by 2021 in areas where there is currently only one private insurer offering Obamacare coverage expanding it to the rest of the country by 2024 and offering it as an option for small businesses seeking coverage for employees by 2025.An earlier version gained little traction in 2017 and while the idea of a â€œpublic optionâ€ù was floated for the Affordable Care Act it never made it to the final version that became law in 2010.Jimmy Carter ss now the longest-living US President.

Virginia should do more to help foster kids find homes with family advocates say - Daily PresVirginia should do more to help foster kids find homes with family advocates saAileen Devlin/Daily Press / Daily PresDemocratic state Sen. Monty Mason walks to his seat on the first day of the Virginia General Assembly at the State Capitol in Richmond on Wednesday Jan. 10 2018. (Aileen Devlin/Daily Press / Daily Press)Virginia is full of grandparents and other relatives eager to take care of children otherwise headed for foster care but the state lags the rest of the nation when it comes to making this common-sense idea happen new data show.The problem advocates for children say is money.When a relative wants to take in a child they donâ€™t receive the payments that foster care parents or group homes do.â€œIf youâ€™re going to be a foster parent for my kid youâ€™d get $700 a month; if my brother does he gets nothingâ€ù said state Sen. Monty Mason D-Williamsburg.â€œReal world case: I had a couple come in he works at the ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control department) warehouse â€_ his sisterâ€™s not not doing well and theyâ€™ve got two hours to decide what to do about her kids. If they donâ€™t help the boy goes to Virginia Beach the girl to Roanokeâ€ù Mason said. â€œSo of course they take the kids. Now theyâ€™ve got five and debtâ€™s piling up and theyâ€™re struggling.â€ùOnly 7 percent of Virginia children in foster care have a place with a relative the Annie E. Casey Foundationâ€™s latest analysis of federal Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System data show.That percentage hasnâ€™t changed in 10 years and is a fraction of the national average of 32 percent.Mason says the figures miss an important trend â€” the overall number of children in foster care in Virginia is down in part because of a stepped-up effort to find alternatives. Often thatâ€™s an informal agreement for a relative to care for a child.â€œBut thereâ€™s no help for them â€_ and you know you bring a 13-year-old boy into your home your grocery bill is going to soarâ€ù Mason said.That kind of informal diversion doesnâ€™t count as kinship care but even when a child formally enters the foster care system and is placed with relatives thereâ€™s no stipend Mason said.Tackling that needs to be a top priority said Allison Gilbreath a policy analyst with Voices for Virginiaâ€™s Children a non-profit advocacy group.â€œAll the data show children do much better with kinship placementâ€ù she said. â€œThey usually know the child better. Theyâ€™re more likely to stick with them too.â€ùChildren in kinship care are more likely to be adopted or to end up back with their birth parents which is supposed to be the systemâ€™s top goal Gilbreath said.authorized the state to tap into a federal program that pays some kinship guardians. But only about 100 kids are eligible for this Gilbreath said.The reason is that to get the assistance the child must have lived with the relative for six months and the relative must have completed state training to become a certified foster parent. In addition the federal program says it wonâ€™t pay unless the child is never going to return to his or her birth parents â€” a decision children can make only after theyâ€™ve turned 14.Gilbreath said she hopes Virginia will expand access by creating a separate funding stream for kinship care as other states have.Virginia foster care kids are far less likely than young people elsewhere in the nation to find a permanent placement â€” only 24 percent of Virginia children do compared to 43 percent for the nation as a whole according to the data compiled by the Casey Foundation.Since many kids in foster care got there because of trauma at home they often need help that other children donâ€™t â€” and making sure they have access to those services ought to be another state priority Gilbreath said.â€œYou may have taken in a child and suddenly you have to figure out â€˜How do I sign them up for school? Whereâ€™s the other help they need?â€™ â€ù Gilbreath said.Sheâ€™s hoping the new federal Family First Prevention Services Act will bring money and evidence-based services to help kids. Mason meanwhile sponsored the legislation this year that aims at getting Virginia on a fast track to tap those federal resources.Pictures from Daily Press PhotographerVirginia is full of grandparents and other relatives eager to take care of children otherwise headed for foster care but the state lags the rest of the nation when it comes to making this common-sense idea happen new data show.The problem advocates for children say is money.,0

Once again Hampton Roads braces for battle on aircraft carriers - Daily PresOnce again Hampton Roads braces for battle on aircraft carrierDavid B. Hollingsworth / The Virginian-PiloThe USS Harry S. Truman could be slated for early retirement if the Navy has its way. The ship is shown here returning from deployment in December. (David B. Hollingsworth / The Virginian-Pilot)Two years ago President Donald Trump made a dramatic entrance at Newport News Shipbuilding and promised to expand the aircraft carrier fleet. It was his biggest applause line.That promise appeared to bear fruit in January when the shipyard signed a two-carrier contract with the Navy. It was the first bulk-buy of the nuclear-powered behemoths since the Reagan administration.Now the Pentagonâ€™s latest proposal has local leaders scratching their heads. The Pentagon wants to mothball the Norfolk-based aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman halfway through its intended 50-year service life.â€œItâ€™s just very short-sighted what the presidentâ€™s budget wants to doâ€ù said Rep. Rob Wittman R-Westmoreland who pushed for the two-carrier purchase.Navy leaders still plan to expand the fleet. Currently at 289 ships they expect to reach 314 in about five years. The long-range goal is 355 ships although the mix of vessels is still open to debate.But they can save at least $3.4 billion by skipping the Trumanâ€™s midlife overhaul a massive upgrade scheduled to begin in 2024. Cancelling the overhaul â€” something thatâ€™s never been done â€” would essentially result in the ship being retired early since its nuclear fuel would run out and not be replenished.Making the proposal was â€œa very difficult decisionâ€ù said Rear Adm. Randy Crites but it would allow the Navy to invest in next-generation war-fighting tools. That includes investment in a pair of unmanned surface ships about the size of small Coast Guard cutters.That trade-off doesnâ€™t hold water with Rep. Elaine Luria D-Virginia Beach. The former Navy commander along with Wittman sits on the influential sea power subcommittee of the House Armed Services which will hear from Navy leaders next week.â€œIf something breaks out in the world I donâ€™t think the president turns to the secretary of defense and says â€˜Where are my unmanned surface vessels?â€™ He says â€˜Where are my aircraft carriers?â€™ â€ù she said.Craig Quigley is the executive director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance. Like others he was caught by surprise by the Pentagonâ€™s proposal to skip overhaul formally known as a Refueling and Complex Overhaul or RCOH.â€œI just donâ€™t understand the logic unless itâ€™s cost avoidanceâ€ù he said. â€œIf that trumped everything else well then I guess I at least understand the proposal. I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s a strategically smart decision.â€ùThe Navy wonâ€™t save much money over the short term by skipping the RCOH said Bryan Clark a retired naval officer and analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good trade-offâ€ù he said. â€œThe technology the Navy is trying to buy now isnâ€™t helped by the canceling of the Truman (overhaul.)Another argument against the move focuses on taxpayer investment. The Truman was built to last 50 years but would only serve for 25.â€œThey will save $3.4 billion but will lose the investment of 25 yearsâ€ù said Vinod Agarwal an economist at Old Dominion University. â€œIt simply does not make economic sense.â€ùThe Newport News shipyard a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries is the sole designer and builder of nuclear-powered carriers for the Navy. It is also the only shipyard capable of handling the RCOH.Lasting several years the overhaul results in a completely refurbished ship and provides business for thousands of suppliers across the country.RCOH schedules are tightly coordinated. As one ship leaves another is supposed to arrive. Skipping a RCOH creates problems at the shipyard which is Virginiaâ€™s largest industrial employer.Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he does not expect employment to suffer because the two-carrier contract would compensate for loss.â€œPart of the calculus here was to maintain employment. In fact with (this) decision we grow employment in the industrial baseâ€ù he told a Senate panel last week. â€œWe want to make sure that not only the shipyards maintain their employment thereâ€™s actually growth but also (growth in) the supply chain.â€ùHII spokeswoman Beci Brenton did not specifically address employment but said the RCOH cancellation would be felt well beyond the shipyard and the aircraft carrier program.Saving money by skipping the job comes with a cost.â€œIt will decrease what we buy and order from our base of 680 vendors in 40 states and will drive costs significantly higher on several Navy shipbuilding and maintenance programsâ€ù she said in an email.A reported proposal to mothball a Norfolk-based aircraft carrier halfway through its 50-year service life is already drawing fire from key members of Congress.wants to skip the midlife overhaul of the USS Harry S. Truman scheduled to begin around 2024...Key lawmakers from both parties have lined up against the proposal. The Navy shipbuilding budget will get a full airing next week in hearings before the sea power panels in both the House and Senate armed services committees.Rep. Joe Courtney D-Conn. who chairs the House sea power panel has already signaled his skepticism along with Wittman and Luria who is the vice chairman.â€œI think Iâ€™m not going to be moved by the prospect of unknown untested technologies and unmanned surface vehiclesâ€ù Luria said. â€œItâ€™s kind of backwards to say weâ€™re going to build the thing then figure out what to do with it.â€ùHampton Roads has been down this road before.In 2013-14 Congress considered early retirement of the USS George Washington instead of going through with its RCOH. At the time the Navy was dealing with across-the-board budget cuts but Congress opposed the move and the Obama White House eventually put in the extra money.Aircraft carriers make tempting targets for budget-cutters because of the expensive price tag. The newest carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford costs about $12.9 billion.â€œIf youâ€™re looking for real money to get to some of these other mission areas Iâ€™m not going to get there by trimming around the edgesâ€ù Quigley said. â€œIâ€™ve got to go where the money is.â€ùEven if the Truman proposal is scuttled expect Congress to debate the future of aircraft carriers for years to come. Many factors will drive the discussion.The U.S. already has far more carriers than any other country. Military experts have questioned the vulnerability of the ships. China is developing long-range weapons that could force carriers to stay farther offshore making it more difficult for their fighter jets to reach their targets.Clark the naval analyst sees the Truman debate as a strategic move driven largely by Pentagon leaders who doubt the effectiveness of carrier-based aircraft in any fight against China..They accepted the two-carrier purchase while not being sold on the future of carrier air power in that corner of the globe.â€œAs long as there are questions among leaders in (the Pentagon) about the viability of the carrier air wing this will be an issueâ€ù he said.Quigley said he doesnâ€™t underestimate what China is developing but carrier defenses have evolved too.â€œSuch is the nature of naval warfareâ€ù he said.â€œWe shouldnâ€™t look at a carrier as being uniquely vulnerableâ€ù she said. â€œItâ€™s really the most survivable airfield in the world.â€ùThe Aircraft Carrier USS Abraham Lincoln departs Naval Station Norfolk.

"Get ready for a dose of health care politicking - Daily PresGet ready for a dose of health care politickinVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam center shakes the hand of Del. Lee Ware R-Powhatan left as he leaves the House chambers after delivering his ""State of the Commonwealth"" (Steve Helber / AP)Wondering what youâ€™ll be hearing aselection campaigns heat up? Hereâ€™s one hint: health insurance.(as expected â€” or possibly even anticipated byleaders) vetoed Republican legislatorsâ€™ high-profile push for health insurance law changes they argued would ease the burden on individuals struggling to paypolicy premiums without the tax subsidies provided to people earning less than 400 percent of the poverty line (that translates to $49960 for a single person and $103000 for a family of four).The measures would have allowed all Virginians to buy the less expensive catastrophic coverage plans now available only to people under 30 and would also have extended the length of time people could be covered under less costly short-term coverage.Northam argued the bills would have put Virginians at risk of not having enough insurance and would fragment the stateâ€™s insurance market in a way leading to rapidly increasing premiums for all.Texas and 17 other states sued the United States over thebut now that a federal judge down there has ruled the entire act is invalid the Trump Administration has decided Texas and those other mostly southern and wheat-belt states (nine of which have declined to use Obamacare...â€œMany individuals enrolled in a catastrophic health plan may forego medical services because of costâ€ù Northam said in one of his veto statements.And in those addressing short term coverage he said: â€œShort-term limited-duration plans are allowed to discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions impose lifetime and annual caps and are not required to provide essential health benefits.â€ùRepublicans saw things a different way.â€œGovernor Northam continues to prevent Virginians from even being allowed the option of choosing a health care plan that better meets their needs and their budgetsâ€ù declared Senate President pro tempore R-Bedford who serves as chairman of the Senate Education and Health Committee.None of the bill passed the House of Delegates with veto-proof margins winning on pretty much party-line splits. Two drew bipartisan support in the state Senate. It takes a two-thirds vote in both House and Senate to override a governorâ€™s veto.Meanwhile the Trump Administration moved unexpectedly to challenge the Affordable Care Act deciding to support Texas and 17 other states sued that the United States in their challenge to the law. Although Texas and the others sued the United States the Department of Justice has decided not to continue the battle in an appeals court.â€œThe Department of Justice has determined that the district courtâ€™s judgment should be affirmedâ€ù assistant attorney general Joseph Hunt wrote in a brief two sentence note to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.He did not outline the administrationâ€™s reasoning.But itâ€™s no secret says Sen.â€œThe Trump Administration has long wanted to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act which would take health care away from millions of people and threaten protections for those with pre-existing conditionsâ€ù Kaine said.The issue is the ACA requirement that all Americans have health insurance. When the federal tax reform of 2017 removed the tax penalties for failing to buy insurance Texas and the other states argued that the insurance mandate on its own was unconstitutional. A federal judge in Texas agreed and held that meant the entire act was invalid. meanwhile joined 21 other state attorneys general in support of the ACA and in opposition to the Texas-led groupâ€™s lawsuit.â€œThis politically motivated lawsuit is dangerous reckless and risks the health of Americansâ€ù Herring said.For Virginia overturning the Affordable Care Act would stop the Medicaid expansion which has already covered more than 200000 low income Virginians and is set to cover roughly 400000 in all Herring said. It would allow insurers to resume denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or allow insurers to charge those individuals more for coverage and put an end to the $1.15 billion in tax credits that helped 335000 Virginians afford insurance in 2017.Bipartisan efforts to end Virginiaâ€™s practice of suspending driversâ€™ licenses when people miss payments of court fines and fees ran into a roadblock at House subcommittee during the 2019 General Assembly session â€” but Gov. Ralph Northam may have found a way around.The governor wants to amend the state budget to remove the current requirement to suspend licenses for those unpaid court costs. His amendment would also restore licenses to some 627000 Virginians whose driving privileges are suspended because of unpaid fines.â€œThe practice of suspending a personâ€™s driverâ€™s license for nonpayment of court fines and costs is inequitableâ€”itâ€™s past time we end itâ€ù Northam said. â€œA driverâ€™s license is critical to daily life including a personâ€™s ability to maintain a job. Eliminating a process that envelops hundreds of thousands of Virginians in a counterproductive cycle is not only fair itâ€™s also the right thing to do.â€ùhas some powerful gatekeepers â€” as the tale of a reform meant to stop a revolving door at jails shows.The reform was simple enough: to end the requirement in state law to suspend a driverâ€™s license if he or she doesnâ€™t pay court fees and fines or make some immediate...Two bills to do that had sailed through the state Senate on votes of 36-4 and 38-2 but died in the House of Delegatesâ€™ criminal justice subcommittee a panel known for taking a tough line on proposals a majority of its member see as easing penalties for violating the law.The subcommitteeâ€™s thumbs down kept the driverâ€™s license measures from reaching the full House for a vote. But when the legislature reconvenes early next month a gubernatorial budget amendment goes directly to the full House first and then if it passes that body to the Senate. Gubernatorial amendments to the budget or to bills require a majority vote in both House and Senate.State Sen. Bill Stanley R-Franklin County who sponsored one of the bills that died in the House subcommittee has said his nose count at the time suggested the measure would have won 70 to 80 votes in the House.â€œThis will get it to the floorâ€ù Stanley said of his friend Northamâ€™s amendment.Stanley whose frustration with the roadblock in the House erupted publicly this year suggested to Northam that a budget amendment might be a way to let Republicans in the House have a chance to consider the issue.He thinks thereâ€™s a shot â€” at least as long as the idea isnâ€™t seen as a partisan Democratic issue. And he has a reason for believing the idea of ending license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees will win support.Stanleyâ€™s been pushing to end those suspensions for three years. He has managed to convince most of his fellow GOP senators that suspending licenses for unpaid fees is in a sense an unfair punishment for not paying a tax as well as a huge hurdle for Virginians trying to make amends for past offenses as they get back on their feet. In a way he says ending the suspensions is about helping Virginians secure their independence and liberty.And while a budget amendment only lasts for the life of a budget â€” a bit more than a year in this case â€” Stanley believes Northamâ€™s idea if it doesnâ€™t get hung up in the heated partisan politics of a legislative election year will set the stage for a more permanent fix.â€œWhen people see the sky didnâ€™t fall and the sun kept rising with those license restorations I think it will change some mindsâ€ù he said.Jimmy Carter ss now the longest-living US President.

While you were sleeping Congress was shutting down the government â€” and then reopening it â€” in a familiar display of dysfunction. It's the second time this year lawmakers have let funding lapse while they staged standoffs intended to draw attention to their causes.The first was a result of' strategy on immigration. But Friday's episode was less about strategy and more about aimless drift. After little action Thursday a single senator dug in forcing the Senate to stall and miss the midnight deadline. Like kids scrambling to clean up before Mom and Dad get home lawmakers then had to rush to turn the lights back on before federal employees were due to report to work.A recap of the action overnight and early Friday:HOW DID WE GET HERE?The government has been operating on funding from a series of short-term spending measures. Three weeks ago Senate Democrats dug in and decided to use a deadline to try to forceto work with them on a deal for ""Dreamer"" immigrants whose protections from deportation are due to expire in March. No deal came together and the government shut down over the weekend. Ultimately Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. agreed to hold votes on an unspecified immigration bill in return for Democrats' votes to reopen the government for three more weeks.DIDN'T THEY HAVE A DEAL?Yes. Senate leaders used the three weeks to hash out a two-year $400 billion budget agreement. McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced it Wednesday lauding it as a major breakthrough. The deal found support in both parties largely because it has something for everyone â€” both the military spending Republicans wanted and the money for domestic programs Democrats sought. It also includes $89 billion for disaster relief sought by both parties.The bill does nothing on immigration. That's the problem for Democrats especially in the House where no vote has been promised on Dreamers who have lived in the country illegally since they were children. For some Republicans the problem was spending specifically too much of it. The budget will put the U.S. on track to reach a $1 trillion deficit. For some fiscal conservatives who just spent years opposing President Barack Obama's deficits that's tough to swallow. Still leaders expected they could thread the needle to find the votes to pass the bill in both the House and Senate.WHERE DID THIS GO WRONG?From the beginning. The Senate had to move fast to pass the deal. But Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. a fiscal conservative and resident contrarian pumped the brakes using his objection allowed under Senate rules to delay a vote until after 1 a.m. Friday. By the time the Senate passed the deal just before 2 a.m. the government had been officially shuttered for nearly two hours. The House rushed to approve its version wrapping up the vote just after 5:30 a.m. President Donald Trump signed the bill three hours later reopening the government.The brief shutdown likely won't register for most people. Congress and the president acted in time to allow federal employees to get to work on Friday keeping disruptions to a minimum. The budget deal approved by Congress matters a lot to the Pentagon and for domestic programs for opioids health centers and research funding. The budget agreement will set spending for programs for the next two years â€” if they stick to it. Under the short-term agreement approved early Friday the government is funded for another six weeks to give lawmakers time to craft a budget plan. If they don't have something long-term in place by then the country could be in shutdown mode again in March.Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this story.Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

She was ousted from her post two days later. (Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press)Shortly before ousting Homeland Security Secretarysaid heâ€™ll take an even â€œtougherâ€ù tack on border policies that for more than two years by his own measure have failed to deter immigration.Some fear that may include a return of the reviled family separations that Trump was forced to back away from last year as well as more firings.But experts cautioned that replacing high-level personnel may not be enough to salvage an immigration policy that isnâ€™t working and has been reined in by the courts andIn the latest example of the administration's string of losses in court late Monday a federal judge in San Franciscoblocking the Trump administration policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.A U.S. judge on Monday blocked thepolicy of returning asylum seekers to Mexicas they wait for an immigration court to hear their cases but the order won't immediately go into effect.Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco granted a request by civil liberties groups to...Roughly 1000 asylum seekers have been forced to remain in Mexico since the administration announced that policy early this year. The judge gave the administration until April 12 to seek a stay from the court of appeals.takes a more prominent role in implementing an immigration policy he has largely orchestrated behind the scenes since Trump took office.In addition to urging the president to push out Nielsen Miller a long-time immigration hardliner is thought to have other administration officials in his sights.On Monday Trump made the surprise announcement thatDirector Randolph â€œTexâ€ù Alles would be replaced. Both Nielsen and Alles were closely associated with former White House Chief of Staff who resigned last year after falling out of favor with Trump.On Thursday night Trump blindsided many administration officials by abruptly withdrawing the nomination of a career official Ronald D. Vitiello to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement.â€œMillerâ€™s going to clean houseâ€ù said a former White House official calling Alles â€œKellyâ€™s best friend.â€ù The former official who did not want to be identified speaking about his one-time colleagues predicted more departures. â€œHeâ€™s firing all of Kellyâ€™s people.â€ùRELATED: 5 misconceptions about the U.S.-Mexico border Â»Nielsen Trumpâ€™s second Homeland Security secretary was pushed out largely due to frustration over a recent spike in asylum-seeking Central American families and Trumpâ€™s growing annoyance that she wouldnâ€™t take more aggressive steps.shortly after announcing her imminent departure. â€œâ€_ Will Close Southern Border If necessary...â€ùFor Trump and his closest aides â€” particularly Miller â€” the tough rhetoric is a red-meat handout to a base they see as critical to winning the White House again in 2020.At the same time the moves may be intended to mask the fact that their strategy to ramp-up immigration enforcement has failed to reduce near-record numbers of asylum seekers and families. Hemmed in by U.S. immigration law a Democratic-led House and the realities of the border critics and supporters alike wonder where the president can actually go from here.â€œStephen Miller and the administration ran out of options and resorted to eating their ownâ€ù said Blain Rethmeier who worked in President George W. Bushâ€™s White House with Nielsen. â€œLiterally absent Congress and the courts every option has been exhausted.â€ùMiller is consolidating his already considerable power over White House immigration and border security policy and proving he still very much has the presidentâ€™s ear.Much of Millerâ€™s clout comes from Trumpâ€™s familiarity with him said Corey Lewandowski a former campaign manager for Trump who still spends time with the president.â€œHeâ€™s been there obviously since January â€™16 so heâ€™s a known commodityâ€ù Lewandowski said.Tim Naftali a presidential historian at NYU raised concerns about the direction of the administration's latest moves which he argues are about more than immigration policy.â€œThis is about how we as Americans define ourselves"" Naftali said. ""He is looking for people who will implement the harshest meanest approach to immigration since the 1920s. And he'll keep cycling through people until he finds an implementer of his cruel vision.""RELATED: How border patrol chases have spun out of control with deadly consequences Â»Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies which supports less immigration to the United States agreed thereâ€™s not much more a Homeland Security secretary can do unless the White House demands more dramatic action such as setting up tent cities along the border.â€œIâ€™m just not sure that itâ€™s something a different DHS secretary can do rather than the White House making the decisionâ€ù he said.Krikorian does not believe shutting down the border will be back on the agenda any time soon given that Trump â€œmade the blusterâ€ù and then retreated.Resuming family separations may also be tricky since Trump signed an executive order to stop the practice and spoke out publicly against separations â€” and a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction to block the practice ordering the government to reunite families.For her part Nielsen made clear Monday that she wonâ€™t be abandoning her consistent support of the presidentâ€™s policies and wonâ€™t be trying to undermine him after her departure later this week.â€œI share the presidentâ€™s goal of securing the border"" Nielsen said outside her townhouse in Alexandria Va. ""I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border.â€ùNielsen had been among thmost controversial of Trumpâ€™s Cabinet secretariesgiven Trumpâ€™s mandate to push boundaries on immigration an issue that he considers central to his political standing. But her vocal defense was not enough to save her job.With Trump naming Kevin McAleenan the Customs and Border Protection commissioner as acting head of DHS the administration will soon have no CBP chief. There are also legal questions about why Trump did not follow the mandated line of succession by elevating the deputy Homeland Security secretary who is also in an acting role.In an administration already rife with record turnover the rapid personnel changes could exacerbate internal conflict at the Homeland Security department the third-largest in the federal government even as it grapples with what Nielsen and others have termed a â€œsystem-wide meltdownâ€ù in handling border security and immigration.Krikorian described a turf war between ICE and Border Patrol and questioned whether McAleenan will be nominated to permanently lead the department.â€œIs McAleenan just a placeholder?â€ù said Krikorian. â€œI just donâ€™t get the sense that heâ€™s going to bring about any kind of systemic change â€_ [DHS] Headquarters is full of people who just arenâ€™t really super enthusiastic about the presidentâ€™s broad agenda on immigration.â€ùMark Morgan a former FBI official who served as chief of Border Patrol under President Obama said White House officials â€œneed to stop expecting that Congress is going to do their jobâ€ù and reform immigration laws.â€œDHS is going to have to address this issue all aloneâ€ù he said. He said the administration should keep up the pressure on Mexico to do more to stop migrants from transiting the country to the U.S. border  increase the number of immigration judges to more quickly adjudicate cases.Morgan said he doesnâ€™t believe the White House will resume family separations but added that immediate action must be taken â€” even if it risks legal action.â€œWe have to do somethingâ€ù he said. â€œEven if we lose in the courts we still gotta do something to stop the incentive [to migrate].â€ùNo sÃ_lo delincuentes: ICE tambiÃ©n arresta a residentes permanentes legaleHallazgos de molÃ©culas orgÃ¡nicas en Marte ofrecen pistas alentadoras en la bÃºsqueda de vida en ese planetÂ¿EstarÃ¡ esta chica angelina a la altura?

"California congressman Eric Swalwell joins 2020 Democratic presidential field - Daily PresCalifornia congressman Eric Swalwell joins 2020 Democratic presidential fielFour-term Bay Area Rep. Eric Swalwell is an underdog in the crowded 2020 Democratic field. He hopes his Iowa roots will help in that early-voting state. (Alex Edelman / TNS) a four-term Bay Area congressman whoâ€™s grown into a cable TV fixture as a slashing and unremitting critic of formally announced Monday his long-shot bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination.Fittingly he chose national television as the venue to declare his intent saying on CBSâ€™ â€œLate Show withâ€ù he would â€œgo big on the issues we take on be bold in the solutions we offer and do good in the way we govern.â€ùSwalwell 38 has essentially been running for president forthe better part of the last two year. Still he will have to work to distinguish himself in a crowded field approaching 20 contestants.He is neither the youngest candidate nor the only millennial in the Democratic race â€” South Bend Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg is 37 â€” and he shares his Northern California political base with Sen. Kamala Harris a former district attorney across the bay in San Francisco.Eric Swalwell wants to be president and why the heck not? Â»His positions on major issues are shared by most other Democrats running among them support for universal healthcare higher taxes on the wealthy and a more aggressive federal effort to fight climate change.One way he plans to stand apart is making gun control a central focus of the campaign starting with his first appearance as a declared candidate at a town hall Tuesday near Parkland Fla. where 17 people were killed last year in a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High.Another distinction is his birthplace in rural Iowa where Swalwell lived until age 5 when his family moved to California. The congressman has all but taken up formal residency in the state whichcasts the first ballots of the presidential nominating process.Much of the rest of his time has been spent on the cable television airwaves where he regularly criticizes Trump and his associates. A member of the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees Swalwell has repeatedly accused the president of colluding with Russia during the 2016 election pressing his assertion even after special counselno grounds for criminal prosecution.""I stand by what I said about seeing evidence of collusionâ€ù Swalwell said on MSNBC after Atty.

Trump administration designates Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group - Daily PresTrump administration designates Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist grouVahid Salemi / Associated PresIranian Revolutionary Guard members arrive for a ceremony celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution at the Azadi or Freedom Square in Tehran on Feb. 11. (Vahid Salemi / Associated Press)In an effort to tighten political and economic pressure on Tehran the Trump administration moved Monday to brand Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization an unprecedented move against another nationâ€™s military that the Pentagon had resisted.President Trump issued the announcement from theafter months of harsh rhetoric against Iran and an onslaught of sanctions aimed at crippling its economy.In a statement Trump said the guard â€œactively participates in finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraftâ€ù and is the Iranian governmentâ€™s â€œprimary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign.â€ùâ€œThis action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequencesâ€ù Trump said.Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo said the terrorist designation will take effect in one week.Netanyahu says Trump named Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group at his request Â»Although the Revolutionary Guard plays a major role in the Iranian economy the U.S. penalties may have limited impact because the group already is under U.S. sanctions. The designation however could complicate U.S. military and diplomatic missions notably in Iraq where many Shiite Muslim militias and Iraqi political parties have close ties to the guard.U.S. military and intelligence officials have raised concerns that the designation may bar them from meeting foreign officials in contact with Revolutionary Guard personnel. Those concerns are one reason previous administrations did not make the move which was considered for more than a decade.But administration officials said Monday that exceptions would be made for U.S. personnel as needed. U.S. diplomats talk with the Taliban in Afghanistan another group listed as a foreign terrorist organization noted Nathan Sales the State Departmentâ€™s coordinator for counter-terrorism.Some military experts warned the decision could endanger U.S. troops one reason for long-standing concerns at the Pentagon.Iranian officials quickly warned of consequences for U.S. troops in the Middle East. The countryâ€™s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called for U.S. Central Command which oversees American forces in the region to be designated â€œa terrorist group under Iranian law.â€ùMohammad Ali Jafari commander of the guard warned that â€œthe American army in West Asia will see the end of tranquilityâ€ù according to the semiofficial Fars news agency.In Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing a hotly contested bid for a fourth term tweeted on the eve of the election that Trump had acted at his request.â€œThank you my dear friend the president of the United States Donald Trump for having decided to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organizationâ€ù he wrote in Hebrew on Twitter. â€œThank you for responding to another of my important requests which serves the interests of our countries and countries of the region.â€ùHe later posted a thank-you note in English that did not take credit but said of Trump: â€œOnce again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism.â€ùTrumpâ€™s move was viewed in Israel as a gift to the prime minister. Shimrit Meir a Middle East analyst tweeted that â€œthe timing of course is last-minute help from afar for pal Netanyahu.â€ùThe Trump administration has targeted what it calls Iranâ€™s malign behavior since it took office and withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord partly over those concerns. The administration cites Iranâ€™s support for militant groups in Syria Lebanon Iraq and Yemen as well as a perceived threat against Israel.This is the first U.S. designation of an entire foreign government entity although portions of the Revolutionary Guard notably its elite Quds Force have been targeted in the past.The Revolutionary Guard â€œwill take its rightful place on the same list as the terror groups it supportsâ€ù Pompeo said.The designation allows the Revolutionary Guardâ€™s assets to be frozen abroad and will complicate efforts by European and Asian companies and governments to do business with Iran. The elite military group is involved in numerous aspects of the Iranian economy.It also makes it a U.S. crime to do business with the group or provide material support for its activities.Brian Hook the administrationâ€™s special representative for Iran said the designation will deprive Iran and the Revolutionary Guard of funds needed to carry out policies that he said include assassinations and threats to U.S. military personnel.Hook said the designation will â€œmake radioactiveâ€ù any aspect of the Iranian economy that deals with the guard.â€œThe Middle East cannot be more stable and peaceful without weakeningâ€ù the Revolutionary Guard Hook said calling it the â€œblunt instrumentâ€ù of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.Behnam Ben Taleblu an Iran hawk at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington said the designation reflected the Revolutionary Guardâ€™s growing influence in Iranâ€™s â€œforeign and security policy as well as the terror apparatus.â€ùThe designation was announced a day before elections in Israel where an embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long sought the listing and has long enjoyed Trumpâ€™s support.In a tweet Zarif the Iranian foreign minister called it â€œa misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu. A(nother) dangerous U.S. misadventure in the region.â€ùAnalysts in Tehran said the designation is unlikely to change Iranâ€™s strategies or policies.Ahmad Bakhshayesh an analyst and former member of parliament said Iranâ€™s hardliners will likely be emboldened. Officials may cite the designation as evidence that any effort to resume nuclear negotiations with the U.S. would be counterproductive.The Revolutionary Guard â€œis the pillar of the Islamic Revolution inside and outside the countryâ€ù Bakhshayesh said.â€œIran will try to barter with Turkey Iraq and Russia to avoid dependency on the American dollar and other hard currencies to compensate [for] the repercussions of todayâ€™s designation.â€ùBakhshayesh predicted further devaluation of Iranâ€™s rial already buffeted by U.S. economic sanctions.The State Department designates 60 groups as foreign terrorist organizations including Al Qaeda Islamic State and their affiliates Hezbollah and numerous militant Palestinian factions. The IRGC is the first state-run military force.Wilkinson reported from Washington and Etehad from Los Angeles.

Gary Peters of Bloomfield Township.(Photo: Todd McInturf The Detroit News)â€” Two border-state senators Gary Peters of Michigan and John Cornyn of Texas want to plug aÂ shortage of nearly 4000 officers in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency asÂ theÂ number of migrant families crossing the southwest border is breaking records.Their bipartisan bill requires CBPÂ to hire no less than 600 additional officers a year until the agencyâ€™s staffing needs are met.Peters the ranking Democrat onÂ the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said he's been concerned about the understaffing for a while.TheÂ measure is ""even more critical"" Peters said after the Trump administration announced last week that as many as 2000Â Customs and Border Protection officers would beÂ voluntarily reassignedÂ to sectors across the southwest borderÂ to help with the influx of unauthorized arrivalsÂ from Central America.""As you move officers around that creates shortages and eventually thereâ€™s movement to try to readjust around the country and youâ€™re likely to see folks taken away from Michigan"" said Peters of Bloomfield Township.""Although Iâ€™m not aware of any announcement right now to do thatÂ itâ€™s safe to assume when you start moving 2000 people to specific locationsÂ that creates gaps in other places and those gaps are going to have to be filled. Theyâ€™ll either be filled with new hirees or by people being transferred from places like Michigan.""The busiest border crossing in North America is in Laredo Texas followed by two Michigan crossings: Detroit-Windsor and Port Huron-Sarnia Peters noted.""Our Customs and Border Protection officers have the important task of not only keeping us safe but also ensuring that the legitimate trade and travel our economy relies on can continue to flow swiftly through our ports"" said Cornyn a Republican.""This bill goes a long way to ensure CBP has the adequate resources staffingÂ and infrastructure they need to help keep our ports safe and running efficiently.â€ùPresident Donald Trump said Sunday that CBP CommissionerÂ Kevin McAleenan wouldreplaceÂ Kirstjen Nielsen atop the Department of Homeland Securitas acting secretary as Nielsen resigned.""Our Customs and Border Protection officers have the important task of not only keeping us safe but also ensuring that the legitimate trade and travel our economy relies on can continue to flow swiftly through our ports"" said Sen. John Cornyn a Republican.(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP)CBP has nearly 23500 officersÂ but itsÂ staffing models have shown a need for nearly 27200 leaving aÂ gap of about 3700 officers.The Peters-Cornyn bill also authorizes theÂ hiring of support staff and technicians to perform non-law enforcement functions.Peters said he'sÂ heard from Michigan port groups otherÂ stakeholders are concerned aboutÂ northern ports of entry.They worry Michigan ports of entry whether airports sea ports or border crossings could end up understaffed due to the reshuffling potentially leading to increased wait times fewerÂ health-related inspections and weaker efforts to fight trafficking and other illegal activity.â€œThe vast majority of drugs that are smuggled into this country come through legitimate ports of entry and having more CBP personnel in places like Port Huron will help us keep our communities safe and fight illegal activity like opioids trafficking"" St. Clair County Sheriff Tim Donnellon said in a statement.The bill has been endorsed byÂ the Michigan Maritime Trades CouncilÂ Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids and the Lansing Regional Airport Authority as well as the National Border Patrol CouncilÂ the American Association of Port AuthoritiesÂ and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.""The Detroit-Windsor border crossing is one of the busiest in the entire country â€” and for too long we have had to work without adequate staffing to handle the workloadâ€ù Robert Holland president of National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 173 in Detroit said in a statement.â€œTasking overworked and fatigued officers with securing our ports of entry puts the safety of all Americans at risk. Unfortunately this situation will only be exacerbated by the redeployment of officers to supplement staffing at the southern border. The first step in securing our borders is ensuring that we have the boots on the ground necessary to man our nationâ€™s ports of entry.""While the bill would authorize the hiring of 600 CBP officers money would still need to be appropriated to pay for the new hires.Peters said he's working with Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson who chairs the Homeland Security Committee to build support and hopefully move the legislation out of committee.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/peters-cornyn-bill-staffs-up-customs-border-patrol/3403034002/",0

The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects Trumpâ€™s priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.Nielsen had traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed Trumpâ€™s comments on the situation at the border though she ducked out of the room while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers Nielsen was at Trumpâ€™s side introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.But on Sunday she wrote in her resignation letter that â€œit is the right time for me to step aside.â€ù She wrote that she hoped â€œthe next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure Americaâ€™s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationâ€™s discourse.â€ùNielsen told reporters outside her Alexandria Virginia home Monday that she continues to support the presidentâ€™s goal of securing the border.â€œI will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the borderâ€ù she said in her first public remarks since the surprise resignation thanking the president â€œfor the tremendous opportunity to serve this country.â€ùNielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether sheâ€™d be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning though she was not forced to do so they said.Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination of another key immigration official the development Sunday was unexpected.Still it was unclear how McAleenan would immediately assume the role. The agencyâ€™s undersecretary of management Claire Grady is technically next in line for the job and she will need to resign â€“ or more likely be fired â€“ in order for McAleenan to assume the post.â€œThe president works very well with Kevin McAleenan. Heâ€™s done an incredible job in the administration and we expect that relationship and the work to continueâ€ù White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters Monday.He cited McAleenanâ€™s â€œextensiveâ€ù knowledge of immigration issues and said the change in leadership would hopefully lead to â€œmassive changesâ€ù at the border.Nielsen is the latest person felled in the Trump administrationâ€™s unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials brought about by the presidentâ€™s mercurial management style insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.She was also the highest profile female Cabinet member and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and even the White House staff without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary Jim Mattis was pushed out in December over criticism of the presidentâ€™s Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January following John Kellyâ€™s resignation last year.McAleenan has helped shape many of the administrationâ€™s policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders the White House and Homeland Security officials. But itâ€™s unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.Rep. Joaquin Castro chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus was critical of Nielsen saying she spent her tenure â€œchampioning President Trumpâ€™s cruel anti-immigrant agendaâ€ù and he called McAleenanâ€™s appointment â€œdeeply disturbing.â€ùâ€œHe cannot be trusted as Acting DHS Secretary based on his record of prioritizing Trumpâ€™s harmful policies that undermine national security and the economy and hurt vulnerable families and children at the borderâ€ù Castro a Texas Democrat said in a statement.Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary after her predecessor Kelly became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.Once Kelly left the White House Nielsenâ€™s days appeared to be numbered and she had expected to be pushed out last November.During the government shutdown over Trumpâ€™s insistence for funding for a border wall Nielsenâ€™s standing inside the White House appeared to rise. But in recent weeks as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign tensions flared anew.The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello â€“ a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller an immigration hardliner and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views the people said.Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday but when there was no time she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March more than half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers â€“ scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday â€“ was postponed.Nielsen dutifully pushed Trumpâ€™s immigration policies including funding for his border wall and defended the administrationâ€™s practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens â€œin the United States every day.â€ù But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.Under Nielsen migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress.

Jon Hoadley of Kalamazoo plans to challenge in 2020 longtime U.S. Rep. Fred Upton a southwest Michigan Republican.Hoadley 35 is in his third term and serves asÂ minority vice chair on the House Appropriations Committee andÂ represents Michigan House District 60 which includes Kalamazoo parts of Kalamazoo Township and Portage.""Iâ€™m running because we need to put people and community back at the center of our decisions"" Hoadley said Monday.""For too long weâ€™ve made decisions that have not been good for everyday people. Itâ€™s time that we changed that.""Upton first elected in 1986 is Michigan's senior Republican in Congress and former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. The 6th Congressional DistrictÂ includesÂ BerrienÂ CassÂ KalamazooÂ St. JosephÂ andÂ Van BurenÂ countiesÂ and most ofÂ Allegan County.U.S. Rep. Fred Upton R-St. JosepIn a statement Upton's campaign stressed the bipartisan issues he's worked on this year including the economy PFAS chemicals health care and protecting the Great Lakes.""FredÂ UptonÂ has always been focused on fighting for common-sense ideas that actually work and help southwest Michigan's families"" spokesmanÂ Josh Paciorek said.""We understand there are those excited to start politicking but right now Fredâ€™s energy and efforts are focused on solving problems.""Upton won reelection last year by 4.5 percentage points defeating Democratic political newcomerÂ Matt Longjohn of PortageÂ in his closest challenge in decades.Longjohn who won a four-way primary in August 2018Â is considering another run notingÂ that no Democrat before him had gotten within 11 percentage points of Upton.Longjohn said he's noticed a change in Upton this year highlighting his willingness to challenge President Donald Trump on his emergency declaration at the border and a vote last week to approve a gun-reform provision as part of the Violence Against Women Act.""I think we sent a message that was loud and clear. He lost St. Joseph his hometown"" Longjohn said.""Right now his votes seem to reflect that either he heard the electorate and saw heâ€™d been playing more partisan politics than people were happy with orÂ something else is happening. Maybe heâ€™s preparing for retirement. His votes have clearly changed.""Longjohn said he suspects ""plenty of people"" will be jumping into the raceÂ on the Democratic side to build on 2018Â and the infrastructure built in Michigan's 6th District.Hoadley was born and raised by two educators inÂ Vermillion South Dakota.Â He graduated in 2006 from Michigan State University majoring in social relations and women's studies.Hoadley said he owns the consulting and strategic planning businessÂ Badlands Strategies and lives in Kalamazoo with his partner Chris and their beagleÂ Benjamin.He serves on the advisory committee to the National LGBTQ Task Force on the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators and the steering committee of the American State Legislators for Gun Violence Prevention.In the Legislature he's been the primary sponsor on expanding theÂ Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to include an explicit prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.Hoadley hasÂ also focused onÂ health care including the Safe Patient Care Act on nurse-to-patient ratios and legislation to secure funding to study ways to pay for and structure long-term care in Michigan.The Michigan Republican Party issued a statement Monday suggesting Hoadleyâ€™s positions are too liberal for the values of West Michigan.â€œTax-Hike Hoadley has never seen a problem he didnâ€™t think he could tax and spend his way out of. Washingtonâ€™s tried that and it simply doesnâ€™t workâ€ù Michigan Republican Party Chairman Laura Cox said.Cox claimed that Hoadley introduced Gov. Whitmerâ€™s ""reckless"" 45-cent gas tax omcrease proposal saying it would ""devastate families across Michigan and hit southwestern Michiganâ€™s agricultural and manufacturing sectors especially hard.""Hoadley said that is not correct. As the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee Hoadley helped introduce a budget bill proposing the spending as part of the executive's recommendation.The Legislature would have to vote to raise the gas tax to generate the money in a separate bill and no lawmaker has introduced legislation to do so.""This is probably indicative of whatâ€™s to come â€”Â misinformation from my Republican friends and colleagues"" Hoagley said.Tony Zammit spokesman for the Michigan GOP said the budget that Hoadley introduced included the money that would be generated by the gas-tax increase ""therefore we stand by our statement.""""Weâ€™re having conversation about potholes in our roads because there was a half-hearted solution four years ago that didnâ€™t solve the problem and our cars our windshields our rims are dealing with that half solution today"" Hoadley said adding the same applies to school funding and the state's water crisis.""People are tired of half-baked solutions and they want us to be honest.""Hoadley said he appreciates Whitmer ""being direct and sayingÂ this is the size of the problem.""""Iâ€™m still looking at all the options on the table here.

President Donald Trump's administration is preparing to designate the Revolutionary Guard as a ""foreign terrorist organization."" It's an unprecedented move that could have widespread implications for U.S. personnel and policy in the Mideast and elsewhere. U.S. officials say an announcement is expected Monday.(Photo: Vahid Salemi / AP file)â€“ President Donald Trump announced Monday that the U.S. is designating Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Guard a â€œforeign terrorist organizationâ€ù in an effort to increase pressure on the country that could have significant diplomatic implications in the Middle East.It is the first time that the U.S. has designated a part of another government as a terrorist organization.The designation imposes sanctions that include freezes on assets the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may have in U.S. jurisdictions and a ban on Americans doing business with it.â€œThis unprecedented step led by the Department of State recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism but that the IRGC actively participates in finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraftâ€ù Trump said in a statement.Iran has threatened to retaliate for the decision.The IRGC is a paramilitary organization formed in the wake of Iranâ€™s 1979 Islamic Revolution to defend its clerically overseen government. The force answers only to Iranâ€™s supreme leader operates independently of the regular military and has vast economic interests across the country.The designation allows the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with material support or prosecute them for sanctions violations. That could include European and Asian companies and businesspeople who deal with the Guardâ€™s many affiliates.It will also complicate diplomacy. Without exclusions or waivers to the designation U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move does not allow contact with foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel. Those concerns have in part dissuaded previous administrations from taking the step which has been considered for more than a decade.The department currently designates 60 groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State and their various affiliates Hezbollah and numerous militant Palestinian factions as â€œforeign terrorist organizations.â€ù But none of them is a state-run military.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/trump-pressure-iran-branding-guard-terror-group/39315971/",0

McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well-respected by members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects Trumpâ€™s priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.â€œI have determined that it is the right time for me to step asideâ€ù Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. â€œI hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure Americaâ€™s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationâ€™s discourse.â€ùHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielse(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP)Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake-up at Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination for another key immigration post the development Sunday was unexpected.Nielsen traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed Trumpâ€™s comments on the situation at the border though she ducked out of the room without explanation for some time while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers Nielsen was at Trumpâ€™s side introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward on a Coast Guard Gulfstream as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.Nielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether sheâ€™d be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning though she was not forced to do so they said.Nielsen is the latest person felled in the Trump administrationâ€™s unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials brought about by the presidentâ€™s mercurial management style insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.Nielsen was also the highest profile female Cabinet member and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and the White House staff itself without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary Jim Mattis was pushed out in December over criticism of the presidentâ€™s Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January following John Kellyâ€™s resignation last year.Her resignation lett er lacked any sense of controversy â€“ unlike those of others who have left. She thanked Trump and DHS staff for their hard work.Her replacement McAleenan has helped shape many of the administrationâ€™s policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders the White House and Homeland Security officials. But itâ€™s unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary after her predecessor Kelly became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.Once Kelly left the White House Nielsenâ€™s days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November but her exit never materialized. During the government shutdown over Trumpâ€™s insistence for funding for a border wall Nielsenâ€™s standing inside the White House even appeared to rise.But in recent weeks as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign tensions flared anew.The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello â€“ a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller an immigration hardliner and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views the people said.Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday but when there was no time she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March over half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers â€“ scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday â€“ was postponed.Nielsen dutifully pushed Trumpâ€™s immigration policies including funding for his border wall and defended the administrationâ€™s practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens â€œin the United States every day.â€ù But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.Under Nielsen migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3000 families and facilities are at capacity.She also advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and often said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online â€“ not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2018 election.She led the federal agency since December 2017 and was this administrationâ€™s third Homeland Security secretary. A protege of Kellyâ€™s he brought her to the White House after Trump named him chief of staff. She earned a reputation as an enforcer working to corral the chaotic West Wing.Nielsen 45 previously served as a special assistant to President George W. Bush and worked for the Transportation Security Administration.She rose through the Trump ranks quickly â€“ joining the transition team after the election to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process. She quickly became a trusted aide to Kelly and the two worked together to impose order on a dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said her tenure was â€œa disaster from the start.â€ù The policies she helped create â€œhave been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.â€ùHis Senate counterpart Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis. said the government needed â€œsteady informed and effective leadership in the administration and in Congress to have any hope of fixing our out-of-control border security and immigration problems.â€ùAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.This story corrects the month in which border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry to March not this month.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/07/kirstjen-nielsen-resign/39313917/,0

Last week he voted for the Democratic candidate in a special state Senate election in Pittsburghâ€™s affluent southern suburbs.â€œA decade ago I probably wouldnâ€™t have even noticed this election was happeningâ€ù Heitman said â€œbut Iâ€™m making a point in voting in every one I can nowadays.â€ùThe Democratsâ€™ 2020 presidential primary may feature a historically diverse field of women and minorities but in some ways it is testing how the party appeals to white men such as Heitman. Many Democratic politicians went into the last presidential campaign cycle taking little account of those voters and banked on a coalition of women and minorities to carry them to victory. Trumpâ€™s victory proved that thinking wrong.Thatâ€™s left Democrats wondering whether the nominee should be someone who can cut deep into Trumpâ€™s base â€” working-class whites â€” whether itâ€™s enough to win over affluent college-educated suburban men and whether party is moving to far left to win them both.Mike Wessell center a Republican-turned Democrat talks with other supporters for democratic party candidate for Pennsylvania state senator Pam Iovino at her election returns party in Pittsburgh. Some Democrats thought they didnâ€™t need white male voters in 2016. But the party knows it needs them in 2020.(Photo: Keith Srakocic / AP)â€œThe white male vote is indispensable itâ€™s a part of any winning coalitionâ€ù said Democratic pollster Ronald Lester who worked for Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign in 2016. He noted that successful national Democrats perform well with white men and that includes Barack Obama whose strength among white men in the Rust Belt helped fuel his White House victories.Several candidates have jumped in with their own suggestions of how to do that.Former Vice President Joe Biden who hasnâ€™t said whether he is running spoke to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in an appearance Friday that seemed designed to show how he could win back white working-class voters. Biden said some of his â€œsophisticated friendsâ€ù donâ€™t understand the need to treat laborers with respect.â€œHow the hell do we get to the place where a lot of you think the rest of the country doesnâ€™t see you or know you?â€ù Biden asked the mostly male crowd.When Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio announced his campaign earlier in the week he said his more centrist approach could appeal to working-class voters like those in his district which embodies the Rust Belt terrain that Trump won.Sen. Amy Klobuchar D-Minn. said her no-frills style has delivered white Midwestern voters before. Former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke D-Texas uses his star appeal that helped him in Texasâ€™ well-educated suburbs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has said his economic populism will bring rural white voters back to the Democratic fold.Polling makes clear why Democratic are searching for the right messenger.White men make up typically make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018 41 percent of them voted for Democrats according to AP VoteCast a survey of the national electorate. While Democratsâ€™ strength among women won headlines and was often credited with the Democratsâ€™ strong showing white men also moved to the Democrats. VoteCast showed Democrats won the votes of 46 percent of white male college graduates a figure thatâ€™s buoyed some in the party.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/07/democrats-white-male-voters/39314679/,0

Richard Neal asked the IRS to provide six years of Trumpâ€™s personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses.â€œThat is not going to happen and they know itâ€ù Mulvaney told â€œFox News Sunday.â€ù Asked whether he believes Democrats would ever view the presidentâ€™s returns Mulvaney replied: â€œOh no never. Nor should they.â€ùLast week Massachusetts Democrat Neal one of only three congressional officials authorized to request tax returns requested Trumpâ€™s personal and business returns in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. He asked for returns covering 2013 through 2018. He also asked for the documents in seven days setting an April 10 deadline.An obscure 1924 statute includes no exceptions to Nealâ€™s authority to ask the Treasury Department for returns and says the department â€œshall furnishâ€ù them when requested. It does require that the review of an individualâ€™s return be conducted by members of Congress in â€œclosed executive sessionâ€ù if the returns are provided without the taxpayerâ€™s consent.Still Mulvaney claimed the law provides for lawmakers to review individual tax returns but â€œpolitical hit job is not one of those reasons.â€ù His comments echoed those made by Trumpâ€™s lawyers who argued the Democratic request â€œwould set a dangerous precedentâ€ù if granted.Trump broke with precedent when he chose not to release any tax returns as a presidential candidate. Mulvaney tried to cast the issue of the presidentâ€™s taxes as old news saying it was â€œalready litigated during the electionâ€ù and the American people â€œelected him anyway.â€ùTrump has said he wonâ€™t release the information because he is under audit something he reiterated again Friday while visiting the U.S-Mexico border.â€œIâ€™m under audit. When youâ€™re under audit you donâ€™t do itâ€ù Trump said.IRS officials have said taxpayers under audit are free to release their returns. Trump claimed at a news conference following his election in November 2018 that the filings are too complex for people to understand.William Consovoy whose firm was retained by Trump to represent him on the matter said in a letter Friday to the Department of Treasuryâ€™s general counsel that the tax code zealously guards taxpayer privacy. He said requests for tax returns â€œmust have a legitimate legislative purpose.â€ùNeal has said he made the request to review the IRS policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents saying â€œlittle is known about the effectiveness of this program.â€ùâ€œOn behalf of the American people the Ways and Means Committee must determine if that policy is being followed and if so whether these audits are conducted fully and appropriatelyâ€ù Neal said when unveiling his request for Trumpâ€™s returns.Utah Sen.

Letâ€™s go so we can win everything.â€ùJewish voters in the U.S. have traditionally sided heavily with Democrats â€“ and are often ideologically liberal â€“ but Republicans are hoping to narrow the gap next year in part as Trump cites actions that he says demonstrate support for Israel.Trump earned standing ovations for recounting both the embassy move and the Golan Heights recognition.Trump noted it had long been a priority for Adelson and his wife Miriam. â€œThat is the most important thing thatâ€™s ever happened in their lifeâ€ù Trump said. â€œThey love Israel.â€ùTrumpâ€™s speech comes weeks after he suggested Democrats â€œhateâ€ù Jews. His remark followed an internal fight among Democrats over how to respond to comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. that some criticized as anti-Semitic.Trump mockingly thanked Omar as he began his speech before adding â€œOh I forgot. She doesnâ€™t like Israel I forgot Iâ€™m sorry. No she doesnâ€™t like Israel does she? Please I apologize.â€ùHe also accused Democrats of allowing anti-Semitism to â€œtake rootâ€ù in their party.Before Trumpâ€™s appearance people assembled for the event carried signs with â€œWe are Jews for Trumpâ€ù and â€œTrumpâ€ù written in Hebrew. Dozens of men and several women wore red yarmulkes with â€œTrumpâ€ù in white that were distributed at the event.Trump also took credit for eliminating hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians and for pulling the U.S. out of several U.N. organizations the U.N. Human Rights Council and UNESCO citing anti-Israel bias in their agendas.Trump criticized some 2020 Democrats who have suggesting they would re-enter the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew the United States. The agreement was fiercely opposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has cheered as Trump re-imposed stringent new sanctions on the country that Israel regards as an existential threat. Trump is closely aligned with Netanayu whoâ€™s seeking to return power in Tuesdayâ€™s national election.Trump predicted that election is â€œgonna be closeâ€ù adding it features â€œTwo good peopleâ€ù seemingly referring to Netanyahu and his chief threat to Netanyahuâ€™s coalition former Israeli army chief of staff Benny Gantz.Despite his criticism of Democrats Trump has faced his own criticism from the Jewish community. Trump was slow to condemn white supremacists who marched violently in Charlottesville Virginia in 2017. The previous year he circulated an image of a six-pointed star alongside a photo of Hillary Clinton a pile of money and the words â€œmost corrupt candidate ever.â€ùPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual leadership meeting Saturday April 6 2019 in Las Vegas.When he addressed the RJC in 2015 he said he didnâ€™t expect to earn their support because he wouldnâ€™t take their money. â€œYou want to control your politicians thatâ€™s fineâ€ù Trump said at the time. Ultimately the group and many of its donors backed Trump.Trump met privately with Adelson before speaking according to an official. Adelson has cancer and has been in poor health but he and his wife attended Trumpâ€™s remarks â€“ receiving a standing ovation when they entered the ballroom.The Adelsons gave Trumpâ€™s campaign $30 million in 2016. They followed that by contributing $100 million to the Republican Party for the 2018 midterm elections.Introducing Trump former Sen. Norm Coleman R-Minn. the chairman of the RJC led the audience in an adapted version of the Passover reading â€œDayenuâ€ù as he recounted what Trump had done for Israel.Stuart Weil a Jewish man from Fresno California said Americans have traditionally been very supportive of Israel but â€œthe progressive liberal wing of the Democratic Partyâ€ù is changing that.Weil who wore a blue Trump-style hat that read â€œMaking Israel &amp; America Great Againâ€ù says heâ€™s a Republican because of the partyâ€™s strong stance on Israel.According to AP Votecast a survey of more than 115000 midterm voters and 3500 Jewish voters nationwide voters who identified as Jewish broke for Democrats over Republicans by a wide margin 72 percent to 26 percent in 2016.Over the past decade Jewish voters have shown stability in their partisanship according to data from Pew Research Center. Jewish voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a roughly 2-1 ratio.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/06/trump-israel-jewish-supporters/39309965/",0

I think they really slowed us downâ€ù President Donald Trump told reporters Friday.(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP)President Donald Trump called on the Federal Reserve to open the monetary floodgates to turn the worldâ€™s largest economy into a â€œrocket ship.â€ùâ€œI personally think the Fed should drop rates. I think they really slowed us down. Thereâ€™s no inflation. I would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easingâ€ù he told reporters as he departed the White House on Friday. â€œYou would see a rocket ship. Despite that weâ€™re doing very well.â€ùThe request for Fed assistance to boost growth came just after a Labor Department report showed another healthy sign for the durability of an expansion that may become the longest on record by midyear. The jobless rate held near a 49-year low and employers added more workers than economists forecast in March. The report showed little sign of wage inflation.Trump is breaking with longstanding Republican criticism of the Fedâ€™s large balance sheet and embracing a loose monetary policy that in effect helps finance the nationâ€™s debt load. He repeatedly criticized the Fed under President Barack Obama for holding down interest rates and the use of quantitative easing which at the time was an effort to lower long-term borrowing costs by buying Treasury bonds and mortgage securities.Stocks gained after Trumpâ€™s remarks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just posted its biggest quarterly advance in almost a decade. A segment of the Treasuries yield curve the difference between 3-month and 10-year rates narrowed Friday though traders say that move began after the March jobs data was released. The gap was at around 7.5 basis points from 8.7 basis points Thursday. The spread inverted last month for the first time since 2007.â€œWe donâ€™t even know what to make of Trumpâ€™s commentâ€ù said Ian Lyngen head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.Trump has regularly called for rate cuts but his advice on the balance sheet went further into a debate thatâ€™s mostly been among economists and investment professionals.In the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago the Fed bought government bonds and mortgage-backed securities in a strategy called quantitative easing aimed at lowering longer-term market rates after cutting its main policy rate close to zero. That swelled the Fed balance sheet to a peak of $4.52 trillion in early 2015.As the economy strengthened in recent years the central bank has allowed the securities to mature without reinvesting proceeds which some call â€œquantitative tightening.â€ù The balance sheet tally recently was $3.94 trillion.Central bankers in March held the benchmark lending rate in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent and said they would start slowing balance-sheet shrinkage in May and halt the draw-down altogether at the end of the September. Their forecasts showed they plan to hold their policy rate unchanged this year.In another effort to influence Fed policy Trump plans to nominate two political loyalists for the Fedâ€™s board of governors: former Godfatherâ€™s Pizza Inc. CEO Herman Cain and Stephen Moore a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Their qualifications for the board have been questioned by economists and many lawmakers and neither has been formally nominated.Trumpâ€™s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the appointments arenâ€™t intended to undermine the Fedâ€™s traditional political independence. â€œWe are not going after their independenceâ€ù Kudlow said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. â€œWe have our point of view.â€ùFed rate increases last year drew criticism from the president who even discussed firing Chairman Jerome Powell.Kudlow observed that inflation is low even as wages rise. â€œWhy raise interest rates?â€ùRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2019/04/06/trump-fed-economy/39307717/,0

Friday April 5 2019. Trump headed to the border with Mexico to make a renewed push for border security as a central campaign issue for his 2020 re-election.(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP)â€“ Giving himself credit for tough diplomacy President Donald Trump is describing a burst of activity by Mexican authorities to keep Central American migrants from getting to the U.S. border.Thatâ€™s an apparent mirage as Trump retreats from his latest threat to seal off the U.S. from Mexico.Trump was wrong when he said last week that Mexico was doing â€œNOTHINGâ€ù about migrants coming north. It markedly tightened migration controls during the Obama administration and detained over 30000 foreigners in the first three months of this year.And itâ€™s not evident now that Mexico has suddenly cracked down as a result of his threat â€œapprehending everybodyâ€ù and making â€œabsolutely terrific progressâ€ù in just a matter of days as Trump put it. Mexicoâ€™s apprehensions of foreigners have not surged.TRUMP on why he is pulling back on sealing the border imminently: â€œBecause Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days. Theyâ€™re apprehending everybody. Yesterday they apprehended 1400 people. The day before was 1000. And if they apprehend people at their southern border where they donâ€™t have to walk through thatâ€™s a big home run. We can handle it from there. Itâ€™s really good. â€_ Mexico for the last four days itâ€™s never happened like that in 35 years.â€ù â€“remarks to reporters Friday.TRUMP: â€œMexico has brought people back theyâ€™ve told people you canâ€™t come in. And thatâ€™s happened really theyâ€™ve done as I understand it over 1000 today over 1000 people yesterday over 1000 people the day before that. Before that they never did anything.â€ù â€“ remarks to reporters Thursday.THE FACTS: This depiction of Mexico going from strikeout to home run is inaccurate at both ends.Mexico reports that its interception and detention of migrants from the south are â€œabout averageâ€ù in recent months. Over the first three days of April it apprehended 1259 foreigners â€“ not 1000 or more a day as Trump claimed.â€œThere is no very substantive changeâ€ù Mexicoâ€™s foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said this week. â€œThere has not been a drastic change.â€ùâ€œI donâ€™t know what (Trump) was referring toâ€ù he added.Mexico is requiring migrants to register with authorities but thatâ€™s been the case since Lopez Obrador took office Dec. 1 Ebrard said. â€œWhat Mexico is doing as far as the review of the southern border â€“ well itâ€™s the same thing it has been doing since this government began.â€ù On Thursday Mexicoâ€™s ambassador to the U.S. Martha Barcena told The Associated Press her country is working to make its own border â€œmore orderlyâ€ù but â€œmigration will never be stopped.â€ùMexico took a substantial step in 2014 implementing a â€œSouthern Border Planâ€ù that established checkpoints and raids to discourage migrants from riding trains or buses from Guatemala. Its detention of foreigners almost all Central Americans surged to 198141 over the next year from 127149. Last year it detained 138612.The White House has refused to substantiate Trumpâ€™s claim about Mexicoâ€™s migrant apprehensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday credited Mexico with the â€œwillâ€ù to help stem migration but he did not cite results. Even as Trump claimed a Mexican crackdown Pompeo said the U.S. needs to see action from Mexico telling Fox News that itâ€™s â€œone thing to talk about it.â€ùTrump has abandoned his vow to shut the border imminently. He now says that if Mexico does not continue cooperating on migrants he will try to put heavy duties on autos from Mexico and revive his border-closure threat if that doesnâ€™t work.Stevenson reported from Mexico City.

But talking to reporters after addressing members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Biden said he was proud of his own early support for gay marriage and other liberal stands.â€œThe vast majority of the members of the Democratic party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional senseâ€ù Biden said. As to where he falls on ideological lines Biden added: â€œIâ€™m an Obama-Biden Democrat man. And Iâ€™m proud of it.â€ùStill signs of shifts in feelings in the party have been evident in recent complaints about Bidenâ€™s history of publicly affectionate behavior with women. Nevada politician Lucy Flores said she was uncomfortable when Biden kissed her on the back of the head backstage at a 2014 campaign event. Her account was countered by scores of women â€“ from prominent lawmakers to former staffers â€“ who praised him as a warm affectionate person and a supportive boss. But several other women have also come forward to recount their own awkward interactions with him.Biden kicked off his speech making light of the controversy after embracing the IBEWâ€™s male president Lonnie Stephenson. â€œI just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnieâ€ù Biden joked to the largely male audience which responded with cheers.Afterward he spoke with reporters about the recent controversy.â€œIâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t understand more. Iâ€™m not sorry for any of my intentions. Iâ€™m not sorry for anything Iâ€™ve ever done â€“ Iâ€™ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.â€ùFlores wasnâ€™t impressed. She tweeted: â€œTo make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have.â€ùFormer Vice President Joe Biden is greeted by International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers President Lonnie Stephenson as he arrives to speak at IBEW's construction and maintenance conference in Washington Friday April 5 2019.(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP)Biden did say the controversy â€œis going to have to change somewhat how I campaign.â€ù Though he hasnâ€™t formally announced Biden on Friday made clear heâ€™s expecting to run again for president saying lawyers warned him he needs to speak carefully about his intentions but that he expects to â€œbe standing before you all relatively soon.â€ùBidenâ€™s address seemed intended to highlight how he could win back white blue-collar workers like those who supported Donald Trump in 2016. Biden seemed to criticize his own party for walking away from the demographic in a nostalgia-drenched 40-minute address.Biden recounted a time when he said the dignity of teachers sanitation and electrical line workers was treasured and the nation felt it had a common purpose. Saying his father a salesman told him to respect everyone Biden alluded to various â€œsophisticated friendsâ€ù who donâ€™t get the significance of treating blue-collar laborers as equals.â€œAll youâ€™re looking for is to be treated fairly with respect with some dignityâ€ù Biden said. â€œBecause you matter.â€ùBiden also noted heâ€™d gotten criticism from the left for saying Democrats had to work with Republicans to get things done and in defending President Obamaâ€™s signature law the Affordable Care Act which some Democratic presidential aspirants want to replace with a single-payer system.â€œWe need to build on itâ€ù Biden said of the law. â€œWhat we canâ€™t do is blow it up.â€ùShortly after Biden was finished speaking Trump hit back. â€œIâ€™ve employed thousands of Electrical Workersâ€ù the president tweeted as his plane flew toward the Mexican border with California. â€œThey will be voting for me!â€ùThe IBEW endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.Friday was the second time in two days the president attacked Biden on Twitter. Despite more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct on Thursday the president posted a doctored version of a cellphone video Biden released addressing the controversy over his touching. In Trumpâ€™s version a Biden avatar approaches Biden from behind and appears to grab his shoulders.Trump has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct and on Friday he told reporters he saw no reason to avoid going after Biden on the issue. â€œYeah I think Iâ€™m a very good messenger and people got a kick out of itâ€ù Trump said.Riccardi reported from Denver.

President Donald Trump is visiting Calexico on Friday April 5 2019 to tour the recently-built portion of the border fence that bears a silver plaque with his name on it.(Photo: Gregory Bull / AP file)â€“ The White House has touted a two-mile stretch of fencing President Donald Trump is visiting Friday as the first section of his proposed border wall to be built.In reality the newly fortified structure commemorated with a plaque bearing his name and those of top immigration and homeland security officials was a long-planned replacement for an old barrier.It is one of a handful of projects that total $1 billion to replace existing barriers and build new ones across the border.As Trump touts his signature campaign promise as the solution to the recent surge of migrant families crossing the border here are questions and answers about the various barriers along the border and those that are in the works.The southern border is nearly 2000 miles long and already has about 650 miles of different types of barriers including short vehicle barricades and tall steel fences that go up to 30 feet high. Most of the fencing was built during the administration of George W. Bush and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.Trump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border. His administration has only replaced existing fencing including the section he is touring Friday.Construction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date back to 2009 during the beginning of former President Barack Obamaâ€™s tenure.Contractors have been doing site and preparation work for 13 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley that will be Trumpâ€™s first new fencing. The administration said construction could begin as early as this week. The administration is also in the process of replacing 14 miles of fencing around San Diego.â€œThe wall is under construction by the way large sections. Weâ€™re going to be meeting I think on Friday at a piece of the wall that weâ€™ve completed a big piece a lot of itâ€™s being built right nowâ€ù he told reporters Thursday. â€œItâ€™s moving along very nicely. But we need the wall.â€ùIn this Feb. 5 2019 file photo a Border Patrol agent walks towards prototypes for a border wall in San Diego. The prototypes were taken down in February.(Photo: Gregory Bull / AP file)Early in his term Trump called for prototypes of border walls that were built in the San Diego area at a cost of about $300000 to $500000 each. Eight prototypes went up and Trump traveled to the border to inspect them last year.But they were demolished in February. The nearly $3 billion that Congress provided for barriers during the first half of Trumpâ€™s term requires the money be spent on designs that were in place before May 2017 which meant the prototypes couldnâ€™t be used.The prototypes became a spectacle at various times since Trump took office drawing tourists protesters and artists who projected light shows on the walls from Mexico.What about the national emergency?Trump shut down the federal government for more than a month â€“ the longest shutdown in U.S. history â€“ and later declared a national emergency to free up billions of dollars to build his wall. Congress had voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed the measure.Several organizations brought lawsuits over the declaration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats also planned on suing to prevent Trump from â€œstealingâ€ù money from federal programs and diverting the money to build a wall.But the national emergency money has not yet been spent in part because the government has to first spend existing border wall funding. A lawsuit could eventually derail the plan.Still various plans for more border barriers are moving along.In this Jan. 22 2019 file photo workers place sections of metal wall as a new barrier is built along the Texas-Mexico border near downtown El Paso.(Photo: Eric Gay / AP file)Last month the Department of Homeland Security requested that the defense department build 57 miles of 18-foot fencing near Yuma Arizona and El Paso Texas which have seen enormous increases in the number of border crossers especially families.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/05/look-state-wall-us-mexico-border/39304821/,0

Security Council. The U.S. has never been a member of the ICC a court of last resort that prosecutes grave crimes only when other nations are unwilling or unable to bring suspects to justice.Bensouda is expected to brief the Security Council next month on her investigations in Libya.The State Department confirmed the measure.â€œIn this case where Prosecutor Bensouda has publicly stated that her visa has been revoked we confirm that the Prosecutorâ€™s visa to the United States has been revokedâ€ù the department said in a statement.It declined to discuss other cases but said that â€œthe United States will take the necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and to protect our people from unjust investigation and prosecution by the International Criminal Court.â€ùU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that Washington would revoke or deny visas to ICC staff seeking to investigate alleged war crimes and other abuses committed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan or elsewhere and may do the same with those who seek action against Israel.The ICC prosecutor has a pending request to look into possible war crimes in Afghanistan that may involve Americans. The Palestinians have also asked the court to bring cases against Israel.Pompeo said in March that his move was necessary to prevent the court from infringing on U.S. sovereignty by prosecuting American forces or allies for torture or other war crimes.Bensouda asked last year to open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces Taliban and Haqqani network militants as well as U.S. forces and intelligence officials in Afghanistan since May 2003.The request says there is information that members of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies â€œcommitted acts of torture cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations principally in the 2003-2004 period.â€ùThe United States has never been a member of the Hague-based court even though the Clinton administration in 2000 signed the Rome Statute that created it. However he had reservations about the scope of the courtâ€™s jurisdiction and never submitted it for ratification to the Senate.When President George W. Bush took office in 2001 his administration passed the American Service Members Protection Act which sought to immunize U.S. troops from potential prosecution by the ICC. In 2002 U.S. national security adviser John Bolton then a State Department official traveled to New York to ceremonially â€œunsignâ€ù the Rome Statute at the United Nations.In a speech to the American Society of International Law late last month ICC President Chile Eboe-Osuji paid tribute to American involvement in previous international courts from the post-World War II trials of Nazis in Nuremberg to U.N. tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.He urged Washington to support the ICC â€œwhose values and objectives are entirely consistent with the best instincts of America and her values.â€ùAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington D.C. contributed to this report.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

He added that the law on releasing tax returns is â€œ100 percent on my side.â€ùTrump has long insisted that the reason he wonâ€™t voluntarily release his tax returns is because he is under audit by the IRS. No law bars a filer from releasing tax returns that are being audited. Sitting presidents and vice presidents are annually audited by the IRS but Trump claimed he was under audit for years before he was elected.House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal asked the IRS on Wednesday to release six yearsâ€™ worth of Trumpâ€™s personal and business tax returns citing a 1924 law that gives Neal along with the other heads of the congressional tax committees the authority to request the tax return of any filer. The law says the Treasury Secretary â€œshallâ€ù hand over those documents upon request.Trumpâ€™s comments signal he is ready to engage in a long legal battle with Democrats to protect his tax information. The IRS and Treasury Department have not yet said how they will respond to Nealâ€™s request.

The move comes as his administration tries to deal with a 12-year high in U.S.-Mexico crossings straining the U.S. immigration system and leading Trump to threaten to close the border before backing off.The Associated Press reported earlier that a notice was sent to members of Congress on Thursday withdrawing Ron Vitielloâ€™s nomination to lead the agency. But the decision was unexpected and met with confusion.Vitiello was scheduled to travel with Trump to Calexico California on Friday and some of his aides thought he was still going to that border town even after the paperwork was sent. One Homeland Security official insisted it was nothing but a paperwork error that later was corrected.Trump said Friday before he left Washington that Vitiello was a â€œgood manâ€ù but â€œweâ€™re going in a tougher direction.â€ù Trump did not explain what that meant and did not say who he had in mind as a replacement.The job requires Senate confirmation. Vitiello had cleared one committee and a second committee was consideration his nomination. Vitiello has been acting head since last June of the agency that enforces U.S. immigration law in the interior of the United States. He has more than 30 years in law enforcement starting in 1985 with the U.S. Border Patrol. He was previously Border Patrol chief and deputy commissioner U.S. Customs and Border Protection which oversees the patrol.Vitiello took over during a time of heightened scrutiny of the agency. Part of its mission is to arrest immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and that has made the agency a symbol of Trumpâ€™s hard-line policies.Trump has railed anew recently against increasing border crossings as well as the release of thousands of migrants into the U.S. because of a lack of space to hold them a move he derides as â€œcatch and release.â€ùItâ€™s a battle cry on a signature issue for the president who wants to restrict immigration but whose policies have largely failed to do so.For many years families arriving at the border were typically released from U.S. custody immediately and allowed to settle with family or friends in the U.S. while their immigration cases wound their way through the courts a process that often takes years.But in recent months the number of families crossing into the U.S. has climbed to record highs pushing the system to the breaking point. As a result ICE was releasing families faster in greater numbers and at points farther removed from the border. Since Dec. 21 the agency set free more than 125000 people who came into the U.S. as families.Trump on Friday was to tour a recently built portion of fence that he is holding up as the answer to stop a surge of migrant families coming to the U.S. in recent months.The White House says itâ€™s the first section of his proposed border wall to be built commemorated with a plaque bearing his name and those of top immigration and homeland security officials â€“ but not Vitielloâ€™s.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Trump says heâ€™ll be skipping this yearâ€™s annual White House Correspondentsâ€™ Association dinner again and holding a rally instead.(Photo: Evan Vucci / AP)â€“ No thanks. President Donald Trump says heâ€™s got better things to do than attend the â€œboringâ€ù and â€œnegativeâ€ù White House Correspondentsâ€™ Association dinner.Trump said Friday heâ€™ll hold one of his signature political rallies as counter-programming to the glitzy April 27 press dinner skipping the event for the third year in a row.â€œThe dinner is so boring and so negative that weâ€™re going to hold a very positive rally insteadâ€ù he said.Presidents and first ladies have traditionally attended the event a fundraiser for college scholarships where politicians journalists and celebrities mix. A number of reporting awards also are distributed at the dinner.Trump has not attended the dinner since he took office but had suggested he might appear this year after organizers scrapped the usual format featuring a comedian and instead invited Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow to speak.Association President Olivier Knox said in a statement: â€œWeâ€™re looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past present and future.â€ùTrump who has long had an adversarial relationship with the news media also held rallies on the same night as the dinner in 2017 and 2018. Throughout his presidency he has criticized the â€œfake mediaâ€ù and â€œdishonestâ€ù reporters singling out specific journalists and news outlets.True to form Trump tweeted Friday that the press â€œcanâ€™t stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs.â€ùHe added: â€œThey are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!â€ùTrump said his team has yet to settle on a location for his April 27 rally but stressed: â€œItâ€™ll be a big one.â€ùThe association decided to shift to a featured speaker instead of a comic after a sharply anti-Trump performance last year by comedian Michelle Wolf that some thought was too pointed against White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other White House staff.Chernow a biographer of presidents and statesmen including George Washington and Alexander Hamilton is expected to speak about the importance of the First Amendment. Chernow like many of his fellow historians strongly opposed Trumpâ€™s candidacy in 2016 and labeled him a â€œdemagogue.â€ùWhile Trump has not attended the dinner as president he has gone in the past. He was famously mocked by President Barack Obama at the 2011 dinner.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/05/trump-skip-negative-correspondents-dinner/39304045/,0

Other female colleagues have since defendedÂ his leadership.In a statement to The Detroit News Studley this week criticized the outside investigation as doing â€œthe bare minimumâ€ù to avoid legal liability and failing to fix the problem. The Michigan Legislature is not subject to public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act.â€œThe Senate Democratic staff suffers from a culture where smart outspoken women are dismissed excluded and underminedâ€ù Studley said in the Feb. 3 2017 complaint alleging she was â€œsystematicallyâ€ù excluded from strategy discussions and denied a promotion promised under Mulcroneâ€™s predecessor.â€œI believe I am being treated this way because I am a womanâ€ù Studley wrote.The NewsÂ has learned that a second staffer former Ananich press secretary Angela Wittrock also filed two discrimination complaints shortly before quitting in 2016. One was a gender discrimination claim against colleague Michael Zukas and another against a female superior current Communications Director Lisa Keith.Wittrock who confirmed she filed the complaints but declined additional commentÂ said in one accompanying narrative that she had brought hostileÂ workplace concerns to Mulcrone who told herÂ she needed to just â€œlearn to eat a little s---.â€ùSarah Studley former legal counsel and senior policy adviser for Senate Democrats filed a discriminatory harassment complaint in FebruaryÂ 2016 against John Mulcrone who remains chief of staff to Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich D-Flint.(Photo: John Mulcrone's Twitter site)She was one of three women who left their jobs with Senate Democrats that year prior to the complaint from Studley who cited the turnover as evidence of wider problems and officially left her own post in July 2017.The complaints were filed with the Senate Business Office which oversees human resources for both political party caucuses. The business office then hired outside counsel to investigate allegations after Studleyâ€™s complaint said Amber McCann a spokeswoman for majority Senate Republicans.â€œAnd the investigations concluded the complaints had no meritâ€ù McCann said telling The News that the probe included interviews with â€œmultiple parties.â€ùAnanich said in a statement he values a â€œsafe productive work environmentâ€ù and takes â€œseriously any complaint of discrimination or harassment.â€ùâ€œI referred this matter to the non-partisan Senate Business Office when it came to my attention and they hired independent counsel to thoroughly investigate the complaintâ€ù he said. â€œI was prepared to act in accordance with whatever the investigation found and they ultimately found that there was no evidence of gender-based discrimination.â€ùSenate Minority Leader Jim Ananich said in a statement he values a â€œsafe productive work environmentâ€ù and takes â€œseriously any complaint of discrimination or harassment.â€ùBut the depth of that investigation is unknown and Studley criticized it.""Too often when women and minorities sound the alarm about discriminatory demeaning treatment in the workplace they end up getting forced out and nothing gets fixedâ€ù Studley told The News.â€œEmployers should focus on doing the right thing and addressing the problems rather than doing the bare minimum to avoid being sued.""The Senate paid $7500 for the investigation which was conducted by Evans Law Group P.C. of Rochester according to Business Office Director Jordan Hankwitz.The Senate typically does not comment on personnel issues because â€œwe would always want to protect their privacyâ€ù McCann said â€œbut this has been outside the normal circumstances of any personnel issue as there is more information out in the public than we would expect.â€ùDeputy Chief of Staff Nancy Green who previously worked with Mulcrone under former leaders and rejoined Senate Democrats in September 2017 defended her boss and longtime colleague.â€œHeâ€™s always been fairâ€ù she said.Â â€œHeâ€™s the kind of supervisor and frankly the kind of employee who tries to help other employees. Heâ€™s always lifted people up and given people opportunities.â€ùGreen noted that sheâ€™s earned a promotion a pay increase and been given additional responsibilities working under Mulcrone during the past two years. She is one of several women who currently holdâ€œI donâ€™t have anything negative to say about him and Iâ€™m frankly surprised to see other people criticize him.â€ùIn her complaint Studley indicated she had brought general concerns about workplace conditions to Ananich on multiple occasions including a Sept. 9 2016 discussion and a phone chat and subsequent email later that same month.She also alleged Zukas another male staffer who was the subject of a separate complaint from Wittrock had a â€œhistory of making sexist remarks and provokingâ€ù female colleagues but was only reprimanded when he made â€œracially insensitive comments not sexist ones.â€ùThe 2017 discrimination complaint and material allegations wereÂ made public by Chris Savage chairman of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party who published Studleyâ€™s complaint on his Eclectablog website.â€œI donâ€™t like to do friendly fire but we have to be better than thisâ€ù Savage told The News on Wednesday suggesting Democratic efforts to regain a majority in the upper chamber â€œdonâ€™t stand a chanceâ€ù if talented female staffers leave because of poor treatment by male superiors.Savage cast doubt on the thoroughness of the Senate Business Office investigation that found the claims without merit.â€œMy hope is this spurs a change and this is largely going to have to be on Jim Ananichâ€ù Savage said. â€œHeâ€™s the boss of it. People tell me heâ€™s a super nice guy but very conflict averse and that seems to be showing itself right now.â€ùGreen praised Ananich and questioned why the complaint wasÂ published since the investigation had found no fault.""I feel like they're all about lifting people up and helping people do their best"" she said aboutÂ Mulcrone and Ananich.

Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas second from right listen at a news conference after the House voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act Thursday on Capitol Hill in Washington.â€” In an unusual display several Republican lawmakers shouted down Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell on Thursday as she spoke on the House floor about reauthorizingÂ the Violence Against Women Act.The National Rifle Association hadurged lawmakers to vote against the biloverÂ a gun-reform provision by Dingell to include convicted stalkers and convicted abusers of current or former dating partners among thoseÂ prohibited from purchasing or owning firearms.""DoÂ not let the NRA bully you!"" Dingell said directing her remarks to the GOP side of the chamber and raising the memory of her husband former Rep. John Dingell Jr. who died in February.""Don't forget who I was married to. John Dingell was on the NRA board. Hell he helped start it.""All this does â€” we are not taking away due process. All we are saying is if someone has been convicted (of abusing) an intimate partner then they would not have access to a gun. If someone has been convicted of stalking. I would say to all of you â€”""As the Dearborn Democrat spoke a rising chorus of male members on the GOP side shouted that Dingell's time to speak was up interrupting the remainder of her remarks.Her allotted time had expired but Dingell kept trying to speak over the warnings of the chair.""You know what? You can't shout down a woman"" Dingell retorted.-- speaking on behalf of Violence Against Women Act reauthorization -- urges members to ""not let the NRA bully you"" Republicans shout her down.""You know what? You can't shout down a woman!"" she says.She was speaking against a Republican procedural motion toÂ substitute the underlying legislation with an extension of the current Violence Against Women Act excludingÂ  Dingell's provision and other updates.Rep. Elise Stefanik R-New York contended that only a ""clean"" extension of the law would pass muster in the Republican-controlled Senate.""This extension gives Republicans and Democrats time to work together to pass a truly bipartisan long-term reauthorization of VAWA just like Congress has done many times before"" Stefanik said.The Democrats' legislationÂ ""politicizes"" VAWA and ""could put women girls and children at potential risk in the future"" she said.""Voting no on this motion to recommit means you are voting to end the Violence Against Women Act and instead knowingly voting for a partisan bill that will never see the light of day in the Senate"" Stefanik said to her colleagues' applause.""It will collect dust in the Senate"" she added.But Dingell argued the GOPÂ extension was too short ""incomplete"" and threatened to undermine the statute noting it left out rape-testing funds and anti-child abuse training.The House ultimately rejected the Republican motion and voted 263-158 to pass the reauthorization including Dingell's measure with 33 Republicans joining Democrats in support.Before she was shouted down Dingell delivered an emotional speech on the House floor referring to her own experience with domestic violence growing up.""I remember what it was like when you called the police and they didn't come because your father was an important man in town. I remember what it was like when someone on our college campus was raped and the police came to them and said 'It's your fault' and would do nothing"" Dingell said.""And I don't want anyone in this House to forget that Michigan State UniversityÂ was only brought to the forefront last year whenÂ hundreds of victims tried to tell people something was happening and nobody would listen. We cannot go back to those days.""Dingell said after the vote that she would fight to pass the legislation in the Senate.""I was in the moment. And in case you couldn't tell I spoke from my heart"" she said.""Preventing domestic violence and sexual assault against women should never be politicized"" Rep. Jack Bergman R-Watersmeet said in a statement.(Photo: John L. Russell / Special to The Detroit News)Rep. Jack Bergman R-Watersmeet agreed with Stefanik saying Democrats had ""sabotaged"" the reauthorization.""Preventing domestic violence and sexual assault against women should never be politicized"" Bergman said in a statement.""Iâ€™m disappointed that instead of a clean authorization bill Democratic leadership chose to add provisions to this bill that would deny due process and fail to offer necessary protections to victims of domestic violence.""Rep. Fred Upton of St. Joseph was the only Michigan Republican to vote for the bill.""The big change here is thatÂ folks thatÂ are convicted or plead guiltyÂ to stalking domestic assault you know a number of different thingsÂ areÂ viewed is not law abidingÂ and therefore they lose that right"" to firearms. I don't have a problem with that"" said Upton who also supports universal background checks.""ThereÂ are a lot of crimesÂ committed against the most vulnerable women by stalkers and others and it justÂ breaks your heart.

Debbie Stabenow D-Lansing and Rep.

Donald Trump intends to nominate Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board according to people familiar with the matter.-- President Donald Trump said Thursday he is recommending Herman Cain a political ally and former presidential candidate for a seat on the Federal Reserve board.â€œIâ€™ve told my folks thatâ€™s the manâ€ù Trump told reporters in the Oval Office saying that Cain is currently going through background checks prior to a formal nomination.â€œHeâ€™s a very terrific man a terrific person. Heâ€™s a friend of mineâ€ù Trump said. â€œI have recommended him highly for the Fed.â€ùThe choice of Cain would mark the second Trump nomination that would elevate a conservative Trump ally to the Fedâ€™s main policy-making body a panel that the president has been highly critical of in recent months.The president last week said he plans to nominate Stephen Moore for a separate vacancy on the board. Mooreâ€™s nomination has encountered criticism that he is unqualified and too politically focused for a Fed board seat.Cain a former CEO of Godfatherâ€™s Pizza ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination but dropped out after allegations of sexual harassment and infidelity.The nominations of both Cain and Moore would require Senate confirmation. Sen. John Thune the GOP Whip said lawmakers would have questions for both men.â€œThey all have to go through the process and see whether or not theyâ€™re a good fit â€“ both in terms of qualifications and just the experience and everything elseâ€ù Thune said. â€œYou want somebody on the Fed to be somebody whoâ€™s very knowledgeable on economic issues.â€ùThe seven-member Fed board along with presidents of the Fedâ€™s regional banks plays a critical role in the U.S. economy holding regular meetings to debate and vote on interest rates that affect everything from savings accounts to mortgages.After Trump announced his intention to nominate Moore to the Fed board there have been published reports stating that Moore had a lien of more than $75000 filed against him in January 2018 for unpaid taxes and he has fallen behind on alimony and child support payments to his ex-wife.However Larry Kudlow head of the presidentâ€™s National Economic Council told reporters Wednesday that Trump is â€œfully behindâ€ù Mooreâ€™s nomination. Moore served as a campaign adviser to Trump in 2016 helping to formulate Trumpâ€™s tax cut plan.Moore has been highly critical of the Federal Reserve saying in December that Chairman Jerome Powell should be fired for backing a fourth Fed interest rate hike that month. Moore now says that comment was written â€œin a time of anger.â€ùCain met with Trump in January to discuss a possible nomination to the Fed board but at the time the White House said that Trump was looking at multiple candidates for the two Fed openings.Cain who served for a number of years on the board of directors of the Fedâ€™s Kansas City regional bank has also been critical of the central bankâ€™s policies.In a 2012 Wall Street Journal column Cain said that the Fedâ€™s policies manipulated the value of the dollar. In the article he advocated a return to the gold standard as a way to control inflation a position taken by other Fed critics but which many economists call unworkable.Cain in September co-founded a pro-Trump super political action committee America Fighting Back PAC. It features a photo of the president on its website and says: â€œWe must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.â€ùCain dropped out of the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination after allegations that he had engaged in sexual harassment when he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. An Atlanta woman also said she had conducted an extramarital affair with Cain for more than 13 years.Cain called the allegations false but said he had â€œmade mistakes in my life.â€ù Before leaving the race Cain had put forward a â€œ9-9-9â€ù tax plan that called for replacing the current tax system with a flat 9 percent business and individual income tax and a 9 percent sales tax.Trump has been highly critical Powell the person he picked to be Fed chairman after deciding that he would not renominate Janet Yellen. In addition to selecting Powell for the top job Trump has nominated all the current Fed board members with the exception of Lael Brainard who was nominated by Barack Obama.Trumpâ€™s other nominees have held views more in line with traditional selections for the Fed board. The White House announced Thursday that Trump was nominating Michelle Bowman a Kansas banking regulator for a full 14-year term on the Fed. She joined the Fed last year taking over a term that will end next year.Trump however has grown increasingly unhappy with Fed decisions under Powellâ€™s direction especially after the stock market took a nosedive last year as the central bank was hiking rates four times. Since January the Fed has reversed course and now says it expects no further rates hikes this year.Even with that change Trump has continued to be critical. Kudlow last week called for the Fed not only to pause rate hikes but to actually cut rates by one-half percentage point saying he and the president believed that was the best course of action.In a tweet Thursday Trump said the economy was looking very strong â€œdespite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed.â€ùRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/04/source-trump-selects-herman-cain-fed-board/39298947/,0

Iâ€™ll do one or the other and probably settle for the tariffsâ€ù Trump said at the White House.It was a dramatic departure for Trump who last week tweeted that he would close the border or large swaths of it this week unless Mexico immediately halted â€œALL illegal immigration coming into the United States.â€ùTrump said at the time that he was â€œnot kidding aroundâ€ù and his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in a television interview Sunday that it would take â€œsomething dramaticâ€ù for Trump not to close down the crossings.Since then however White House advisers American leaders in border cities and U.S. economists have warned that such a move would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border interrupting supply chains and boosting U.S. consumer prices on everything from avocadoes to autos.The U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which had said closing the border would be â€œan unmitigated economic debacleâ€ù that would threaten 5 million American jobs.In recent days Trump has appeared to put his threat on hold praising the Mexican government for doing more to apprehend migrants traveling through the country from Central America.On Thursday Trump also threatened tariffs if Mexico doesnâ€™t halt the flow of illegal drugs across the border saying heâ€™d give the country â€œa one year warningâ€ù to comply.â€œWe will put tariffs on if they donâ€™t apprehend and ultimately weâ€™re going to give a period time. But if in a year from now drugs continue to pour in weâ€™re going to put tariffs onâ€ù he said adding: â€œI donâ€™t play games.â€ùSeparately on Thursday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would file a lawsuit aimed at preventing Trump from â€œstealingâ€ù billions from federal programs and diverting the money to building barriers along the border.Trump declared a national emergency so he could use more money to construct the wall heâ€™s promised since his presidential campaign. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed that measure.Trump has been increasingly exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants entering the U.S. including thousands who have being released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100000 arrests or denials of entry in March a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children who require extra care.With southern border facilities near a breaking point U.S. officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches. Trump has mocked and vowed to end that â€œcatch and releaseâ€ù practice but overwhelmed authorities see no choice.Administration officials have been studying ways to minimize the economic impact of a potential closure in case Trump went through with his threat including keeping trucking lanes open or closing only certain ports.But even absent that threatened extraordinary step delays at border stations have been mounting after some 2000 border officers were reassigned from checking vehicles to deal with migrant crowds.Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/04/04/trump-threatens-tariffs-mexican-cars-border-fight/39299281/,0

The White House says the bill raises â€œserious constitutional concernsâ€ù and Congress lacks the votes to override him.By a 247-175 vote Congress for the first time invoked the decades-old War Powers Resolution to try and stop a foreign conflict.â€œThe president will have to face the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its constitutional obligations when it comes to foreign policyâ€ù said Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered by the war â€œdemands moral leadership.â€ùThe war is in its fifth year. Thousands of people have been killed and millions are on the brink of starvation. The United Nations has called the situation in Yemen the worldâ€™s worst humanitarian crisis.The top Republican on the committee Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians but he spoke out in opposition to the bill saying it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution.â€œThis radical interpretation has implications far beyond Saudi Arabiaâ€ù McCaul said. He warned that the measure could â€œdisrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 counties.â€ùOpposition to the Saudi-led war in Yemen gathered support last year in the aftermath of the killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Washington Post columnist was killed in October by agents of the kingdom a close U.S. partner while he was in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. U.S. intelligence agencies and lawmakers believe that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi who had written articles critical of the kingdom.Lawmakers from both parties have scrutinized U.S.-Saudi ties and criticized Trump for not condemning Saudi Arabia strongly enough.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/04/house-ends-support-yemen-war-rebuffs-trump/39298669/,0

Wheeler is telling CBS News in an interview airing Wednesday morning that climate change is â€œan important issueâ€ù but that most of the threats it poses are â€œ50 to 75 years out.â€ù(Photo: Andrew Harnik / AP file)â€” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler defended the Trump administration's decision to pullÂ out of talks withÂ California about new rules for gas mileage.Speaking to reporters Thursday at the WashingtonÂ Auto Show Wheeler said he is confidentÂ theÂ Trump administration's proposal to roll back stringent rulesÂ that would require automakers to produce fleets that average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 will hold up in court if it is successfully finalized later this year.""Our goal from the beginning was a 50-state solution"" he said. ""I met with (the California Air Resources Board) three times since taking the helm of EPA last July. But despite our best efforts we could not reach a solution and decided to end the discussions. We embrace federalism and the role of states but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate the standards for the entire nation.""Asked what would happen if California proceeds with a lawsuit that has already been filed over the proposal to rule back mileage rulesÂ Wheeler said:Â ""We'll go to court if they do that. I believe we're on firm legal footing and I believe that our standards will be upheld by the courts.""The TrumpÂ administration announced last year its intention to ease stringent gas-mileage rules that would have required fleets averaging more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The administrationÂ proposedÂ a freeze in the mandate after 2020 when their lineups must average 39 mpg.Automakers cheered the decision to reopen the so-called midterm review they were promised when the Obama-era gas mileage rules were agreed to in 2011. But they hoped the Trump administration would quickly reach an agreement with California on a new set of rules to prevent a lengthy legal battle that would leave the mpg requirements for the next half-decade in limbo.The Trump administration has floated the idea of moving to revoke a longstanding waiver allowing California and other states to set their own stricter auto emissions standards. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. have adopted Californiaâ€™s mileageÂ rules meaning automakers could be left with one set of rules for a quarter of the country and another set for the remaining states.Revoking California's waiver which is ensconced in the Clean Air Act would require an act of Congress that is unlikely with the U.S. House under Democratic control.Wheeler said the Trump administration is focused on making sure new cars are affordable enough for consumers to purchase new models that are more fuel-efficient.""Our overarching goal is to get more AmericansÂ into newer safer cleaner vehicles"" he said noting that the average age of a car on U.S. roadways is more than 12 years.WheelerÂ touted the EPA's enforcement actions against automakers that have been investigated for emissions violations. The agency reached an $800 million settlement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles this yearÂ to resolve allegationsÂ fromÂ federal regulators thatÂ the company used software on about 104000 diesel-powered pickups and SUVs that isÂ similar to â€œdefeat devicesâ€ùÂ used by Volkswagen AGÂ to cheat U.S. emissions-testing.""We're committed to vigorously enforcing the nation's environmental laws"" Wheeler said Thursday. ""EPA has stopped the sale of over 1 million after-market defeat devices...In this year alone we've stopped roughly 2220 illegal vehicles and engines atÂ the border and held the importers and the manufacturers accountable for many more illegal foreign products.""Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/04/04/epa-chief-defends-decision-pull-out-california-mpg-talks/3362660002/",0

Richard Neal who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee is the first such demand for a sitting presidentâ€™s tax information in 45 years.(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite / AP)â€“ A House committee chairman on Wednesday formally asked the IRS to provide six years of President Donald Trumpâ€™s personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses as Democrats try to shed light on his complex financial dealings and potential conflicts of interest.The request by Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee is the first such demand for a sitting presidentâ€™s tax information in 45 years. The move is likely to set off a huge legal battle between Democrats controlling the House and the Trump administration.Neal made the request in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig asking for Trumpâ€™s personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. He asked for the documents in seven days setting an April 10 deadline.Trump told reporters Wednesday he â€œwould not be inclinedâ€ù to provide his tax returns to the committee.Three of the eight Trump businesses in Nealâ€™s request are also among the 14 Trump legal entities that were subpoenaed by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington D.C. in a lawsuit now in a federal appeals court. That suit alleges that Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at his Washington hotel.The Trump businesses in the new request â€” part of Trumpâ€™s global empire of some 500 entities â€” include the trust he set up to handle all his holdings during his presidency making it the most important of the group.Also included is Trumpâ€™s golf club in Bedminster New Jersey.An IRS spokesman said the agency had no immediate comment on Nealâ€™s request.Democrats insist that obtaining Trumpâ€™s tax filings falls within their mandate of congressional oversight. Republicans have denounced it as a political witch hunt and invoked privacy concerns.â€œWe have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this magnitude and I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative legal and oversight rightsâ€ù Neal said in a statement Wednesday evening.Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas the senior Republican on the Ways and Means panel denounced the move as â€œan abuse of the tax-writing committeesâ€™ statutory authority.â€ùâ€œWeaponizing our nationâ€™s tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americansâ€™ privacy rightsâ€ù Brady wrote in a letter Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who oversees the IRS. â€œAs you know by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns.â€ùThe legal battle set to ensue could take years to resolve possibly stretching beyond the 2020 presidential election.Trump broke with decades of tradition for presidential candidates by refusing to release his income tax filings during his 2016 campaign. He has said he wonâ€™t release them because he is being audited even though IRS officials have said taxpayers under audit are free to release their returns. Trump claimed at a news conference following the November election that the filings are too complex for people to understand.The IRS has a policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents â€œyet little is known about the effectiveness of this programâ€ù Neal said in the statement. â€œOn behalf of the American people the Ways and Means Committee must determine if that policy is being followed and if so whether these audits are conducted fully and appropriately.â€ùNeal continued â€œIn order to fairly make that determination we must obtain President Trumpâ€™s tax returns and review whether the IRS is carrying out its responsibilities.â€ùNeal is one of only three congressional officials authorized to make a written request to the Treasury secretary for anyoneâ€™s tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service is part of the Treasury Department. A rarely used 1924 law says the Treasury chief â€œshall furnishâ€ù the requested material to members of the Ways and Means Committee for them to examine behind closed doors.A spokesman for Mnuchin didnâ€™t immediately respond to requests for comment.Mnuchin suggested in testimony to Congress last month that he would protect Trumpâ€™s privacy if the House Democrats requested his tax returns. â€œWe will examine the request and we will follow the law â€_ and we will protect the president as we would protect any taxpayerâ€ù regarding their right to privacy Mnuchin said.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/04/congress-trump-taxes/39296907/,0

Debbie Dingell that the NRA says ""politicized"" an otherwise noncontroversialÂ bill.Dingellâ€™s measure aims toÂ close the so-called ""boyfriend"" loophole byÂ amending federal law to include convicted abusers of current or former dating partners among thoseÂ prohibited from purchasing or owning firearms.Those convicted of domestic abuse currently can loseÂ their weapons only ifÂ their victim is their current or former spouse or they haveÂ a child with the victim.Dingell's provision also would prohibit firearm ownershipÂ by people convicted o""What we're trying to do it close a loophole. Keep women safe"" said Dingell a Dearborn Democrat.""It's not naming anybodyÂ who is innocent. If somebody can't get access to a gun it's because they wereÂ convicted of stalking or abuse.""The NRAÂ is urging lawmakers to oppose the bill which is set for a Thursday vote in the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.It argues there are no â€œloopholesâ€ù for domestic violence or stalking and that the legal system has sufficientÂ tools to prohibit dangerous individuals from possessing firearms.The group says itÂ hadÂ not previously gotten involved in the debate over the Violence Against Women Act first passed in 1994 because it didn'tÂ containÂ firearm provisions.The NRA saysÂ ""former dating partners"" is a subjective term that could be abused.

And Nessel's office said she will ""refrain from opining"" on the laws until the Supreme Court review is complete.The controversial minimum wage and paid sick leave laws changed in December and signed by then-Gov. Rick SnyderÂ took effect last week despite the ongoing legal reviews.Republicans have maintained their actions were in line with the state Constitution when rather than allowing the minimum wage and paid sick leave petitions to be placed on the ballot they adopted the proposals and amended them so as not to overly burden Michigan businesses.But Democrats have argued it is unconstitutional to adopt initiated legislation only to â€œgutâ€ù it in the same two-year session.Organizers had collected hundreds of thousands of petition signatures to send the proposals to the Legislature which has constitutional authority to adopt initiatives within 40 days or allow them to go to the ballot.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a Democrat who took office Jan. 1 had notÂ  heard about the Supreme Court development by mid-day Wednesday but said â€œlame-duck sessions move fast and furious and mistakes get made.â€ùSenate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey a Clarklake Republican who sponsored changes to the paid sick leave law and pushed for a Supreme Court review is ""eager to have the process move forward"" said spokeswoman Amber McCann.""He wishes the uncertainty would be removed sooner but he is confident in the eventual outcome and will remain patient.""Brian Calley president of the Small Business Association of Michigan who was lieutenant governor last year echoed the sentiments saying the Supreme Court ""has theÂ Â opportunity to improve the jobs climate by removing any uncertainty"" about the status of the laws.Nessel spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said the attorney general won't issue her own legal opinion on the laws ""unless or until the matter remains unsolved following the outcome"" of the Supreme Court review which she said is consistent with past precedent.But the Supreme Court has asked the Attorney General's office to submit legal briefs arguing ""both sides"" of the case"" Rossman-McKinney said calling it an ""unusual"" but ""not unprecedented"" request.""Twice in the last 10 years the Michigan Supreme Court has ordered the Department of Attorney General to brief both sides of an issue: in 2016 on the funding of private schools and in 2011 on taxing pensions"" she noted.Danielle Atkinson co-chair of the MI Time To Care committee that collected signatures for the paid sick leave initiative saidÂ lawmakers â€œfailed to followâ€ù the Constitution when they amended the law and she hopes the Michigan Supreme Court will agree.â€œWe believe the scheme was a clear violation of Michiganâ€™s Constitutionâ€ù she saidÂ  in a statement noting lawmakers have the option to send initiatives to the ballot approve them or also put an alternative before voters.â€œThe Legislature chose to create an unconstitutional fourth option by passing the law in September with the intention of gutting it in December before it ever took effectâ€ù Atkinson said.Under the amended lawsÂ Michiganâ€™s minimum wage is set to increase from $9.25 to $12.05 per hour by 2030 slowing the initial proposedÂ increase to $12 by 2022. The minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers will rise to $4.58 by 2030 instead of $12 by 2024.Lawmakers also exempted companies with fewer than 50 employees from the paid sick leave law ensuring it does not apply toÂ more than 160000 small businesses that collectively employ more than 1 million workers across the state.The Michigan Supreme Court is asking the Michigan House and Senate along with any member of either chamber to file legal briefs as it considers whether to issue an advisory opinion on the legality of the legislative maneuver.Other peopleÂ or groups can seek permission to file their own arguments in the matter. Briefs arguing for the constitutionality of the amended laws are due by May 15 while opposition briefs are due by June 19.While Nessel has been asked for her own legal opinion past attorneys general have offered conflicting opinions on the legality of the move.In a 1964 opinion then-Attorney General Frank Kelly a Democrat held that adopting an initiative sent to the Legislature through a petition drive only toÂ change it in the same session would violate â€œthe spirit and letterâ€ù of the process allowed under the 1963 Constitution.But former Attorney General Bill Schuette a Republican upended that opinion last year and gave his legal blessing to the adopt-and-amend strategy.Voters who approved the Michigan Constitution ""did not impose any express limitations on amending a legislatively enacted initiated lawâ€ù Schuette wrote in an opinion issued a day before Republicans proceeded to change both laws.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/michigan-supreme-court-arguments-gop-minimum-wage-sick-leave/3353306002/",0

And yes there are differences.â€ùThe NATO secretary general credited President Donald Trump with compelling allies to spend more on defense without noting that Trump also has questioned the value of the alliance and suggested that some members are freeloaders.Trumpâ€™s criticisms have upset a delicate balance within an alliance that has long counted on Washington to be its leader. Stoltenbergâ€™s speech provided a diplomatic counterpoint to Trumpâ€™s sometimes derisive rhetoric and the enthusiastic reception he received from both parties in the House was testament to an enduring pro-NATO consensus in Congress.â€œThe secretary general delivered to Congress a powerful affirmation of the value of the NATO allianceâ€ù said Rep. Mac Thornberry a Texas Republican.James Stavridis a retired Navy admiral who was NATOâ€™s top commander from 2009 to 2013 called the Stoltenberg address a high point in recent U.S.-European relations.â€œGiven the presidentâ€™s evident and frequently vocalized skepticism of the alliance it is clear that Congress â€“ on a bipartisan basis â€“ wants to put the full weight of the legislative branch behind NATOâ€ù Stavridis said. â€œWe will never find a better pool of allies in the world than the Europeans and this address underscores the importance of the trans-Atlantic bridge which has been creaking a bit lately.â€ùTrumpâ€™s criticisms are not NATOâ€™s only source of friction. The alliance also is at odds with long-time member Turkey over its planned purchase of a Russian air defense system that is not compatible with the allied air defenses. The Trump administration is threatening to stop delivery to Turkey of the newest U.S. fighter jet the F-35 if the Turks go through with their plan to buy Russiaâ€™s advanced S-400 system instead of the American Patriot system.Escalating that fight Vice President Mike Pence scolded Turkey at a NATO 70th anniversary event following Stoltenbergâ€™s speech. He said the Russian S-400 system â€œposes great danger to NATOâ€ù and suggested that Turkey needs to decide between NATO and Russia.â€œTurkey must chooseâ€ù he said. â€œDoes it want to remain a critical partner of the most successful military alliance in the history of the world or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making reckless decisions that undermine our alliance?â€ùStoltenberg made a point of highlighting the benefits to the United States of having NATO allies. He noted for example that in response to the attacks of Sept. 11 2001 NATO invoked Article 5 of its founding charter to come to the aid of a member under attack. He said allies also provide the U.S. with valuable military support in peacetime from tracking submarines in the Arctic to providing bases in Europe from which the U.S. can project power.â€œOur alliance has not lasted for 70 years out of a sense of nostalgia or of sentimentâ€ù he said. â€œNATO lasts because it is in the national interest of each and every one of our countries.â€ùStoltenberg on Thursday will lead a meeting of NATO foreign ministers hosted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to mark 70 years since the allianceâ€™s founding charter the North Atlantic Treaty. The alliance has grown from its original 12 members to 29 with the Republic of North Macedonia about to become the 30th member country.Stoltenberg a two-time former prime minister of Norway is the first head of NATO to address a joint meeting of Congress. He touted the allianceâ€™s long record of partnership but also noted it has a history of coping with internal divisions including strong opposition by France Germany and other members to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.â€œOpen discussions and different views is not a sign of weaknessâ€ù he said. â€œIt is a sign of strength. So we should not be surprised when we see differences between our countries. Today there are disagreements on issues such as trade energy climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. These are serious issues with serious disagreements.â€ùTrump has sharply criticized other NATO members including Germany for not meeting spending targets. On Tuesday he praised the generally upward trend among the European allies but hounded them to pay even more because he believes America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe.In a meeting at the White House Trump and Stoltenberg had kind words for each other. But in the past Trump has called NATO â€œobsoleteâ€ù and suggested he might pull the U.S. out of the alliance if member nations didnâ€™t significantly boost defense spending.â€œWeâ€™ve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair shareâ€ù Trump told reporters. â€œAt some point itâ€™s going to have to go higher.â€ùTrump took credit for the increased spending. However spending by NATO countries which dropped after the end of the Cold War has actually been rising since 2014 before Trump took office .After Russiaâ€™s 2014 annexation of Ukraineâ€™s Crimean Peninsula member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and â€œmove towardâ€ù spending 2% of their gross domestic products on defense by 2024. The U.S. spends about 3.4% of its GDP on defense.Since Trump took office European allies and Canada have added $41 billion to their defense budgets. By the end of next year this is scheduled to reach $100 billion Stoltenberg said. Germany remains the main target of Trumpâ€™s ire because it plans to spend 1.5% below the 2% guideline by 2024.Stoltenberg has said the 2% guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014.â€œThe allies are really stepping upâ€ù Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Associated Press.Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann and Susannah George in Washington and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

All Republicans voted for her appointment.Â King's nomination was held up for nearly a year as safety advocates raised questions about her performance in the interim role.King's nomination will go now to a vote of the fullÂ U.S. Senate which is controlled by Republicans by a 53-47 margin.A former senator Bill Nelson D-Fla.Â who blocked a vote on King's nomination due to concerns of her handling of recalls involving faulty air bags that were made by former Japanese manufacturer Takata was defeated in last November's election. His defeat cleared the way for the panel to move forward with a vote on King on Wednesday.King was one of eight nominations by Trump that was approved on Wednesday.The Center for Auto SafetyÂ a nonprofit that advocates for auto safety in Washington has urged lawmakers to vote against King's nomination.""Unfortunately in her eighteen months as Deputy Administrator Heidi Kingâ€™s record for removing unsafe vehicles from the road as well as getting safety features into vehicles raises serious concerns about her ability to effectively lead the nationâ€™s leading car safety and law enforcement agency"" the group said in a statement.Jason Levine executive director of the Center for Auto Safety accused King of being too close to the auto industry she is charged with regulating as the head of NHTSA.""Deaths and injuries from traffic crashes remain a public health crisis with over 37000 dead and over 2 million seriously injured every year"" saidÂ Levine.Â â€œNHTSA needs an Administrator whose focus is on the safety of each and every driver passenger and pedestrian. Much to our disappointment under Ms. Kingâ€™s leadership NHTSA continues to tell the world that safety is a priority but the agencyâ€™s actions show that it is industry needs which come first.â€ùKing came to NHTSA with a private sector background as global director of environmental health and safety risk at GE Capital.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/04/03/trumps-pick-nhtsa-chief-clears-u-s-senate-panel/3353494002/",0

Scott Applewhite / AP)â€“ The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions.The committee voted 24-17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for Muellerâ€™s investigation. Nadler has not yet said if heâ€™ll send the subpoenas.House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide the full report to Congress. The Justice Department ignored that deadline with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that a redacted version of the almost 400-page report would be released by mid-April â€œif not sooner.â€ùThe vote further escalates the Democratsâ€™ battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see a fight that could eventually end up in court if the two sides canâ€™t settle their differences through negotiation. Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr.In the letter last week Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that â€œwould unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.â€ùDemocrats say they want access to all of that information even if some of it canâ€™t be disclosed to the public. Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas â€œin very short order.â€ù He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information.â€œThis committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job not the attorney generalâ€™s to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his officeâ€ù Nadler said.The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald Trumpâ€™s former top advisers including strategist Steve Bannon communications director Hope Hicks chief of staff Reince Priebus White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson. Donaldson served as McGahnâ€™s chief of staff before both left the administration.The five were key witnesses in Muellerâ€™s probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month along with dozens of other people connected to Trump. Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to Muellerâ€™s investigation â€œwere sent outside the White Houseâ€ù meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege.The top Republican on the Judiciary panel Georgia Rep. Doug Collins said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate.Collins said the authorization for subpoenas is â€œrecklessâ€ù and that Democrats shouldnâ€™t be asking for documents that the Justice Department canâ€™t legally disclose to the public. The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information.â€œWe have a pre-emptive chairman who has gone out with pre-emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised himâ€ù Collins said. â€œThis is nothing but political theater.â€ùTrump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the reportâ€™s release while also saying he wouldnâ€™t mind if the full version was made public. Still he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information. He tweeted Tuesday that â€œthere is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfyâ€ù Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff who has also called for the full release.In a four-page summary of Muellerâ€™s report on March 24 Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that Trumpâ€™s campaign â€œconspired or coordinatedâ€ù with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation instead setting out â€œevidence on both sidesâ€ù of the question.Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter declaring that Muellerâ€™s evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/congress-russia-probe/39293119/,0

First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes. Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020.Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds. But in keeping the issue at the forefront the president put fresh attention on the GOPâ€™s long-running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA.â€œI was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me &amp; the Republican Partyâ€ù Trump tweeted adding â€œI never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election.â€ùThatâ€™s not how congressional Republicans including Senate Majority Leader McConnell understood Trumpâ€™s sudden shift to the issue last week.The GOPâ€™s bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president. He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen. John McCainâ€™s â€œnoâ€ù vote that killed the repeal-and-replace effort. Republicans hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one.Trumpâ€™s fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law. The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. While Trump wanted them to become â€œthe party of health careâ€ù they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do-over of the tough votes.McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House. The usually tight-lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign.â€œI made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senateâ€ù McConnell told reporters Tuesday.Facing a court deadline Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Trumpâ€™s motivations were as political as they were legislative mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to â€œrepeal and replaceâ€ù the Obama-era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration. He didnâ€™t want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly.â€œWeâ€™re going to keep the presidency and weâ€™ll vote in the best health care package weâ€™ve ever hadâ€ù Trump said.Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days. After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks.McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care â€“ namely trying to lower prescription drug prices according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call. But Trumpâ€™s promised big new health care bill wasnâ€™t going happen with Democrats running the House. Instead Trump could focus on the issue during the election.Trump told McConnell he â€œacceptedâ€ù the situation and â€œwould be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign.â€ù That night Trump tweeted as much.McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking â€œMedicare for Allâ€ù proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking.Associated Press writers Zeke Miller Laurie Kellman Alan Fram Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/trump-health-care/39293731/,0

(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)â€™s likability while President Trump and other Republicans dismiss her as a joke. But Iowa Democrats put her on the list of â€œnice guysâ€ù among the Democratic presidential contenders.Donâ€™t underestimate the power of nice in Iowa where pressing the flesh and old-fashioned retail politicking often help win the countryâ€™s leadoff caucuses.â€œThereâ€™s a lot of stir aroundlatelyâ€ù said Laura Hubka chairwoman of the Howardin northeast Iowa on the border with Minnesota.Asked about whoâ€™s nice she mentionedin the same breath as unequivocal nice guy Pete Buttigieg the mayor of South Bend Indiana who surged to third place in a recent Iowa poll.has made reining in Wall Street and corporate America her political hallmark and comes across to Iowa voters as â€œvery working-class friendlyâ€ù Ms. Hubka said.is considered nice and a good communicator.â€œFolks have described her to me as warm friendly and open. Those qualities are very important for the caucuses because as much as we want a nominee with strong intellectual ability and good judgment we also want a nominee who displays the kind of empathy and kindness we have for one anotherâ€ù he said. â€œâ€™s biggest strength is that she has all of those qualities.â€ùIt is a jarring image makeover for the senator from Massachusetts who was described in a January profile in Vanity Fair magazine as coming across on Capitol Hill as â€œholier than thouâ€ù â€œaloofâ€ù and having a â€œmoralizingâ€ù tone.Mr. Trump labeled her â€œPocahontasâ€ù to mock her erroneous claim of American Indian heritage underscoring criticism that she is a phony.But the two-term senatorâ€™s ability to connect with voters on the campaign trail including with an inspiring story of overcoming growing up poor in Oklahoma helped put her in the top tier of candidates in Iowa.She is running on lifting up working-class Americans by strengthening labor unions cracking down on corporations and imposing an â€œultramillionaire taxâ€ù to fund universal child care and student loan debt relief as well as starting to pay for the Green New Deal and a â€œMedicare for Allâ€ù program for government-run health care.finished a distant third with 9% support behind front-runner Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 26% and Bernard Sanders at 24.5% in a Real Clear Politics average of recent polls.A recent Emerson College survey showed Mr. Buttigieg Sen. Kamala D. Harris andclosely bunched behind the two front-runners with 11% 10% and 9% respectively.Sen. Cory A. Booker received 6% Beto Oâ€™Rourke got 5% and Sen. Amy Klobuchar got 2.5% in the early poll.Political strategist Doug Heye a former top adviser to the Republican National Committee said he wasnâ€™t completely surprised byâ€œWhere she can often come off as unlikable at least to Republicans in speeches thereâ€™s a broad sense Iâ€™ve heard among Democrats that she does very well in one-on-one conversations with votersâ€ù he said. â€œThat kind of direct voter contact the kind that people then tell their friends about is the name of the game in Iowa.â€ùHe cautioned that someone such ascould find it difficult to sustain her first impression in the spotlight of the debate stage though.â€œThat can tend to overshadow individual voter contactâ€ù Mr. Heye said.The Democratic field has plenty of other candidates vying for the â€œnice guyâ€ù title.â€œPeople really like Mayor Pete. They like Beto. Just from the standpoint of boy they do seem like nice peopleâ€ù said Bret Nilles chairman of thein Linn County Iowa. â€œThe only one who has the reputation of not being a real friendly person would be Sen. Sanders.â€ùAlthough Mr. Sanders lost the 2016 Iowa caucuses to Hillary Clinton by less than 1 percentage point and ranks as an early front-runner for 2020 Mr. Nilles said being nice remains a valuable currency.â€œYou donâ€™t have to be the front-runner right now to end up as the eventual winner of the Iowa caucus 330 days from nowâ€ù he said. â€œYou really want to build that relationship that connection now to encourage people to stick with you over these next 10 months and to be willing to come out there in February of 2020.â€ùCopyright Â© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.Click here for reprint permissioThe Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

Shh â€” technology may tattlShould President Trump release his tax returns?A new analysis from The Federalist contends that current progressive policy is simply warmed over baby boomer ideas from â€œleftiesâ€ù who grew up in the protest-driven 1960s. (Associated Press)Do some policy proposals from outspoken Democrats and progressives sound a little familiar? One analyst says that warmed over hippie fare is being cleverly recycled on the political landscape as 2020 looms and competition becomes more intense.â€œAll Democratsâ€™ â€˜newâ€™ ideas are just repackaged failures that baby boomers like. â€˜Medicare for Allâ€™ anti-nuclear sentiment universal basic income court-packing and doing away with the electoral college are old boomer ideas repackaged as something newâ€ù writes a senior contributor at The Federalist.â€œCourt packingâ€ù is expanding the size of the Supreme Court to 15 judges by the way.â€œThe Democratic Party or at least its 2020 presidential candidates and new stars are allegedly lurching significantly leftward. Sen.â€˜ platform seems to be a center of gravity even a bit of a throwback for relying mostly on class warfare instead of identity politics. Some seeas the avatar of old Democratic ideasâ€ù Mr. Henry observes.â€œThis may be the Democratsâ€™ dirty little secret: most of the big â€˜newâ€™ â€˜progressiveâ€™ ideas are really decades old. Most of these ideas have been flogged by the lefties who grew up among the New Left of the 1960s and â€˜70sâ€ù the analyst notes â€” and yes that recycling effort includes the Green New Deal.That they are retreads doesnâ€™t change the fact that these ideas are still radical Mr. Henry cautions â€” and they also have appeal to those who are unfamiliar with history.â€œThe Democratsâ€™ roots have always been in far-left ideologies.

Monday May 1 2017 after he unveiled a new rule on school lunches as the Trump administration and other Republicans press for ...By Jonathan Butcher and Vijay MenonThe National School Lunch Program has changed dramatically since it began in 1946. What started as a grant program to help poor students and those with special needs has morphed into a massive entitlement offering meals to 30 million students every year â€” equivalent to nearly 55% of all children enrolled in public and private schools.And the bigger the program got the more wasteful it became. The Office of Management and Budget now classifies the school lunch program as a â€œhigh-errorâ€ù program due to large losses from incorrect payments each year â€” nearly $800 million in FY 2018 alone.In 2010 the Obama administration approved letting school districts offer free meals to all students in schools where 40% of the student body come from low-income families that qualify for public assistance such as food stamps. This â€œCommunity Eligibility Provisionâ€ù is providing meals â€” breakfast as well as lunch â€” to kids from middle- and upper-income families.Federal regulations adopted to implement these changes to the lunch program further stretched the eligibility criteria. Districts have been permitted to combine the percentages of eligible students across groups of schools so they can offer free meals to students in schools that donâ€™t meet the 40% threshold.For example if only 20% of the students in School A are eligible for free meals but 61% of School Bâ€™s students meet the criteria the district can â€œcombineâ€ù the numbers and provide free meals to all students in both schools.Thatâ€™s problematic for taxpayers â€” and those who believe free food should be reserved for students truly in need.President Trumpâ€™s 2020 budget proposal would put an end to this practice of grouping schools together. The idea is to provide â€œbetter targeting [of] free meal benefits to children in need of assistanceâ€ù the original purpose of federal school meals.It would be a small but worthwhile improvement to a program that has been plagued by waste for years. The school lunch program has a habit of serving the wrong students which is why it lands on OMBâ€™s black list with lamentable regularity. As of 2016 the lunch program had an error rate of 16% while the school breakfast component had an improper payment rate of 23%.The 2010 expansion of taxpayer-funded meals only aggravated this problem because it ignores the errors by simply including more students regardless of family income. The program was already wasting food before taking in middle- and upper-middle class â€œbeneficiariesâ€ù who had no need â€” or appetite â€” for the food on offer. Adding students to the program does not address these issues of waste.The rationale behind the expansion was that it would give low-income families access school meals because they no longer have to apply for them. Yet other methods already in use work to more easily identify eligible students.For example over 90% of students from families participating in the food stamp program are automatically made eligible for free school meals. Thereâ€™s no need to give free meals to students who are not poor in order to help those who are.The 2010 Community Eligibility Provision runs contrary to the purpose of the school lunch program and should be eliminated entirely. Instead of watching taxpayer money get tossed into school trash cans lawmakers should work to reduce waste and redirect resources to children in need.Jonathan Butcher is a senior policy analyst in the Heritage Foundationâ€™s Center for Education Policy.

SisakNEW YORK â€” When FBI agents raidedâ€™s home and office a year ago Tuesday some pundits declared it the beginning of the end of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency. It was only a matter of time they speculated beforegave investigators a roadmap to Trumpâ€™s supposed misdeeds.stoked those flames as recently as Thursday by saying he was cooperating in federal probes he wasnâ€™t at liberty to discuss.And yet there are mounting indications thatâ€™s usefulness to federal prosecutors is drying up - and that he may wind up being the only person to go to prison for the hush-money scandal that has dogged Trumpâ€™s presidency.Several members of the team that prosecuted Trumpâ€™s former lawyer and fixer in New York have announced they are moving on to other jobs something that usually happens when a big case is winding down.Prosecutors have also been returning electronic devices and documents seized from an indication those materials might not be needed for future prosecutions.And special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s closing of his probe into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election effectively shuts the door onemerging as a key witness in that investigation.â€œTheyâ€™re not going to be making any new cases with his testimonyâ€ù predicted David S.

Investigations continue into the presidentâ€™s inaugural committee. Among other things authorities are looking into payments made to vendors and whether foreigners illegally donated.New York state officials are also examiningâ€™s claims to Congress that Trump fudged the value of his assets with dealing with insurance companies and banks.would play a central role as a witness in any of those investigations is unclear.Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani dismissedâ€™s plea to Congress to help him remain free as â€œpretty hilarious.â€ùhas already spilled his gutsâ€ù Giuliani said Sunday on CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation.â€ù â€ùHe has nothing at all incriminating onâ€ù Trump.Asked on the same program whether House Democrats would be willing to write letters onâ€™s behalf House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler was noncommittal.Trump himself sounded unconcerned aboutlast week saying â€œHeâ€™s old news.â€ùâ€™s spokesman Lanny Davis didnâ€™t comment.burst into view on April 9 2018 when agents seized documents from his hotel room his Manhattan apartment his law office and a safety deposit box.

By August he had pleaded guilty and told prosecutors that Trump himself had instructed him to buy the womenâ€™s silence. The Justice Department argued that those payments amounted to undisclosed illegal campaign contributions.has faced charges in that case. Longstanding Justice Department policy says a sitting president shouldnâ€™t be indicted. Federal prosecutors agreed not go after the parent company of the National Enquirer for funneling the money to McDougal. And Allen Weisselberg who as chief financial officer of Trumpâ€™s business empire was implicated in the hush-money case by cooperated with prosecutors and might not be charged.A federal judge revealed in a February ruling that the governmentâ€™s hush-money probe remained open. Whether that is still the case is unclear. The judge has given prosecutors a May 15 deadline to provide him with an update as he decides whether to unseal more of the Cohen file.In the meantime the prosecutor who originally oversaw the campaign finance probe Robert Khuzami has announced that he is leaving the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Manhattan on April 12 for undisclosed reasons.The most senior assistant U.S. attorney assigned to the investigation Rachel Maimin left for private practice in recent weeks.

Last August he pleaded guilty to violating foreign lobbying laws through his efforts on behalf of a Ukrainian political party.Prosecutors did not recommend a sentence for but did say he deserves leniency for his cooperation which they described as â€œimmediate.â€ùhas met with government investigators in person or by phone a total of nine separate times to answer numerous questions and explain various documentsâ€ù prosecutors wrote. â€œIn all of these sessionshas been honest and straightforward with government investigators.â€ùDefense attorneys have asked for probation saying he did not try to conceal his work for on behalf of the Ukrainian political party nor did he try to hide the money he earned form the IRS.â€œ[D]uring the course of a long business relationship whereadvised his clients on matters related solely to Ukrainian politics and elections he did a few favors for his clients that crossed the line into FARA-registrable activityâ€ù his attorney Stuart Sears wrote.Prosecutors declined to offer more information about his cooperation saying it would the issue would be addressed in a sealed filing.One case in which he appeared to provide cooperation was against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

SISAKNEW YORK (AP) - When FBI agents raidedâ€™s home and office a year ago Tuesday some pundits declared it the beginning of the end of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency. It was only a matter of time they speculated beforegave investigators a roadmap to Trumpâ€™s supposed misdeeds.stoked those flames as recently as Thursday by saying he was cooperating in federal probes he wasnâ€™t at liberty to discuss.And yet there are mounting indications thatâ€™s usefulness to federal prosecutors is drying up - and that he may wind up being the only person to go to prison for the hush-money scandal that has dogged Trumpâ€™s presidency.Several members of the team that prosecuted Trumpâ€™s former lawyer and fixer in New York have announced they are moving on to other jobs something that usually happens when a big case is winding down.Prosecutors have also been returning electronic devices and documents seized from an indication those materials might not be needed for future prosecutions.And special counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s closing of his probe into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election effectively shuts the door onemerging as a key witness in that investigation.â€œTheyâ€™re not going to be making any new cases with his testimonyâ€ù predicted David S. Weinstein a former federal prosecutor in Miami.scheduled to report to prison May 6 his attorneys have reached out to Democrats in Congress asking them to write letters sayingâ€™s three-year sentence for tax evasion campaign finance violations and other crimes should be postponed because his help is needed going through a â€œsubstantial trove of new information documents recordings and other evidence.â€ù But tellingly federal prosecutors themselves made no such request.To be sure federal authorities in New York donâ€™t appear to be finished scrutinizing people close to Trump. Investigations continue into the presidentâ€™s inaugural committee. Among other things authorities are looking into payments made to vendors and whether foreigners illegally donated.New York state officials are also examiningâ€™s claims to Congress that Trump fudged the value of his assets with dealing with insurance companies and banks.would play a central role as a witness in any of those investigations is unclear.Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani dismissedâ€™s plea to Congress to help him remain free as â€œpretty hilarious.â€ùhas already spilled his gutsâ€ù Giuliani said Sunday on CBSâ€™ â€œFace the Nation.â€ù â€ùHe has nothing at all incriminating onâ€ù Trump.Asked on the same program whether House Democrats would be willing to write letters onâ€™s behalf House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler was noncommittal.Trump himself sounded unconcerned aboutlast week saying â€œHeâ€™s old news.â€ùâ€™s spokesman Lanny Davis didnâ€™t comment.burst into view on April 9 2018 when agents seized documents from his hotel room his Manhattan apartment his law office and a safety deposit box.

By August he had pleaded guilty and told prosecutors that Trump himself had instructed him to buy the womenâ€™s silence. The Justice Department argued that those payments amounted to undisclosed illegal campaign contributions.has faced charges in that case. Longstanding Justice Department policy says a sitting president shouldnâ€™t be indicted. Federal prosecutors agreed not go after the parent company of the National Enquirer for funneling the money to McDougal. And Allen Weisselberg who as chief financial officer of Trumpâ€™s business empire was implicated in the hush-money case by cooperated with prosecutors and might not be charged.A federal judge revealed in a February ruling that the governmentâ€™s hush-money probe remained open. Whether that is still the case is unclear. The judge has given prosecutors a May 15 deadline to provide him with an update as he decides whether to unseal more of the Cohen file.In the meantime the prosecutor who originally oversaw the campaign finance probe Robert Khuzami has announced that he is leaving the U.S. attorneyâ€™s office in Manhattan on April 12 for undisclosed reasons.The most senior assistant U.S. attorney assigned to the investigation Rachel Maimin left for private practice in recent weeks.

Trump is returning from a trip to California and Nevada. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)A U.S. judge decided Monday to block the Trump administrationâ€™s policy of returning asylum seekers toas they wait for an immigration court to hear their cases but the ruling is on hold for several days.Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco granted a request on behalf of 11 asylum seekers from Central America and legal advocacy groups to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward but he held off on enforcing his decision until Friday to give the government a chance to ask an appeals court for a review.The policy lacks sufficient protections to ensure migrants donâ€™t face â€œundue risk to their lives or freedomâ€ù in the judge said. Seeborg also said a law that President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration cited as its authority to send back migrants does not apply to asylum seekers such as those who sued.It was not immediately clear whether the administration would ask an appeals court to put the ruling on hold. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.The launch of the policy in January at the nationâ€™s busiest border crossing - in San Diego - marked an unprecedented change to the U.S. asylum system government officials and asylum experts said. Families seeking asylum typically have been released in the U.S. with notices to appear in court.The Trump administration says the policy responds to a crisis at the southern border that has overwhelmed the ability of immigration officials to detain migrants. Growing numbers of families are fleeing poverty and gang violence in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador.The ruling came a day after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned and as the administration faces repeated court setbacks on strict anti-immigration measures that were a signature campaign promise for Trump including losses on such policies as separating families at the border and ending protections for young immigrants.The lawsuit says the Trump administration is violating U.S. law by failing to adequately evaluate the dangers that migrants face inUnder the new policy asylum seekers are not guaranteed interpreters or lawyers and donâ€™t get to argue to a judge that they face the potential of persecution or torture if they are sent back to Judy Rabinovitz an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said at a March court hearing.Seeborg said in his ruling that â€œfurther procedural protections would be required to conform to the governmentâ€™s acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.â€ùThe ACLU and other groups also argue in the lawsuit that a law allowing the return of some immigrants todoes not apply to asylum seekers who cross the border illegally or arrive at a border crossing without proper documents.Seeborg agreed saying the â€œplain languageâ€ù of the law supported that interpretation.â€œTry as it may the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United Statesâ€ù Rabinovitz said in a statement after the ruling.The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait inwill discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800000 cases.Justice Department attorney Scott Stewart said at the March hearing that there was a process to protect immigrants who could face harm in. All 11 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are represented by attorneys and 10 already have appeared for court proceedings he said.Border Patrol arrests the most widely used gauge of illegal crossings have risen sharply over the last year but are relatively low in historical terms after hitting a 46-year low in 2017.The launch of the policy followed months of delicate talks between the U.S. and. Mexicans and children traveling alone are exempt from it.Copyright Â© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.The Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

As Customs and Border Protection commissioner he helped put in practice a â€œzero toleranceâ€ù policy on illegal entries that caused thousands of children to be separated from their families at the border. He also oversaw the rapid spread of a practice to limit the number of asylum seekers who can enter the country at border crossings with Mexico which he blames on processing constraints.He has also shown strong interest in understanding why large numbers of Central American families are coming to the U.S. traveling to Guatemalaâ€™s western highlands last year on a fact-finding mission. He put renewed emphasis on providing medical attention to migrants after two Guatemalan children died in U.S. custody.angered many Democrats when he didnâ€™t mention the death of one of those children a girl during congressional testimony last year.

No previous administration had tested that policy under President Trump who suggested it in one of his first executive orders in 2017.His administration began to implement it earlier this year hoping that making migrants wait outside the U.S. â€” thereby denying them the chance to gain a foothold here â€” would discourage some of the Central Americans rushing the border right now from coming.The program has gotten a slow start. Homeland Security has been reluctant to talk numbers but was only slowly expanding the program and working withto make sure that country was ready to handle the people the U.S. would be sending back.But last week Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she was expanding use of the program.She was ousted from her position Sunday.Copyright Â© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.Click here for reprint permissioThe Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

Shh â€” technology may tattlShould President Trump release his tax returns?ST. PAUL Minn. (AP) -said Monday that his administration has renewed its challenge to a regulatory panelâ€™s approval of Enbridge Energyâ€™s plan to replace its aging Line 3 crude oil pipeline across northern Minnesota saying he wants to let the legal process play out.told reporters the Commerce Department refiled its appeal last week with the Minnesota Court of Appeals which had dismissed earlier appeals in the case on procedural grounds. The independent Public Utilities Commission last month gave its final reaffirmation of its earlier approvals of the project clearing the way for the department and the environmental and tribal groups to refile appeals that began under previous Gov Mark Daytonâ€™s administration.â€œWe think that that appeal should simply be heard and thatâ€™s fairâ€ù he said.The Democratic governor said the stateâ€™s appeal doesnâ€™t delay the timeline for the permitting process for or construction on the replacement pipeline because the state isnâ€™t seeking an injunction. Regulators have told Enbridge that they expect to certify all remaining state permits by November. The company hopes to put the new pipeline into service in the second half of 2020.Calgary Alberta-based Enbridge wants to replace Line 3 which was built in the 1960s because itâ€™s increasingly prone to cracking and corrosion. Native American and environmental groups argue that the project risks oil spills in pristine areas of the Mississippi River headwaters region and that the Canadian tar sands oil that the line would carry accelerates climate change.Enbridge said in a statement that it believes the courts will affirm the commissionâ€™s decisions â€œwhich were made in accordance with the law based on full and complete evidence developed and presented over years of open and transparent regulatory and environmental review processes.â€ùwas critical of lawmakers whoâ€™ve tried unsuccessfully to prohibit the state from spending taxpayer money on the appeal calling their efforts â€œa gross violation of the separation of powers.â€ùThe legal issue at the heart of the Commerce Departmentâ€™s appeal is whether Enbridge provided legally adequate long-range demand forecasts to establish the need for the project. The Public Utilities and Enbridge say the company did.said the statutory language is ambiguous and that there would no basis for the stateâ€™s appeal if lawmakers clarified the statute.House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt said Republicans are â€œincredibly disappointedâ€ù by the decision to pursue a further appeal against a new pipeline that would be the â€œsafest most environmentally friendly wayâ€ù to transport the oil and would create jobs and increase property tax revenues for communities along the route.â€œWhat the governor is trying to do is play both sidesâ€ù Daudt said. â€œI think heâ€™s trying to say that â€˜Well this is ultimately going to happen but I can at least tell the people that were against it I was with them.â€™ And to me thatâ€™s a failure of leadership.â€ùCopyright Â© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.The Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

Shh â€” technology may tattlShould President Trump release his tax returns?HARRISBURG Pa. (AP) - A proposal to enshrine the rights of crime victims in the Pennsylvania Constitution was approved overwhelmingly Monday in the state House moving it avote away from going before voters in a referendum.Pennsylvaniaâ€™s proposed version of Marsyâ€™s Law which passed 190-8 would give victims the right to be notified to attend and to weigh in during plea hearings sentencings and parole proceedings.Supporters say the amendment will help ensure victims are not ignored during court proceedings.But opponents warned it could infringe on the rights of criminal defendants to get a fair and speedy trial. They argue that its wording is vague and that itâ€™s difficult to predict how judges will enforce it.â€œIf you put it into a constitutional amendment thatâ€™s a very rigid thing and hard to changeâ€ù said Rep. Greg Vitali R-Delaware. â€œAnd if you realize there are unintended consequences to what youâ€™ve done as far as changing the constitution itâ€™s a very difficult thing to change.â€ùIt passed both legislative chambers in the past session soapproval later this year could put it on the ballot in November.Rep. Jason Dawkins D-Philadelphia said there are not sufficient resources to provide notice to victims of all relevant court proceedings.â€œThis bill does not address the fact that even if we make the changes that are proposed in this bill there could still be families that do not get the notification and there is nothing in this particular bill that addresses thatâ€ù Dawkins said.A 2-decade-old law grants Pennsylvania crime victims access to services and information about hearings and the offenderâ€™s release from incarceration. The proposed amendment would give victims legal standing to go to court if those existing rights are violated according to the state district attorneysâ€™ association.The Department of State has said the referendum could make the November ballot if it passes the gets reviewed by the attorney generalâ€™s office and is ready to be advertised by Aug. 5. If voters approve it would take effect at the start of 2020.Copyright Â© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.The Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

Democratic officials in counties across the Hawkeye State said his near-universal name recognition accounts for his early lead but he is so well known that he doesnâ€™t generate the excitement needed to grow his base.â€œA lot of people are saying maybe his numbers have peakedâ€ù said Bret Nilles thechairman in Linn County the second most populous county in the state and home to Cedar Rapids. â€œPeople seem to be leaning toward saying â€˜I want somebody new and somebody energetic.â€™â€ùappears as a generational split with opposition coming mostly from younger Democrats who tilt further left or embrace socialist ideas.But Mr. Nilles 60 said the thirst for a new leader also comes fromâ€™s generation who mostly do not object to his hands-on interactions with women in public settings.â€œI just got off the phone a couple minutes ago with my mother and she said â€˜Boy you know I really like Joe as a personâ€™ â€ù he said noting that his mother metduring his 2008 presidential run. â€œAnd she said â€˜Maybe it is not his time any longer.â€™ Thatâ€™s my mother and she is older than him.

Trump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on Border | RealClearPoliticTrump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on BordeTrump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on BordeTrump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on BordeVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned amid President Donald Trumpâ€™s growing frustration and bitterness over the number of Central American families crossing the southern border.Trump announced on Sunday in a tweet that U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department. McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well-respected by members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects Trumpâ€™s priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.â€œI have determined that it is the right time for me to step asideâ€ù Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. â€œI hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure Americaâ€™s borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationâ€™s discourse.â€ùThough Trump aides were eyeing aÂ staff shake-upÂ at Homeland Security and had alreadyÂ withdrawn the nominationÂ for another key immigration post the development Sunday was unexpected.Nielsen traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed Trumpâ€™s comments on the situation at the border though she ducked out of the room without explanation for some time while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers Nielsen was at Trumpâ€™s side introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward on a Coast Guard Gulfstream as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.Nielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether sheâ€™d be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning though she was not forced to do so they said.Nielsen is the latest person felled in the Trump administrationâ€™s unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials brought about by the presidentâ€™s mercurial management style insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.Nielsen was also the highest profile female Cabinet member and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and the White House staff itself without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary Jim Mattis was pushed out in December over criticism of the presidentâ€™s Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January following John Kellyâ€™s resignation last year.HerÂ resignation lettÂ er lacked any sense of controversy â€” unlike those of others who have left. She thanked Trump and DHS staff for their hard work.Her replacement McAleenan has helped shape many of the administrationâ€™s policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders the White House and Homeland Security officials. But itâ€™s unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary after her predecessor Kelly became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.Once Kelly left the White House Nielsenâ€™s days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November but her exit never materialized. During the government shutdown over Trumpâ€™s insistence for funding for a border wall Nielsenâ€™s standing inside the White House even appeared to rise.But in recent weeks as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign tensions flared anew.The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello â€” a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller an immigration hardliner and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views the people said.Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday but when there was no time she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March over half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers â€” scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday â€” was postponed.Nielsen dutifully pushed Trumpâ€™s immigration policies including funding for his border wall and defended the administrationâ€™s practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens â€œin the United States every day.â€ù But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.Under Nielsen migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3000 families and facilities are at capacity.She also advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and often said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online â€” not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2018 election.She led the federal agency since December 2017 and was this administrationâ€™s third Homeland Security secretary. A protege of Kellyâ€™s he brought her to the White House after Trump named him chief of staff. She earned a reputation as an enforcer working to corral the chaotic West Wing.Nielsen 45 previously served as a special assistant to President George W. Bush and worked for the Transportation Security Administration.She rose through the Trump ranks quickly â€” joining the transition team after the election to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process. She quickly became a trusted aide to Kelly and the two worked together to impose order on a dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said her tenure was â€œa disaster from the start.â€ù The policies she helped create â€œhave been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.â€ùHis Senate counterpart Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis. said the government needed â€œsteady informed and effective leadership in the administration and in Congress to have any hope of fixing our out-of-control border security and immigration problems.â€ùLog In with your RCMG Accoun,0
Bernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-Runner | RealClearPoliticBernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-RunneBernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-RunneBernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-RunneVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...DAVENPORT Iowa (AP) â€” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is quieting critics who questioned whether he could recapture the energy of his upstart 2016 campaign surpassing his rivals inÂ early fundraisingÂ and establishing himself as an indisputable front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.Less than two months into hisÂ second White House bidÂ  no other declared candidate in the crowded Democratic field currently has amassed so many advantages: a $28 million war chest a loyal and enthusiastic voter base and a set of clearly defined policy objectives.That puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns which he has not yet released. He initially blamed â€œmechanical issuesâ€ù for the delay and his campaign now says he wants to wait until after the April 15 tax filing deadline to fulfill hisÂ promise to release a decade worth of returnsÂ .Sanders has largely embraced his new front-runner status. More than any other candidate he draws explicit comparisons with President Donald Trump in his campaign remarks previewing his approach to a general election faceoff with the incumbent Republican. Behind the scenes Sanders is also building out a larger more diverse campaign operation responding to criticism that his 2016 organization skewed too heavily white and male. Campaign officials say the 2020 campaign staff â€” roughly 100 people and growing â€” is majority female and 40 percent people of color.Still Sandersâ€™ message and style hasnâ€™t changed from 2016 when he stunned many Democrats by mounting a formidable challenge to Hillary Clinton and besting her in more than 20 primary contests.After briefly acquiescing to his advisersâ€™ suggestions that he reveal more about his upbringing and personal history Sanders has returned to his comfort zone: delivering lengthy campaign speeches chockablock with the same policy prescriptions he campaigned on during the 2016 campaign. In Davenport Iowa on Friday night Sanders spent 63 minutes outlining his views on health care criminal justice reform and economic inequality.â€œWith your help we are going to complete what we started hereâ€ù Sanders told the 1200-person crowd referring to his virtual tie with Clinton in the 2016 Iowa caucuses.Sandersâ€™ approach underscores his belief that his success in 2016 was not a fluke or simply a function of being the next best alternative to Clinton. His advisers argue the populist economic message Sanders has espoused for years often in obscurity has now been embraced not only by a slew of his Democratic rivals but also Trump.â€œDonald Trump campaigned on economic terms as faux Bernie Sanders. It was taking his language and selling it to the American peopleâ€ù said Faiz Shakir Sandersâ€™ campaign manager. â€œAnd now how do you defeat faux Bernie Sanders? You defeat him with real Bernie Sanders.â€ùSanders owes some of his fast start to the fact that he never really stopped running for president after the 2016 campaign. Our Revolution the political group Sanders launched after the campaign has collected information on voters and held events in early voting states since the last election. Sanders was also active in the 2018 midterms throwing his support behind progressive Democratic candidates across the country though many were defeated.â€œHe spent 2018 lifting up progressives all over the countryâ€ù said Rebecca Katz a progressive Democratic consultant. â€œEven though many of them did not win it was appreciated it was movement building and it was a different calculation than most politicians make.â€ùDespite his strong launch Sandersâ€™ current standing atop the Democratic field is not entirely enviable. Presidential primaries are long and turbulent and past elections underscore how many early front-runners have been tossed aside before the first votes are cast. Former Vice President Joe Biden has signaled his expected presidential campaign would serve as a centrist check on Sandersâ€™ brand of progressive politics.And though Sandersâ€™ $18 million first-quarter fundraising haul far outpaced the rest of the Democratic field some rival campaigns breathed a sigh of relief having anticipated the Vermont senator would clear $20 million or more.â€œHe did very well. He could have done betterâ€ù said Mo Elleithee who advised Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2008 presidential campaign and now runs the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service.Sanders also still has to prove that he can overcome some of the same vulnerabilities that contributed to his defeat in 2016.Chief among them will be bolstering his standing with black voters one of the most important constituencies in Democratic politics. Black voters overwhelmingly sided with Clinton in 2016 halting Sandersâ€™ momentum when the contest moved into more diverse states. He lost the South Carolina primary by a staggering 48 points.Some of Sandersâ€™ top advisers dismiss the notion that heâ€™ll face similar problems in 2020 noting that he has spent time building relationships with black leaders in South Carolina and other Southern states. Heâ€™s also sharpened his campaign message on criminal justice issues and racial inequality.â€œI understand that a lot of people took a lot of things out of the South Carolina resultsâ€ù Shakir said. â€œWe are going to continue to court and address these issues directly but we are operating with a great deal of confidence that this is going to be a particular demographic that supports Bernie Sanders at the end of the day.â€ùPerhaps Sandersâ€™ biggest challenge is overcoming skepticism among voters who may be partial to his focus on economic inequality but fear that nominating a 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist would put Democrats in a weak position against Trump in the general election.â€œThatâ€™s a thing that scares me about himâ€ù said Gwen Hobson a 70-year-old Democratic voter who attended Sandersâ€™ rally on Friday in Davenport.Yet some of Sandersâ€™ longtime supporters say their enthusiasm for him is unshakable. In Davenport on Friday several voters donned faded t-shirts from Sandersâ€™ 2016 campaign. Melita Tunnicliff 57 wore a button she bought during that campaign with Sandersâ€™ photo and the phrase â€œNot For Sale.â€ùAsked if she was open to other Democratic candidates this time around Tunnicliff shook her head no.â€œIâ€™ve been waiting for Bernieâ€ù she said.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
White House Says Democrats Will Never See Trump Tax Returns | RealClearPoliticWhite House Says Democrats Will Never See Trump Tax ReturnWhite House Says Democrats Will Never See Trump Tax ReturnWhite House Says Democrats Will Never See Trump Tax ReturnVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Democrats will â€œneverâ€ù see President Donald Trumpâ€™s tax returns said White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as a new front opened in the confrontation between the administration and Congress.Mulvaney accused Democrats of engaging in a â€œpolitical stuntâ€ù and wanting â€œattentionâ€ù after the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Rep. Richard NealÂ asked the IRS to provide six years of Trumpâ€™s personal tax returnsÂ and the returns for some of his businesses.â€œThat is not going to happen and they know itâ€ù Mulvaney told â€œFox News Sunday.â€ùAsked whether he believes Democrats would ever view the presidentâ€™s returns Mulvaney replied: â€œOh no never. Nor should they.â€ùLast week Massachusetts Democrat Neal one of only three congressional officials authorized to request tax returns requested Trumpâ€™s personal and business returns in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. He asked for returns covering 2013 through 2018. He also asked for the documents in seven days setting an April 10 deadline.An obscure 1924 statute includes no exceptions to Nealâ€™s authority to ask the Treasury Department for returns and says the department â€œshall furnishâ€ù them when requested. It does require that the review of an individualâ€™s return be conducted by members of Congress in â€œclosed executive sessionâ€ù if the returns are provided without the taxpayerâ€™s consent.Still Mulvaney claimed the law provides for lawmakers to review individual tax returns but â€œpolitical hit job is not one of those reasons.â€ù His comments echoed those made by Trumpâ€™s lawyers who argued the Democratic requestÂ â€œwould set a dangerous precedentâ€ùÂ if granted.Trump broke with precedent when he chose not to release any tax returns as a presidential candidate. Mulvaney tried to cast the issue of the presidentâ€™s taxes as old news saying it was â€œalready litigated during the electionâ€ù and the American people â€œelected him anyway.â€ùTrump has said he wonâ€™t release the information because he is under audit something he reiterated again Friday while visiting the U.S-Mexico border.â€œIâ€™m under audit. When youâ€™re under audit you donâ€™t do itâ€ù Trump said.IRS officials have said taxpayers under audit are free to release their returns. Trump claimed at a news conference following his election in November 2018 that the filings are too complex for people to understand.William Consovoy whose firm was retained by Trump to represent him on the matter said in a letter Friday to the Department of Treasuryâ€™s general counsel that the tax code zealously guards taxpayer privacy. He said requests for tax returns â€œmust have a legitimate legislative purpose.â€ùNeal has said he made the request to review the IRS policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents saying â€œlittle is known about the effectiveness of this program.â€ùâ€œOn behalf of the American people the Ways and Means Committee must determine if that policy is being followed and if so whether these audits are conducted fully and appropriatelyâ€ù Neal said when unveiling his request for Trumpâ€™s returns.Utah Sen.

But the majority leaderâ€™s focus on confirming President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominees is coming at the expense of any big legislative priorities.Nearly 100 days into the new Congress the drive to confirm is adding more conservatives to the courts and putting more Trump appointees in government offices. But Trumpâ€™s promises to replace the Affordable Care Act invest in infrastructure or cut middle class taxes have been essentially shelved.The result is that the GOP-controlled Senate is on a very different path heading into the 2020 election than is the House where the Democratic majority is churning out a long list of bills on ethics gun violence and other topics that while unlikely to become law show voters their priorities.Sara Binder an expert on Congress at George Washington University said there doesnâ€™t seem to be much room in the Senate â€œto set out a policy agenda and make some progress toward it.â€ù She added: â€œIt does leave on the table quite a number of issues that donâ€™t get any progress.â€ùUnderlying his strategy McConnell R-Ky. engineered a rules change last week to speed the confirmation process pushing past Democratsâ€™ stalling of Trumpâ€™s picks for administration jobs and district courts.â€œLook we know you donâ€™t like Donald Trump but there was an electionâ€ù McConnell argued on the Senate floor to the Democrats saying the president â€œis at least entitled to set up the administration and make it function.â€ùDemocratic senators see a much more deliberative strategy. Rather than try to work with Democrats â€” and Trump â€” to pass bills that can be turned into law they say McConnell is simply blocking bills from the House while spending his time packing the courts with conservatives judges as part of a broader legacy of reshaping the judiciary.Already McConnell spent the first two years of the administration confirming a record 30 circuit court nominees. With seven more confirmed this year heâ€™s now turning to the district courts; four nominees already are teed up for Senate action.â€œWhat Leader McConnell President Trump and Republicans in the Senate are trying to do is use the courts to adopt the far-right agenda that Republicans know they cannot enact through the legislative processâ€ù Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said during the floor debate.In an earlier time McConnell was an advocate of capitalizing on divided government to foster deal-making. Compromises between Democrats and Republicans ended a budget crisis during President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration and produced bills on other education and topics.But so far this year the big-ticket items have been elusive. Trump wanted GOP senators to try again to replace Obamaâ€™s health care law but without a substantive plan McConnell quashed that effort until after the 2020 election.Republicans are quick to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. saying thereâ€™s almost nothing Senate Republicans and House Democrats can agree on. As if to prove the point McConnell forced the Senate into a vote on the Green New Deal from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey D-Mass. highlighting Democratic tensions with the liberal flank of their party.Yet itâ€™s clear that Republicans have had their own difficulty with Trump whose shifting positions have left them without fully shared policy priorities. For example many Republicans oppose Trumpâ€™s tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations. One major bill that did pass the Senate rebuked Trumpâ€™s plan to withdraw troops from Syria.Trump opposed two substantive measures that cleared both chambers of Congress. He vetoed one that went against his national emergency to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall and has threatened to veto another thatâ€™s opposing U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen.â€œIf youâ€™re talking about a big bold vision yea Iâ€™d like to do entitlement reform Iâ€™d like to do tax reform 2.0 â€” there are a whole bunch of things on the economic agenda that I think we can do but those things arenâ€™t going to move in a Democrat Houseâ€ù said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota the second-ranking Republican.â€œItâ€™s just hard right nowâ€ù he said. â€œIn terms of legislative expectations I think weâ€™re being realistic and not setting the bar too high but there are some things that I think can get done.â€ùOne of the only jobs McConnell ever wanted was in the Senate he says in his biography â€œThe Long Game.â€ù But after more 30 years in office the majority leader often seen as an institutionalist is steadily changing the way the chamber operates.In many ways heâ€™s simply building on the moves made by a predecessor Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada who used the â€œnuclear optionâ€ù to change the rules to more easily approve Obamaâ€™s Cabinet officials and most judges with a majority rather than the 60-vote threshold in the 100-member Senate.McConnell took it further going â€œnuclearâ€ù to usher through Trumpâ€™s Supreme Court nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and again with last weekâ€™s changes that slashed debate time on most nominees from 30 hours to two.Some say itâ€™s only a matter of time before the legislative filibuster which sets a 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation becomes the next to fall.Not everyone opposes such changes. On Friday presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. speaking at the National Action Network said if Democrats take control they should end the filibuster. She cited the filibusterâ€™s role in stopping anti-lynching and civil rights legislation.Even some Democrats see the hours of idle debate on lower-level picks as a waste of time.â€œOur obligation as senators is not to try to revive the old Senate but rather to figure out how we can build a new Senate that has its own customs and rules and institutional perogative that will work in a modern eraâ€ù said Sen. Brian Schatz D-Hawaii.But for now the Senate has a singular focus.Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas who faces re-election next year isnâ€™t sure confirmations will be enough for voters. But in divided Washington he sees few other options.â€œThe personnel business may be the whole gameâ€ù he said.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

On this date 101 years ago a Chicago couple named Hortense and William Bloomer welcomed their third child into the world a baby girl they named Elizabeth. William Bloomer was a traveling salesman for the Royal Rubber Co. and his work took the family to Denver briefly before they settled in Grand Rapids Mich. the place Elizabeth Bloomer would always consider her hometown even after she became a fixture in Washington D.C. -- and a widely admired first lady known as Betty Ford.Another presidential election is upon us it would seem -- the campaign season now lasts a full two years -- and in time we will focus on the personal lives of the nominees especially their significant others. The incumbent presidentâ€™s wife conspicuous for her beauty reticence and elegance is an immigrant. â€œI was born in Sloveniaâ€ù Melania Trump told Americans in her 2016 speech at the Republican National Convention. â€œA small beautiful and then-communist country in central Europe.â€ùShe was only the second first lady born abroad. The first was Louisa Catherine Adams wife of John Quincy Adams whose father was an American serving as U.S. consult in London.Isnâ€™t it interesting to think who will next don this amorphous mantle first worn by Martha Washington and now sported by Melania?The current Democratic Party field includes four female senators all married to men little-known in political circles a congresswoman from Hawaii and a male mayor from a small Midwestern city married to a man. The election of any of them would result in a historical first -- more than one in some cases. Thatâ€™s what makes history so interesting.A dozen years ago if I told you Cory Booker could be president you might have wondered if America was ready for an African-American president. Now if you think about Sen. Booker breaking the mold youâ€™d be wondering about something else: Namely when was the last time a bachelor moved into the White House? (It was Grover Cleveland in 1886).But hereâ€™s the rub: Whoever moves into that house with the president will be a woman or a man with distinctive gifts who will sacrifice his or her privacy and normalcy for a job without an official title and that doesnâ€™t pay a dime in salary. Yet if history is any guide that person will have untapped gifts and strengths that can be a source of inspiration to us all. A person like Betty Ford.

A lithe and active little girl Betty showed an early aptitude for dance which she later described as â€œmy happiness.â€ùShe was 16 when her father died from carbon monoxide poisoning and her passion became a source of income for the family. As the Great Depression took hold Betty Bloomer gave dance lessons to make ends meet and modeled at a Grand Rapids department store. She had bigger plans though and after graduation from high school she was accepted at the Bennington School of Dance in Vermont where she became a protÃ©gÃ© of famed choreographer Martha Graham whom she followed to New York.Reluctantly acceding to her motherâ€™s entreaties Betty returned to Grand Rapids and immersed herself in the community: opening her own dance studio working as a fashion coordinator in a local department store and dating a salesman named Bill Warren.In this last endeavor her mother's domineering personality backfired. As Betty explained in her 1978Â autobiography â€œMy mother and stepfather were not enthusiastic about Bill Warren which made him all the more alluring to me.â€ùBut a spirit of rebellion isn't enough to sustain a marriage and this one dissipated after five years. Then along came another suitor an All-American football player from Michigan just out of the Navy -- a handsome and ambitious fellow named Gerald R. Ford.Betty married Jerry Ford campaigned with him followed him to Washington after he was elected to Congress raised four kids with him and then followed him into the White House when he unexpectedly became president during the crucible of Watergate.As first lady Betty Ford openly endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment emerging as a then-unlikely prototype: Republican mother and feminist. And if some White House aides preferred her to be a little less outspoken the president wouldnâ€™t hear of it.Shortly after becoming first lady Betty discovered a lump in her right breast. By openly confronting the cancer and the ensuing mastectomy she helped de-stigmatized a disease that women of her generation often hid setting an example that has almost certainly saved and prolonged the lives of untold numbers of American women.An even greater challenge awaited. A year after they left the White House for California -- just before Bettyâ€™s 6birthday -- the Ford family did an intervention: Her twin addictions to alcohol and pain medication were killing her her family insisted and it was killing them to watch it.Betty checked into the Long Beach Naval Hospital with its anti-dependency program a stint that she credited with saving her life. In gratitude she immersed herself in the issue. She spoke about it publicly as was her wont and launched the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage California.â€œShe was a great liberatorâ€ù presidential scholar Richard Norton Smith said at her 2011 funeral. â€œShe not only liberated women she liberated us from the crippling limits of labels. Mrs. Ford was the feminist next door a free spirit with a dress code. Above all she was a wife and mother.â€ùâ€œShe had so many contributions so many lives she changed for the better and even saved by her example and her effortâ€ù added Lynne Cheney. â€œShe not only became her own woman but showed many others how to do the same.â€ùSteve Ford's remembrances that day induced both tears and laughter among the mourners especially when he described his mother's disbelief when he confided to her his own alcoholism.â€œYou can't be in denialâ€ù he told her. â€œYouâ€™re like Betty Ford. You're the poster child for this thing!â€ùThose tributes were delivered at the church where she and Jerry Ford had been married nearly 63 years earlier. Her Christian faith was deep and she was ready to go to the other side as she had told her children. Referring to their father whoâ€™d passed away in 2006 Betty said she wanted to be reunited â€œwith my boyfriend.â€ùCarl M. Cannon is the Washington Bureau Chief for RealClearPolitics.

After 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male Voters | RealClearPoliticAfter 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male VoterAfter 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male VoterAfter 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male VoterVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...UPPER ST. CLAIR TOWNSHIP Pa. (AP) â€” When he moved to Pennsylvania about five years ago it was a coin toss which party Brian Heitman would register with.Since Donald Trumpâ€™s election in 2016 Heitman who is 42 and white has become a reliable Democrat. Last week he voted for the Democratic candidate in a special state Senate election in Pittsburghâ€™s affluent southern suburbs.â€œA decade ago I probably wouldnâ€™t have even noticed this election was happeningâ€ù Heitman said â€œbut Iâ€™m making a point in voting in every one I can nowadays.â€ùThe Democratsâ€™ 2020 presidential primary may feature a historically diverse field of women and minorities but in some ways it is testing how the party appeals to white men such as Heitman. Many Democratic politicians went into the last presidential campaign cycle taking little account of those voters and banked on a coalition of women and minorities to carry them to victory. Trumpâ€™s victory proved that thinking wrong. Many in the party are determined now not to make the mistake again.Thatâ€™s left Democrats wondering whether the nominee should be someone who can cut deep into Trumpâ€™s base picking off large numbers of working-class whites whether itâ€™s enough to win over affluent college-educated suburban men and whether party is moving to far left to win them both.â€œThe white male vote is indispensable itâ€™s a part of any winning coalitionâ€ù said Democratic pollster Ronald Lester who worked for Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign in 2016. He noted that successful national Democrats perform well with white men and that includes Barack Obama whose strength among white men in the Rust Belt helped fuel his White House victories in 2008 and 2012.Several candidates have jumped in with their own suggestions of how to do that.Former Vice President Joe Biden who hasnâ€™t said whether he is running spoke to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in an appearance Friday that seemed designed to show how he could win back white working-class voters. Biden said some of his â€œsophisticated friendsâ€ù donâ€™t understand the need to treat laborers with respect.â€œHow the hell do we get to the place where a lot of you think the rest of the country doesnâ€™t see you or know you?â€ù Biden asked the mostly male crowd.When Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio announced his campaign earlier in the week he said his more centrist approach could appeal to working-class voters like those in his district which embodies the Rust Belt terrain that Trump won.Sen. Amy Klobuchar D-Minn. said her no-frills style has delivered white Midwestern voters before. Former Rep. Beto Oâ€™Rourke D-Texas uses his star appeal that helped him in Texasâ€™ well-educated suburbs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has said his economic populism will bring rural white voters back to the Democratic fold.Polling makes clear why Democratic are searching for the right messenger.White men make up typically make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018 41 percent of them voted for Democrats according to AP VoteCast a survey of the national electorate. While Democratsâ€™ strength among women won headlines and was often credited with Democratsâ€™ strong showing white men also moved to the Democrats column. VoteCast showed Democrats won the votes of 46% of white male college graduates a figure that has given some in the party hope.â€œThe revolt in these suburban districts wasnâ€™t just about white women it was also about white menâ€ù said Anna Greenberg a Democratic pollster advising the campaign of former Gov. John Hickenlooper D-Colo. â€œJust as thereâ€™s been a movement of white college-educated women thereâ€™s been a movement of white college-educated men.â€ùThat shift is part of a long-term trend.According to the American National Election Survey white men without college degrees have consistently supported the GOP over the past two decades while those with degrees â€” roughly one-fifth of the 2018 electorate â€” have increasingly moved toward Democrats. In 1996 when President Bill Clinton overwhelmingly won re-election he only received 36% of the votes of white male college graduates according to ANES. Hillary Clinton lost her race in 2016 but won 43% of them.Strategists generally find that college-educated white men are more moved by social issues and Trumpâ€™s violations of political norms while those without degrees are more concerned about economic issues and like candidates who may shake up the establishment. In Pennsylvania Democrats have gained ground among both groups since Trumpâ€™s election but some see the college-educated cohort as the most promising.Democrats picked up three U.S. House seats in Pennsylvania in November flipping suburban districts while also easily defending a U.S. Senate seat and the governorâ€™s mansion.â€œThe current coalition â€” urban suburban women and these college-educated males â€” will likely put Pennsylvania back in the Democratic columnâ€ù said Mike Mikus a veteran Democratic strategist who lives in the affluent suburbs of the 37th state Senate district.Trump won the traditionally Republican district by 6 percentage points in 2016. But after its Republican state senator was elected to Congress in November Democrats targeted the seat. They counted on flipping its educated populace of lawyers consultants and doctors who fill its colonial-style houses and shopping centers that spill over the ridgelines outside Pittsburgh.â€œThere are college-educated men who have at least temporarily put their Republican Party membership card in their pocket for a whileâ€ù Mikus said of his neighbors. But he warned these new Democratic voters may only be willing to tolerate so much in a party swinging to the left. â€œThey are somewhat conservative. They donâ€™t like paying a lot of taxes.â€ùAlfred Schnabel is one of them. The 42-year-old business analyst has kept his GOP registration but feels unwanted in either party. He is turned off by Trump and wary of Democratic presidential hopefuls such as Sanders.â€œThere seems to be a push to go super-progressiveâ€ù he said of Democrats.Still Schnabel volunteered for a local Democratic legislative candidate last year because he was infuriated at his state representativeâ€™s criticism of gay people and his frustration at the GOP outweighs his concerns about Democrats. He chalks up his ability to evolve politically to his education.â€œGoing to college I met people who were gay people from other culturesâ€ù Schnabel said. â€œThat stayed with me.â€ùMike Wessell is still a registered Republican but he was comfortable at the victory party last Tuesday night for the Democrat Pam Iovino who won the state Senate race comfortably.â€œIâ€™m not happy with the way President Trump has been running the country or his ideologyâ€ù said Wessell a corporate lawyer. He cited Trumpâ€™s immigration stance and denial of climate science.Wessell worked on the campaign of Conor Lamb the Democrat whose special election victory last year in a congressional district that overlaps with the 37th presaged Democratsâ€™ new strength in the state. He even appeared in an ad for Democratic Sen. Bob Caseyâ€™s re-election campaign later that year with his wife who is an active Democrat.Wessell is also wary of Sanders but he knows he wonâ€™t be voting Trump in 2020. Heâ€™s still hanging onto his Republican registration though.â€œI havenâ€™t given up on my partyâ€ù Wessell said as a roomful of Democrats cheered their latest win.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
"Enforcement Trumps a Border Wall | RealClearPoliticEnforcement Trumps a Border WalEnforcement Trumps a Border WalEnforcement Trumps a Border WalVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- During the two years when Democrats controlled the Oval Office Senate and House President Barack Obama squandered a major opportunity.He failed to push for a vote on a DREAM Act which would create a path to citizenship for qualified undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors. That matter was left for a vote in the lame-duck Congress; and that vote proved to be a gesture as the Democratic Senate failed to garner the needed 60 votes. America will never know how it might have ended if Obama had put his back into it.Ever since Obama's failure to push for this key promise of his 2008 campaign remains an object of contempt among conservatives -- who presume Democrats preferred to dangle the issue through the 2012 election and gin up resentment among Latino voters.With President Donald Trump's failure to push Republicans to change immigration laws when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress in 2017 and 2018 Trump may find himself in that same corner of shame.With 1 million or so undocumented migrants expected to cross the southwest border this year Trump's commitment to building his signature border wall doesn't seem to be doing the trick and he hasn't focused on measures that actually could improve the nation's immigration machinery.When Trump first got into office a big drop in southwest border apprehensions suggested his anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric had such a chilling effect that his promised wall might be superfluous. But then the numbers began to climb.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently argued that a law which prevents immigration officials from promptly returning minors from the so-called Northern Triangle countries and a court decision that limits how long the government can hold minors serve as loopholes that ""create a functionally open border.""That's why Mark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies always has argued that changing immigration law and enforcement would be far more effective than building a wall -- not that he's opposed to spending on a wall.Trump's push for the wall shows that he is working to keep to his 2016 campaign promise: But it really can't do much to discourage economic migrants who ultimately would not qualify for asylum but nonetheless believe they will be able to get into the United States through a port of entry.That's the problem with Trump's beloved wall. It may resonate with his base but it won't bring about the changes the base wants.And it's hard to get Republicans -- many of whom do not share Trump's view on illegal immigrants -- to die on a hill for a big-ticket item which the public opposes and politicians doubt will work.Krikorian doesn't think it's too late for Trump to switch his focus to changing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act so that federal officials can send undocumented minors who don't qualify for asylum back to non-contiguous countries the same way that they can return minors from Mexico and Canada.Could such a measure make it through the Democratic House? Not now but that could change if the flow of migrants through Mexico continues at such dangerous levels.""Politically it is essential for the Republicans to make it clear that [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer are the reason we have this border disaster"" said Krikorian. ""They are playing the part of [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel in inviting an unlimited number of people to come to the United States.""Krikorian believes that the GOP Senate should put its efforts on reworking immigration law so that it doesn't encourage border chaos.It doesn't help when Trump says as he did Friday morning that he wants to ""get rid of the whole asylum system."" It was another act of verbal self-sabotage that showed an executive ready to bar not only economic migrants but also refugees fearing for their lives.The week's antics with the president's since-retracted threats of closing the border with Mexico only reinforce a portrait of an executive who hasn't focused on a goal -- reducing illegal immigration -- so much as on winning.So Trump claimed victory Friday morning because Mexico has done a better job of enforcing its southern border under his threat. Does anyone think that will last when the mercurial president takes his eye off the ball?I get how the Trump base cheers on the president's ability to drive the left crazy with his rhetoric: But it's not going to fix a humanitarian crisis.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Trump opponents have lied about these â€œanimalâ€ù comments almost as often as they have propagated the totallyCharlottesville hoax the myth that he called neo-Nazi supremacists â€œfine people.â€ùThe extremist Oâ€™Rourke clearly disagrees vehemently with Trump on U.S. border sovereignty even arguing to tear down alreadybarricades. While his open-borders fantasies represent awful policy he at least displays honesty in publicly staking out his highly unpopular view.Â  But he also delves into demonization comparing Trump and border enforcement to the most evil regime of modern history one that systemically slaughtered millions of people.Sadly Oâ€™Rourke finds much company in this ugly pattern of Nazi analogizing among Trump critics.Â  For example former CIA Director Michael Hayden tweeted out a picture of the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp with theâ€œother governments have separated mothers and children.â€ùÂ  MSNBCâ€™s Donny Deutsch expanded the condemnation not only impugning Trump and our Homeland Security agents but also the 63 million Americans who voted for the president.Â  Deutschâ€œMorning Joeâ€ù viewers that â€œif you vote for Trump then you the voter -- you not Trump -- are standing at the border like Nazis.â€ùIt is really beneath decency to debate these accusations on their substance though I will point out that Trump ironically is the closest America has ever come to a Jewish president.Â  No national political leader in our country deserves such ignorant insults and certainly not a man who shares Shabbat with his own grandchildren and wasby Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that â€œIsrael has never had a better friend than you.â€ùEven more importantly cavalier comparisons like Oâ€™Rourkeâ€™s denigrate the ghastly sufferings of the millions massacred by Hitler and his henchmen.Â  Throwing around Nazi references to disparage rivals over policy prescriptions cheapens the sacredness of the true horrors of the Shoah.Â  Edna Friedberg a historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museumthat politicians and media figures â€œcasually use Holocaust terminology to bash anyone or any policy with which they disagree.â€ùMoreover such vile analogies disrespect the honor of Americaâ€™s veterans who led the alliance that toppled the wicked Nazi menace.Â  Hundreds of thousands of young Americans perished across an ocean to dismantle fascism.Â  American military cemeteries dot that continent today and remind us of the price our country paid to smash oppression.Â  Thereâ€™s truth in the aphorism that â€œpolitics ainâ€™t bean-bagâ€ù and we should all welcome a vigorous debate on controversial ideas such as illegal immigration.Â  But we should also all agree to refrain from comparing political rivals to the worst murderous monsters in history.Steve Cortes is a contributor to RealClearPolitics and a CNNÂ  political commentator.

Defending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free Speech | RealClearPoliticDefending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free SpeecDefending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free SpeecDefending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free SpeecVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Many in the United States worry about the erosion of democratic norms. Too few however exhibit concern for the steady deterioration over the last half century of the essential democratic norm of free speech.True the United States remains an exceptional experiment in free and democratic self-government. Of all the Western-style liberal democracies the nation â€œconceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equalâ€ù â€” as Lincoln put it in 1863 at Gettysburg â€” is grounded in the oldest written constitution sustains the largest economy enjoys the greatest diversity possesses the largest capacity for projecting force around the world and shoulders the most extensive responsibility for preserving the freedom and openness of the international order. Yet the increasing hostility of influential segments of its population to free speech â€” not least speech that affirms American exceptionalism â€” shows the United States to be in an unwelcome respect all-too-similar to fellow Western liberal democracies.The growing scorn for free speech in the United States â€” on campuses in Silicon Valley and Hollywood and in human resource departments and on corporate boards of all sorts of commercial enterprises â€” is on a collision course with the U.S. Constitution. Free speech is inscribed in the First Amendment following religious freedom and followed by freedom of the press and â€œthe right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.â€ùIts position in the text of the First Amendment symbolizes free speechâ€™s indissoluble connection to religious liberty and political liberty. One can neither worship (or not worship) God in accordance with oneâ€™s conscience nor persuade and be persuaded by fellow citizens if government dictates orthodox opinions and punishes the departure from them. Indeed the more authorities â€” whether formally through the exercise of government power or informally through social intolerance â€” prescribe a single correct view and demonize others the more citizens lose the ability to form responsible judgments and defend the many other freedoms that undergird human dignity and self-government.In the mounting hostility toward free speech within its borders the United States is not alone argues Andrew A. Michta in The American Interest. â€œDemocracies across the West are at an inflection point on free speechâ€ù he contends inThe Rise of Unfreedom in the Westâ€œand itâ€™s not clear which way things will go on this issue in the next 20 or 30 years.â€ùThe problem is manifold. â€œIn some cases ostensibly liberal governments have already made moves to police and suppress what they deem unacceptable speech; in others rigid political binaries have threatened to crowd out traditions of free inquiry and debateâ€ù Michta writes. â€œAll too often it seems not to matter what is said in an argument but rather who says it and how it was said.â€ùThe dean of the College of International and Security Studies at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies Michta grounds his dire diagnosis in concrete empirical evidence. Barely a quarter â€œof American adults believe they have true freedom of speech.â€ù Ninety percent of American universities censor speech or maintain policies that could authorize administrators to engage in censorship. In 2017 Germany enacted a law that obliges social media networks to be more â€œdiligent in policing â€˜hate speechâ€™ on their platforms.â€ù The next year France adopted a similar law. A substantial plurality of British voters in 2018 believed that people do not feel free to express their opinions on â€œimportant issues.â€ù And an annual report to the Council on Europe concludes that press freedom in Europe is in Michtaâ€™s words â€œmore fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War.â€ùIn both American and European societies according to Michta the tyranny of public opinion not only dictates what one may not say but also decrees what one must affirm. In both societies ideological litmus tests govern public discourse. The notion that lively give-and-take is the route to public consensus is fading.Elite opinion in the West Michta maintains not only leans left but seeks to silence the right. For much of the academic media and political establishments progressive opinions glow with righteousness while viciousness and ignorance indelibly stain conservative convictions.Cultural and political elites besmirch caring for oneâ€™s own nation as xenophobia. They fervently embrace globalization. They trumpet their commitment to save the planet while pressing for impossibly expensive and utterly unworkable environmental measures. They revile the popular desire to preserve traditional morality and the nationâ€™s inheritance even as they take for granted ordinary peopleâ€™s humanitarian conscience.The Westâ€™s descent into unfreedom argues Michta stems from the aggressive promulgation of ideas at odds with liberty and limited government. In the 1960s a critical mass of university professors used their tenured positions not merely to argue for but to institutionalize the belief that to achieve a just society it was necessary to sweep aside the fundamental principles and institutions of liberal democracy.Over the last 20 years the neo-Marxist students â€” and students of the students â€” of the â€™60s generation have intensified attacks on free speech. Neo-Marxist thinking replaces the proletariat with a bevy of identity-based groups whose claim to authority arises from their success in portraying themselves as victims of bias and oppression which they maintain are deeply embedded within the West. Like Marxâ€™s proletariat â€” or those bourgeois intellectuals whom Marx declared would break from their class and speak on the proletariatâ€™s behalf â€” the neo-Marxists assert that by virtue of their grievances they have acquired a monopoly on the truth.The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe 30 years ago and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that followed argues Michta â€œcarried a hidden threatâ€ù that further damaged the Westâ€™s commitment to free speech. The great victory of democracy and freedom in the Cold War over communist totalitarianism convinced Western elites that they were uniquely suited to bring democracy and freedom as they uniquely interpreted it to the entire globe.This conceit had perverse domestic ramifications. According to Michta it â€œcontained within it the seeds of arguably the greatest peril the West has ever confronted: the ideological certitude â€” not just on the Left â€” that we had cracked the code of the human condition and could get on with the work of perfecting both the individual and society.â€ù Ideological certitude hardened at the very moment that communismâ€™s defeat deprived the West of â€œa living exampleâ€ù of the costs of social engineering on a mass scale. â€œAnd so at its moment of triumphâ€ù writes Michta â€œthe West fell victim to a post-Enlightenment delusion of the perfectibility of man.â€ùThat delusion fuels the self-consuming scorn many intellectuals in the United States as well as in Europe direct at the principles of liberal democracy. At universities Americaâ€™s founding promise of individual freedom and equality under law is often treated as irredeemably tainted by racism and sexism colonialism and imperialism. In some cases free speech is placed on the list of â€œincorrect phrasesâ€ù that ought not be uttered because it belongs among the â€œimpure thoughtsâ€ù of which minds must be cleansed.In light of long-term trends those who care about the erosion of democratic norms in the United States â€” and who believe that that the United States can serve as a model to fellow liberal democracies â€” would do well to focus their energies on upholding the constitutional requirements of free speech cultivating tolerance and learning to benefit from a diversity of opinion.Peter Berkowitz is the Tad and Dianne Taube senior fellow at the Hoover Institution Stanford University.

"Democrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the Wealthy | RealClearPoliticDemocrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the WealthDemocrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the WealthDemocrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the WealthVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Democrats often complain that tax cuts primarily benefit â€œthe richâ€ù but apparently they only think itâ€™s a problem when rich conservatives get a tax break because theyâ€™re outraged that President Trumpâ€™s tax cuts scaled back a generous subsidy enjoyed by well-off taxpayers in liberal states.A key provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a new cap on the so-called State and Local Tax (â€œSALTâ€ù) Deduction which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes on their federal tax return. This provision forces taxpayers in low-tax states such as Florida and Texas to effectively subsidize those in high-tax states such as New York and California.For years blue-state Democrats have been able to raise state income and property taxes far higher than voters might normally tolerate. Thatâ€™s because the SALT deduction softened the impact for taxpayers in those states particularly for the rich campaign-donor class. Since the SALT deduction only applies to taxpayers who itemize their returns its benefits naturally accrue to those in the highest income bracket.There was previously no limit to how much taxpayers could deduct through SALT but even though the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped the deduction at $10000 almost 93 percent of American taxpayers will be unaffected. Itâ€™s likely that fewer taxpayers will elect to take advantage of SALT since the law also doubled the standard deduction but about 11 million of the highest-earning Americans living in high-tax states are seeing their federal income tax liabilities increase.Itâ€™s curious that liberals who criticized Trump so vociferously for â€œcutting taxes on the wealthyâ€ù are so upset by an element of the tax reform plan that merely takes away a tax break enjoyed disproportionately by the wealthy.Take New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for instance. His state has some of the highest tax rates in the country yet it is nonetheless facing a $2.3 billion budget deficit. Cuomo is blaming the changes to the SALT deduction saying that wealthy New Yorkers are now shifting their assets to other states or utilizing tax shelters to avoid the stateâ€™s punitive taxes.It turns out that without low-tax states paying a share of their taxes rich New Yorkers and Californians have discovered that it makes more sense to relocate. I certainly did. California where I used to live has a top marginal income tax rate of 13.3 percent. Tennessee where I hang my hat now has none â€” at least on regular income. The barbeque is better here too!In Cuomoâ€™s case most of his wealthy New Yorker donors were probably wintering in Florida anyway. Bad luck for him that Florida doesnâ€™t have a state income tax either because if they start lining up for Florida driverâ€™s licenses in any significant numbers itâ€™s going to bankrupt the Empire State.Most of the high earners left in these predominately coastal liberal strongholds have stuck around mainly because the SALT deduction gave them a hefty discount on their state taxes. In New York for instance the average SALT deduction was $22000 before the reform. That money came straight out of the pot that pays for national defense interstate transport national parks and all the other federally funded services that Americans depend on.Donald Trumpâ€™s historic tax reform has put an end to all of that and Democrats are up in arms. Four high-tax states are even suing to get their money back arguing that the federal government has a responsibility to provide lavish tax breaks to their richest residents.Next time you hear Democrats complain about â€œtax cuts for the richâ€ù remember that theyâ€™re the same ones who are going to the mat to protect tax breaks for wealthy liberals at the expense of middle-class Americans in low-tax states.Andy Puzder was chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants following a career as an attorney.

Biden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNN | RealClearPoliticBiden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNBiden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNBiden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Former Vice President Biden has been making headlines this week as his potential presidential campaign gears up but surely not the kind he was hoping for. Following Lucy Floresâ€™ claims that Bidenâ€™s touching of her in 2014 made her deeply uncomfortable more women have comewith similar concerns and Bidenâ€™s â€œhands onâ€ù style of greeting has become a political meme. Some Democratic-leaning newshave notably come to Bidenâ€™s but what has TV coverage of the story as a whole looked like?The timeline below shows the total percentage of weekly airtime on CNN MSNBC and Fox News combined that mentioned Biden since June 2009 using data from the Internet Archiveâ€™s. The past week has seen the second-most television news coverage of him over the past decade trailing only his 2012 reelection.Looking at the past two weeks by channel all three initially covered the Flores allegations but CNN and MSNBC quickly moved on. Fox News on the other hand has continued to devote significant attention to the story. Since Flores spoke up on March 29 Fox News has spent almost as much time on the story as the other two channels combined.The tremendous discrepancy in coverage can be seen most starkly in the graph below which tallies the total airtime devoted by each station since March 29 to the Robert Mueller and Biden stories. MSNBC has spent 3.2 times as much time on Mueller as it has Biden with CNN spending 2.3 times as much airtime. Fox News on the other hand has paid almost equal time to both stories.Even two weeks after Barrâ€™s release of key conclusions of the Mueller report there has not been a single day in which the Biden story received more airtime on MSNBC than the Mueller story and Biden bested Mueller for just a single day on CNN. It seems MSNBC in particular is working to keep the Mueller storyPutting this all together it is notable that in the #MeToo era the reckoning over a powerful politicianâ€™s uncomfortable interactions with women has not drawn more attention. CNN and MSNBC have largely downplayed the Biden allegations preferring to focus their time on the Mueller investigation while Fox News has granted both stories nearly equal airtime.If #MeToo allegations against one of the most prominent Democratic contenders canâ€™t break through the news cycle on CNN and MSNBC and with prominent Democrat Justin Fairfax withstanding his own #MeTooin Virginia it raises the question of whether #MeTooâ€™s role in the 2020 election cycle may be fading.RealClear Media Fellow Kalev Leetaru is a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber &amp; Homeland Security.

"Sanders and California; PC at Stanford; Quote of the Week | RealClearPoliticSanders and California; PC at Stanford; Quote of the WeeSanders and California; PC at Stanford; Quote of the WeeSanders and California; PC at Stanford; Quote of the WeeVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Good morning itâ€™s Friday April 5 2019. At the end of each week I provide a historical quote (or two or three) and todayâ€™s come courtesy of Booker T. Washington born on this date in 1856 and an educator who founded Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute now Tuskegee University.Many years before the civil rights movement gained traction in post-World War II America Booker T. Washingtonâ€™s ideas for black empowerment had been eclipsed. In some ways it happened in his own lifetime. His focus on educating formerly enslaved blacks and their children in what was known then as the â€œindustrial artsâ€ù was challenged by W.E.B. Du Bois who accused Washington of minimizing the intellectual ambitions of African Americans.By 1919 only four years after Booker T. Washingtonâ€™s death followers of radical separatist leader Marcus Garvey were denouncing the â€œUncle Tomâ€ù ideas of accommodationists such as Washington. Fair enough although if weâ€™ve learned anything in the ensuing 100 years itâ€™s that the world needs vocational education -- today we might call them software coders -- in addition to intellectuals. Anyway Booker T. Washington said and wrote many other things with current resonance.â€œI think I have learnedâ€ù he wrote in his memoir â€œthat the best way to lift oneâ€™s self up is to help someone else.â€ùIn a 1909 speech about Abraham Lincoln to the Republican Club of New York City he expounded on this idea. â€œOf all forms ofthere is none that is so harmful and degrading as that form of slavery which tempts onebeing to hate another by reason of his race or colorâ€ù he said.Â â€œOne man cannot hold another man down in the ditch without remaining down in the ditch with him.â€ùThose are mere warmup pitches however. In a moment Iâ€™ll have this Fridayâ€™s Quote of the Week. First I'd point you to RealClearPolitics' which presents our poll averages videos breaking news stories and aggregated opinion columns spanning the political spectrum.

Washington was born on April 5 1856. In truth Washington never knew for sure the date -- or even the year -- of his birth. In itsof the man the New York Times thought 1858 was a more likely year. He never knew his father either. But this is the date on which Washington celebrated his birth and when we think of the intellectual and momentous debates that took place in black American intellectual life after the Civil War it behooves us to exhibit some grace to all those men and women who were determined to forge a way forward that would make life better for themselves and their descendants.Booker T. Washington paid homage to this idea himself in an introduction he wrote to a 1902 book called â€œâ€ù co-authored by two scholars one white one black. In the passage that follows from that introduction -- and this is my quote of the week -- please note that Washington uses the word â€œwithes.â€ù This is not a typo that was meant to be â€œwhites.â€ù A â€œwitheâ€ù is a now-obscure word that originally meant a tough vine as from a willow. In this context it means rope.â€œThe unprecedented leap the Negro made when freed from the oppressing withes of bondage is more than deserving of a high place in historyâ€ù he wrote. â€œIt can never be chronicled. The world needs to know of what mettle these people are built.â€ùCarl M. Cannon is the Washington Bureau Chief for RealClearPolitics. Reach him on TwitterLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Trump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller Reset | RealClearPoliticTrump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller ReseTrump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller ReseTrump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller ReseVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In the military they call it ""firing for effect.""An artillery battery is fired at a suspected target to see if the enemy moves out of hiding and how heavily the fire is returned. It's a way to quickly assess battle lines and enemy strength without too much reconnaissance but only works ifÂ it's worth giving away oneâ€™s ownÂ  position.Over the last week as Donald Trump has launched broadsides on health care and the borderÂ Republicans are increasingly describing the presidentâ€™s salvos in similar terms.Only in their view his go-it-alone approach and failure to coordinate on both the health care and border fronts resulted in friendly fire casualties causing Trump just days later to beat an awkward and hasty retreat weakening all Republicansâ€™ strategic positioning in the process.Always aggressively on the advance Trump is in the White House today precisely because he doesnâ€™t cede ground to opponents operating in constant combat mode. The bold forceful approach is something Democrats found lacking in President Obamaâ€™s all-too-sublime â€” sometimes even aloof â€” approach to political strategy and working with other party leaders and Capitol Hill.And there have been times in which Trump has successfully smoked out Democratsâ€™ weaknesses by tossing political grenades their way usually on Twitter after seeing reports on cable news. As David Marcus has Trump isnâ€™t just watching TV and surfing Twitter as critics assert; heâ€™s researching and influencing.â€œHe is seeing what attacks of his are landing and what attacks against himself he can expectâ€ù Marcus wrote giving the president credit for being his own comms director and dominating the political narrative like no politician before.For example after Nancy Pelosi disinvited Trump from the State of the Union while the government shutdown continued he grounded her Middle East trip literally sending the airport-bound speaker and her delegation home to unpack. The move was a burst from a political flamethrower to be sure and it set Twitter on fire â€“ with plenty of his supporters among those joining the fray.Whatâ€™s more even some of Trumpâ€™s biggest GOP critics who had been busy lighting him up over the shutdown took a moment to delight in the gutsy counterpunch.This past week was not one of those times. At a time when Trump and his base were celebrating the no-indictment conclusion to Special Counsel Robert Muellerâ€™s two-year investigation the president squandered his own reset: the opportunity to rally Republicans to his side and build a more united front heading into the 2020 campaign.The 400-page Mueller report which will be released soon will undoubtedly fill the headlines once again with Democrats arguing that the obstruction evidence and other details are far more damaging than Attorney General William Barr let on. The past two weeks were a short window of opportunity for uniting the party which many Republicans say was botched.As heâ€™s demonstrated time and time again Trump is skilled at tapping into public anger over the Washington status quo but less adept at channeling it. After all governing and building coalitions is dull tedious work.Instead of focusing on Democratsâ€™ internal conflicts their leftward lurch on socialism the improbable Green New Deal and late-term abortions which Republicans in Congress were working overtime to highlight this week Trump launched a foray on an issue â€“ health care -- Republicans had already tried and failed to wrest from Democrats and he created a new border-related crisis that divided his own party.The administration went on the Obamacare attack last week when the Justice Department joined a lawsuit to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act â€“ even the popular protections for pre-existing conditions. Trump then promised a GOP replacement plan before the 2020 election â€“ one he tasked Senate Republicans with formulating to make the GOP the â€œparty of health care.â€ùHis fellow Republicans collectively groaned. The Senate couldnâ€™t repeal and replace the ACA when it only had a third of sitting Republicans up for re-election leading into 2018 compared to Democrats. The GOP will have to defend nearly twice as many seats as Democrats in 2020 guaranteeing gridlock and division on the Republican side of the aisle on health care and other hot-button issues.It took a few days but Trump saw the light and publicly agreed that it would be better to work on health care after the election not before. Still the damage was done and the political seams were revealed for all to see -- and Democrats to attack which they have done with gusto.In fact when House Democrats on Wednesday brought a resolution to the floor condemning Trump for asking the courts to throw out Obamacare eight Republicans voted with them.Then came a new ultimatum over the border. Early this week Trump said that he was â€œ100 percentâ€ù certain he would shut down the U.S. border with Mexico to block a rising influx of immigrants crossing into the country illegally. And he renewed his threat to Congress.â€œIf we donâ€™t make a deal with Congress the borderâ€™s going to be closedâ€ù he told reporters in the Oval Office. â€œ100 percent.â€ùHis fellow party members immediately pushed back.As with the earlier government shutdown over funding a border barrier Sen. Majority Whip John Thune said he doesnâ€™t believe shutting the border does anything to force Democrats to the table on immigration reform or to help stop illegal immigrants from crossing into the country.â€œOne I donâ€™t think it accomplishes the purposeâ€ù he told RealClearPolitics. â€œIt forces people to the unsecured areas coming across but they are still going to be coming.â€œTwo it makes it very hard to conduct bilateral trade and thatâ€™s awfully important for agriculture and other sectors of the economy.â€ùThune however said he understands the presidentâ€™s frustrations with Democratsâ€™ intransigence on immigration reform which he called a â€œhuge crisis.â€ùMitch McConnell didnâ€™t even try to play along with the president. â€œClosing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thingâ€ù the Senate majority leader said although he stressed that he agrees with the president that there is â€œa border crisis.â€ùWhen Trump doubled down by deeming national security more important than trade administration officials who were obviously not consulted struggled to offer some reasonable solution. Larry Kudlow Trumpâ€™s chief economic adviser suggested to reporters that both national security and trade are â€œessentialâ€ù â€“ not one more than the other.He suggested that the administration was exploring the possibility of keeping one lane of trucking traffic open at the border to â€œhelp supply-chain issuesâ€ù â€“ but one can imagine the serpentine lines and truck-by-truck checks such a scenario would require.â€œIf you ask me the mechanics of it Iâ€™m not the guy but that is possible and that will help the supply-chain issuesâ€ù Kudlow said trying to change the subject to negotiations over the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement on trade.By Thursday the president had let Kudlow and other surrogates off the hook to find some type of workaround by backing off the immediate threat to close the border and instead turned to tariff threats. He said Mexico must step up its enforcement and over the next year must prove it is stopping the flow of drugs coming into the U.S.â€œIf Mexico doesnâ€™t give the help thatâ€™s okay. Weâ€™re going to tariff their cars coming in to the United States.â€ùIt was a second time in a week Trump decided to reverse course on an issue he had raised leading Republicans to publicly and privately grouse about getting caught without warning in the crossfire of the presidentâ€™s â€œfire for effectâ€ù impulses.Many congressional Republicans also decided to distance themselves from the administration by cutting off U.S. support for Saudi Arabiaâ€™s military campaign in Yemen. The House on Thursday approved a previously passed Senate measure to break U.S. ties with that conflict. The White House vowed to veto the bill.Even though he reversed course on his border threat Trump still plans to head to Calexico California on Friday to inspect a recently completed section of border wall. His supporters believe the pre-planned event will show him in a position of strength spotlighting action on his signature 2016 campaign promise. It will also highlight Democratsâ€™ refusal to address what President Obamaâ€™s homeland security secretary recently deemed an undeniable immigration crisis.Kudlow and other aides said Trumpâ€™s shutdown threat may have caused an intra-party skirmish but it got Mexicoâ€™s attention. The Mexican government in recent days has agreed to help prevent immigrants from crossing into the United States by adding more checkpoints and allowing people to remain in that country while seeking asylum.â€œWe want help from Mexico and by the way it appears we are getting more help from Mexico which is a good thing a great thingâ€ù Kudlow told reporters Wednesday.â€œThe Mexican government is doing better than some on the Hillâ€ù he added.Kudlow explained the threat as â€œan exclamation point that shows [Trumpâ€™s] seriousness. â€_ Heâ€™s flagging to the American people just how committed he is to restoring law and order down there.â€ùTrump before departing for California Friday again said he is looking at imposing an â€œeconomic penaltyâ€ù against Mexico in response to drug trafficking and boasted about the number of migrants Mexican authorities had apprehended in the last four days.â€œTheyâ€™re apprehending everybodyâ€ù he said. â€œItâ€™s never happened like that in 35 years.â€ùAfter a week of scrambling Trump appeared to be back on solid predictable ground and his fellow Republicans are no doubt thankful for the reprieve â€“ however long it lasts.Susan Crabtree is a veteran Washington reporter who has spent two decades covering the White House and Congress.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Brexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic Toll | RealClearPoliticBrexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic TolBrexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic TolBrexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic TolVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...DUBLIN -- One doesn't necessarily expect to find an advanced manufacturing operation in the Donegal Gaeltacht one of the last rural redoubts where the Irish language can be heard in everyday life. Yet there Irish Pressings is producing tooling and parts for the auto industry. Since it was founded the company has grown steadily even during the most brutal parts of the financial crisis.Irish Pressings planned to grow even bigger this spring because the company expected a major contract from Honda for one of its new models. News of the contract had prompted a weekend-long celebration -- followed by devastation in February when Honda announced that it was shutting the factory in England where the car was to be made. Honda said the decision wasn't Brexit-related but in 2018 an executive had detailed the company's concerns about problems that would be caused by Britain's leaving the European Union.Declan Ward Irish Pressings' managing director says his firm will be fine because its policy is not to spend money on expansion until a contract is firmly in hand. Nonetheless losing the Honda job was a blow to an employer in an area that desperately needs this kind of economic development.Much of the speculation about Brexit over the past few years has focused on how it would affect the British and Irish economies. Remainers have occasionally exaggerated just how bad it would be -- even if Britain crashes out of the EU with no agreement to organize its trade with other countries Britons are not going to be boiling up their shoes for dinner.That said a no-deal Brexit is likely to be disastrous enough. Josh Hardie deputy director general of the Confederation of British Industry estimates shipments through the Port of Calais Britain's gateway to Europe would fall by 50% in the immediate aftermath. For consumers that would mean shortages of certain goods and long queues. For businesses it would mean a major economic shock one that would of course eventually hit workers' paychecks. And while leaving the EU might not be fatal to London's place as a world financial center some job losses are inevitable. Last year Bank of America relocated to Dublin moving about 100 jobs from London to its Irish subsidiary.But that doesn't mean Ireland expects to do well out of Brexit. An Irish government study released last month estimated that a disorderly no-deal Brexit would cause job losses in the tens of thousands over the next decade in a country with a population of less than 5 million. Ireland sends most of its agricultural exports to Britain and much of the rest of its trade uses Britain as a land-bridge to the rest of Europe. A hard Brexit would be very hard on Ireland.And as Irish Pressings' experience suggests you don't actually have to wait for Brexit to see economic ripple effects across both sides of the Irish Sea. With Brexit says Ward ""The damage is already done. There's been a dramatic decline in car buying.""The uncertainty over the shambolic Brexit political process is making matters worse. Mark Sharkey the chief executive of the Cope a retail cooperative near Irish Pressings recalls starting to plan for a hard Brexit and asking his suppliers what they were doing. He says he was startled when they replied ""Very little"" but it was understandable. With everything in doubt how can you plan?Companies waiting to discover whether Britain is going to leave and how are withholding investment -- or steering investments elsewhere. And as Hardie told me ""Once a hundred-million pound investment has gone somewhere else it's not coming back."" And of course some of the follow-on investments that otherwise would have been made will instead flow toward the money's new home.But the changes taking place in the British economy aren't necessarily visible in the headline gross domestic product figures and that may actually be making things worse. If the uncertainty had crashed Britain into a recession politicians might have been forced to come to some orderly timely arrangement. But GDP grew at a rate of 1.4% in 2018 -- not stellar but not catastrophic either.Even more perversely the uncertainty has spurred some of the growth: British firms are building up their inventories in case a no-deal Brexit suddenly cuts off supplies. That has given the British economy lately a healthier glow than it merits. Even in an orderly Brexit or a canceled Brexit the glut of goods will depress output in future quarters.Eventually something will have to happen with Brexit and eventually Irish Pressings and British industry will muddle through; the Cope will cope. But every day that politicians dither is another day of damage to businesses -- and another day for firms to look beyond the British market toward places where the path forward seems clearer.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Iâ€™ll do one or the other. And probably start off with the tariffsâ€ù Trump said. He added later: â€œI donâ€™t think weâ€™ll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Mexico at 25 percent will be massive.â€ùIt was the latest seemingly sudden attempt at new leverage by a president struggling to solve what his administration has called a border â€œcrisis.â€ù And it was a dramatic departure for Trump who last week tweeted that he would close the border or large swaths of it this week unless Mexico immediately halted â€œALL illegal immigration coming into the United Statesâ€ù â€” a seemingly impossible task.Trump said at the time that he was â€œnot kidding aroundâ€ù and his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in a television interview Sunday that it would take â€œsomething dramaticâ€ù for Trump not to close down the crossings.Since then however White House advisers border city leaders and U.S. economists have warned that such a move would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border interrupting supply chains and boosting U.S. consumer prices on everything from avocadoes to autos.Trump in recent days has also backtracked on his push for Republicans to again take on health care and surprised his own education secretary by reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics.Those actions have only added to longstanding concerns about whether Trumpâ€™s words can be trusted. Trump who has long said his unpredictability is one of his greatest negotiating assets has also followed through with some of his most bombastic threats including forcing the countryâ€™s longest-ever government shutdown over border funding.Trump had already appeared to be easing off his border threat earlier this week. Though he said Tuesday all options remained on the table he shifted his goal posts calling on Congress to pass immigration legislation to avert a closure and praising the Mexican government for doing more to apprehend migrants traveling through the country from Central America â€” though itâ€™s unclear anything has changed.Marcelo Ebrard Mexicoâ€™s foreign relations secretary said Tuesday his government had not changed its policies. And on Thursday Mexicoâ€™s ambassador to the U.S. Martha Barcena told The Associated Press the country was working to make its own border â€œmore orderlyâ€ù but â€œmigration will never be stopped.â€ùJesus Seade the Mexican undersecretary for North America also brushed off the threat of new tariffs saying officials were â€œnot concernedâ€ù and noting the tariffs are not part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement that the countries have agreed to but not yet ratified.On Thursday Trump also threatened tariffs if Mexico doesnâ€™t halt the flow of illegal drugs across the border saying heâ€™d give the country â€œa one year warningâ€ù to comply.â€œBut if in a year from now drugs continue to pour in weâ€™re going to put tariffs onâ€ù he said adding: â€œI donâ€™t play games.â€ùAs for concerns his actions might interfere with the trade deal he fought for Trump said the border was â€œmore important to me than the USMCA.â€ùTrump has wide-ranging power to impose tariffs on national security grounds which he has repeatedly used as leverage against other countries. But the USMCA was worded to protect Mexico against auto tariffs based on national security concerns and trade lawyer Daniel D. Ujczo said those provisions are already in effect under a side letter.â€œIn short this is the exact scenario that the Mexican negotiating team predicted and secured protections from in the USMCAâ€ù he said. â€œMexico â€˜Trump-and-Tweet-proofedâ€™ its auto sectorâ€ù and the White House â€œwould need to get very creative to impose auto tariffs on Mexico.â€ùIn addition despite what Trump suggests Mexico China and other American trading partners donâ€™t pay U.S. tariffs directly. American importers pay the tariffs at the border and then must decide how much of the higher cost they can pass along to U.S. customers.Tariffs do squeeze the manufacturers who export to the U.S. from foreign countries by making their products more expensive in the United States. But there again that can hit U.S. companies such as General Motors which is a major car-maker in Mexico.Trump has been increasingly exasperated at his inability to halt the swelling number of migrants entering the U.S. including thousands who have being released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100000 arrests or denials of entry in March a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children who require extra care.The presidentâ€™s â€œpretty frustratedâ€ù said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas who spoke with Trump this week and offered to work with the administration â€œto try to come up with some more targeted ideasâ€ù including changes for remittances to Mexico. Trump suggested he work with the Treasury secretary on the idea Cornyn said.Trump has invoked other executive powers including declaring a national emergency in an effort to secure more money for his long-promised border wall. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed that measure.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats would file a lawsuit aimed at preventing Trump from â€œstealingâ€ù billions from federal programs and diverting the money to building barriers along the border.Administration officials had been studying ways to minimize the economic impact of a potential border closure in case Trump went through with his threat including keeping trucking lanes open or closing only certain ports.But even absent that extraordinary step delays at border stations have been mounting after some 2000 border officers were reassigned from checking vehicles to deal with migrant crowds.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White House | RealClearPoliticOhio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White HousOhio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White HousOhio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White HousVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...COLUMBUS Ohio (AP) â€” Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan jumped into the 2020 presidential race on Thursday portraying himself as a candidate who can bridge Democratsâ€™ progressive and working class wings to win the White House.Ryan 45 announced his primary bid on ABCâ€™s â€œThe View.â€ù He plans a kickoff rally on Saturday in downtown Youngstown where a big turnout by organized labor is expected.The congressman resisted being labeled a political centrist by the talk showâ€™s hosts who pointed out that heâ€™s a recreational hunter with past backing from the National Rifle Association. In 2015 he reversed his past opposition to abortion in favor of abortion rights.â€œIâ€™m a progressive who knows how to talk to working class people and I know how to get elected in working class districts because at the end of the day the progressive agenda is whatâ€™s best for working familiesâ€ù Ryan said.DuringÂ an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy PelosiÂ as House Democratic leader in 2016 Ryan criticized the party for supporting leadership that represents the U.S. coasts at the expense of the middle of the country.Ryan represents the district formerly held by the late Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant for whom he worked. The blue collar areaÂ swung strongly for Donald TrumpÂ over Hillary Clinton in 2016.Bringing those voters back into the fold will be critical in 2020 said Mahoning County Democratic Chairman David Betras. He said that Trumpâ€™s victory hinged on 77000 working class votes in four states and that he had a â€œnews flashâ€ù for the Democratic National Committee: â€œIâ€™m willing to bet weâ€™re going to win California and New York (with our current strategy) but can we win Michigan Pennsylvania Iowa Wisconsin and Ohio? Iâ€™m not so sureâ€ù he said.The president of the Mahoning-Trumbull AFL-CIO Labor Council Bill Padisak said many of the lifelong Democratic voters in the area who defected to vote for Trump a Republican would return to the Democratic Party for the right candidate.â€œIt seemed more like an anti-Hillary vote (in 2016)â€ù he said. â€œBut based on the presidentâ€™s performance a lot of people regret it. Theyâ€™re like â€˜No this wasnâ€™t what I wanted in a president.â€™â€ùThough the Iowa caucuses are still nine months away Ryan is getting a late start on theÂ grassroots fundraisingÂ that is necessary to qualify for the summer debate stages.The Democratic National Committee is limiting thoseÂ first two debatesÂ to 20 slots. To qualify candidates must reach 1% support in at least three reputable early state or national polls or collect contributions from at least 65000 donors with a minimum of 200 each in 20 states.Some Democratic donors are contributing to multiple candidates to help them make sure they donâ€™t miss out on the debates. But that threshold is no guarantee in such a wide field. Missing the debate stage â€” and the opportunity to notch a standout moment or two alongside better-known candidates â€” would almost certainly doom a longshot candidacy for someone like Ryan.Ryan has served in Congress since 2003. Before that he spent two years in the state Senate.Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said Ryan canâ€™t win.â€œYou can just add him to the long list of liberal candidates demanding government-run health care and it underscores how radical and out of touch this Democratic field truly isâ€ù he said.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
"White Supremacy Must Be Undone | RealClearPoliticWhite Supremacy Must Be UndonWhite Supremacy Must Be UndonWhite Supremacy Must Be UndonVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- The national debate on race -- which the president has made more angry and urgent with his racial demagoguery -- is hindered by imprecise language.Most whites do not feel personally guilty for America's long history of imposed white supremacy. A white man who has lost his job at the coal mine or the daughter of a recent Ukrainian immigrant probably does not regard himself or herself as privileged. And they are not likely to have an emotional investment in the debates over race that have dominated American history.For a certain kind of conservative this is the end of the story. The oppressors of blacks in the past are dead. Their grandchildren and great-grandchildren in this view can't be held responsible for sins they did not commit.America's racial dialogue is distorted by the use of the word ""guilt."" To most people guilt involves a conscious personal decision to engage in some wrong. But this situation is more complex. Whether they realize it or not white people in America benefit from centuries of enforced white dominance. And their current indifference helps perpetuate the social and economic advantages that have resulted.What is important is not the feeling of guilt -- though many of us might benefit from taking an honest inventory of our personal prejudices. What is important is a recognition that our economic and social systems have been massively rigged in favor of whites and that the unrigging is a continuing political responsibility.Examining American history for evidence of oppression is a disturbingly easy task. Even a skim reveals a thick layer of scum.The great rigging began about 400 years ago when around 20 slaves were brought to Jamestown. The white settlers wrote laws that placed slaves and indentured servants in different categories -- allowing poor whites to be slave overseers and permitting black slaves to be punished more harshly. Virginia's colonial government determined that baptism would not confer freedom on slaves -- effectively allowing some Christians to own other Christians. Across the colonies slavery began to be associated with skin color.Many Christians employed the Bible to defend slavery but in the late 18th century some Enlightenment science also purported to prove black racial inequality. The American Constitution did not recognize the full personhood of African Americans. One of the early acts of the new republic was to restrict citizenship to white males. In 1854 the California Supreme Court invoked a California state law that said ""no black or mulatto person or Indian shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of or against a white man."" In 1857 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that blacks have ""no rights which the white man was bound to respect.""Slavery itself involved physical and psychological violence on a massive scale designed to prevent men and women from considering and organizing opposition. Marriage and education were restricted or forbidden families were routinely separated and slaves could usually be beaten raped or killed with impunity.While slavery eventually ended economic and political oppression did not. White supremacy was written into Jim Crow laws and enforced by continued public and private violence. Voting rights were systematically denied. ""Sundown towns"" made it illegal for blacks to remain after dark. And nearly 4000 lynchings revealed the evil at the heart of dehumanization. Sometimes thousands of white men women and children would gather to watch the event. In some cases fingers of the victim were cut off as souvenirs. Unborn children were ripped out of wombs. Corkscrews were used to tear out flesh. Men and women were beaten and burned to death. And photographs of the victims were turned into postcards.The list continues. Redlining and restrictive covenants undermined black homeownership. Unions were permitted to lock nonwhites out of better jobs. Educational integration was resisted by segregation academies. Equal justice was resisted by white juries. And some churches gave their blasphemous blessing.In all this racism is not primarily a matter of human feelings. It is the systematic use of political economic social and religious structures to ensure white supremacy. And no response is serious that does not take the reform of structures seriously.This does not lead directly to a specific policy. Conservatives and liberals will naturally disagree about how to close the wealth gap between African Americans and whites. (The average wealth of white households is about seven times greater than that of black households.) But such inequality is not a matter of bad feelings. It was consciously and purposely built into institutions over centuries. And it must be consciously and purposely undone.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Will Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left? | RealClearPoliticWill Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left?Will Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left?Will Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left?Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Which of the two dozen or so Democratic presidential candidates is going to carry black voters next year? The answer to that question is likely to be identical to the answer to the question ""Which candidate is going to be the Democratic nominee and maybe the president?""For years black Americans have cast about 1 out of 4 votes in Democratic primaries. In 2016 they cast 71% of Democratic primary votes in Mississippi 61% in South Carolina 54% in Alabama 51% in Georgia 46% in Maryland 32% in North Carolina and Tennessee and 20 to 28% in Arkansas Florida Illinois Virginia New York Michigan Missouri and Ohio.Near-unanimous black support helped nominate and elect the last three Democratic presidents -- Jimmy Carter Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. It's near-unanimous because black voters have tended to vote solidly for one candidate over another in the primaries even against alternatives with serious claims on their support.Such solidarity in voting makes sense for people identifying as part of a distinct group suffering discrimination. For years political reporters have listened as black preachers avoiding outright endorsements called for ""unity."" Their congregations understood what they meant.Blacks have voted 85% or more Democratic in every presidential election since 1964; as well as in primaries for Jimmy Carter over Ted Kennedy in 1980; for Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988; for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008; and for Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016.If the impulse toward solidarity prevails again in 2020 it's not clear who will benefit. Joe Biden after eight years as the faithful vice president to the nation's first black president leads among black voters in current polls. But will he run?The two candidates with African ancestry Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have background atypical of descendants of antebellum American slaves. Harris' father is from Jamaica and Booker grew up in an affluent black suburb in New Jersey. But then Barack Obama's background was even more atypical: How many Americans grew up in Indonesia?Plus there are signs that black voters may not be behaving as monolithically as they used to. Exit polls in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries showed them favoring Clinton pretty unanimously in the South giving Sanders only 6 to 19% in former Confederate states. But in New York Pennsylvania five Great Lakes states and Missouri Sanders got between 26 and 32%; he carried three of them and came within 2 points of carrying two more.Chicago's mayoral election is another example of waning black solidarity. Although Tuesday's runoff was a contest between two black women neither had carried the city's 19 predominantly black wards in the nine-candidate Feb. 26 initial primary. Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot's electoral base was whites in upscale Lakefront wards and her appeal was not connected to race but a lack of entanglement with corruption-tinged insiders.Interestingly even on race-related issues white college graduates not blacks are now the most liberal segment of the Democratic electorate. As New York Times blogger Thomas Edsall notes more white liberals (79%) than blacks (60%) believe that racial discrimination is the main reason many blacks can't get ahead. Fully 32% of blacks say blacks who don't are mostly responsible for that.Black voters are generally more religious than whites and much more than white liberals; they cast the deciding votes against same-sex marriage in California in 2008 and opposed it in North Carolina in 2012 changing their minds only after then-President Barack Obama endorsed it a day later. Indeed blacks make up a large share of the diminishing number of Democratic primary voters labeling themselves as moderate or conservative.Black Democrats seem less likely than white college-graduate liberals to support and to identify as litmus tests positions unpopular with most general election voters like open-border immigration ninth-month abortions and the Green New Deal. Perhaps they will prevent ""woke"" white college graduates -- and a press almost entirely made up of this demographic -- from pulling the Party too far to the left to defeat a Republican incumbent whose job approval seems stuck around 45%.Or perhaps not. The Democratic Party from its Jacksonian foundation in 1832 has always been a coalition of out-groups of people not considered typical Americans. At their best they're a triumphant majority. At their worst they're a disorderly rabble. Which will they be in 2020? Black voters will have a big say in that.Michael Barone is senior political analyst forÂ  the Washington Examiner resident fellow at American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.Signup to receive email alertLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"2020: Socialist America or Trump's America? | RealClearPolitic2020: Socialist America or Trump's America?2020: Socialist America or Trump's America?2020: Socialist America or Trump's America?Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In the new Democratic Party where women and people of color are to lead and the white men are to stand back the presidential field has begun to sort itself out somewhat problematically.According to a Real Clear Politics average of five polls between mid-March and April 1 four white men -- Joe Biden Bernie Sanders ""Beto"" O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg -- have corralled 62 percent of all Democratic voters.The three white women running -- Senators Elizabeth Warren Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand -- have together a piddling 8 percent.The lone Hispanic candidate Julian Castro is at 1 percent.African American candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker fare better with Harris at 10 and Booker at 3.Who has raised the most money from the most contributors?Sanders is first with $18 million; Harris is next with $12 million; Beto is third with $9 million in 18 days; and ""Mayor Pete"" is fourth with $7 million.Warren Klobuchar and Gillibrand have yet to file reports.But the big takeaway from recent weeks is the sudden stunning vulnerability of the front-runner. Seven women have come forward to berate Biden for unwanted and offensive touching and crowding. Joe is on the defensive. Some in the #MeToo movement want him gone.He is also being slammed for decisions across his 36-year Senate career -- opposing busing for integration deserting Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas hearings supporting a racially discriminatory crime bill voting to authorize George W. Bush to take us into war in Iraq.And unkindest cut of all: Barack Obama's stony silence about Joe's candidacy.The most compelling case for the 76-year-old ex-vice president is that he can win back Trump's white working-class voters and return Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Democratic fold.Thus a major drop in Biden's polls could be terminal to his candidacy.If Biden can't guarantee a victory over Trump why go with Joe?Yet if he fades away as a candidate as he has done twice before who emerges as front-runner? The 77-year-old Socialist Bernie Sanders. If Joe fades Bernie and the comrades will have removed the last large roadblock to a socialist takeover of the national Democratic Party.And what would then happen if the Democrats simply held the House added three Senate seats and defeated Trump in 2020?An all-out effort to abolish the Electoral College that is integral to the historic compromise that created our federal Union. Puerto Rico and D.C. would become states giving Democrats four more Senators and making America a bilingual nation.A drive would be on to give 16-year-olds and convicted felons the right to vote in federal elections freezing Republicans out of power forever. A packing of the Supreme Court would begin by raising by six the number of justices and elevating liberal activists to the new seats.On the southern border where 100000 illegal migrants were apprehended in March Trump's wall would come down all peoples fleeing repression in Central America would be welcomed into the U.S. sanctuary cities would become the norm and ICE would be abolished.Open borders would be a reality along with amnesty for the 12 million-20 million people here illegally with a path to citizenship for all.It is impossible to see how the U.S. border would ever be secured.The Green New Deal would be enacted. Medicare for all. Free tuition for college students. Millennial college debts paid off by the government. Free pre-K schooling and day care. Guaranteed jobs for all. A guaranteed living wage. Repeal of the Reagan and Trump tax cuts. A re-raising of the corporate rate and a return of the top rate for individuals to 70 percent. New wealth taxes on the rich.With climate change seen as an existential planetary peril fossil fuel-powered energy plants -- coal oil natural gas -- would be phased out and a new national reliance on solar and wind begun.There would be reparations for slavery. Abortion on demand right up to birth for all women. Marijuana would be legalized. Harris has urged that prostitution sex work be legalized.How would the Green New Deal be paid for?Under ""modern monetary theory"" currency is a public monopoly for the government and unemployment is evidence that the monopoly is choking off the needed supply. So print the money necessary to get to rising wages full employment and a booming economy.To achieve Bernie Sanders' Socialist America the filibuster would have to be abolished easily done and the Constitution altered requiring the support of three-fourths of the states not so easy.Yet as of today the unannounced front-runner Joe Biden who is taking fire from many quarters appears to be the last man standing between Sanders Socialism and the Democratic nomination.Should Joe falter and fall Trump would be the nation's last line of defense against the coming of a Socialist America. For never-Trump conservatives the day of reckoning may be just ahead.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Zuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free Expression | RealClearPoliticZuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free ExpressioZuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free ExpressioZuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free ExpressioVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In a recent op-ed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg implored the state to get more involved in governing the internet. ""Every day we make decisions about what speech is harmful what constitutes political advertising and how to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks"" he said. ""These are important for keeping our community safe. But if we were starting from scratch we wouldn't ask companies to make these judgments alone.""For starters there's no such a thing as ""harmful speech."" There might be speech that offends us. There might be speech we disagree with. There's also speech that's inarguably ugly dishonest pornographic or despicable. Yet ""we"" allow these unpleasant words to go largely unregulated because we value the broader liberty of being able to offer opinions without government censors dictating which thoughts are acceptable.Then again if Zuckerberg wants to rid his platform of this ""hate speech"" no one is stopping him. Facebook allegedly employs a number of new mechanisms to achieve this very task. Good luck.But Zuckerberg claims that ""we"" as society have a special responsibility to facilitate his efforts to keep people ""safe"" from reprehensible rhetoric. We have no such obligation. Facebook already offers users the ability to block or ignore accounts they find distasteful. If they don't like how Facebook is governing speech and interactions they can quit.What Zuckerberg's plan does however is undermine competition. If a company like Facebook sets speech codes that are too stifling for users another innovator will jump into the gap and create a platform that offers consumers what they seek. While I assume free political expression isn't the predominate concern of most social media users it does exist. When government sets a ""baseline"" for what's acceptable there's no longer any competition for open debate.Worse deliberation over free expression would be moved to the political arena where the influence of scaremongering officials ideologues and rent-seeking tech corporations like Twitter Facebook and Google would dominate decisions.""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech and frankly I agree"" Zuckerberg writes. It's true that the skewed manner in which social media companies regulate political speech is already hurting them. Many conservatives have rightly grumbled about the double standards employed by social media giants. Yet do they really believe handing over Facebook's speech codes to censors is going to yield better results for open debate in the long run? Do they not remember that the Citizens United decision was the result of bureaucrats attempting to ban political speech? Do they not remember what how easy was for IRS officials tasked as arbiters of political speech to abuse their power? Have any of them seen a state's civil rights commission in action?Empowering political appointees to codify the meaning of ""hate speech"" on the internet would surely result in mission creep and a push to make unpopular topics off-limits -- things like ""transphobia"" or ""Islamophobia"" come to mind but there are an array of other topics on both sides of the ideological divide.Moreover Zuckerberg wants to institute these plans in ""common global framework."" Well Vladimir Putin recently signed a bill that makes it a crime to ""disrespect"" the state and spread ""fake news."" France who Zuckerberg says is already working with Facebook has passed hate-speech laws that allow the banning of political content. The same is true for many other nations. And let's not forget fully authoritarian nations like China. Are those the countries that Zuckerberg trusts to assist the United States in instituting a framework for acceptable internet speech?Further Zuckerberg contends that we need speech codes to protect our ""elections."" There's nothing wrong with our elections -- other than Donald Trump's victory rankling Democrats. There are of course already laws that make it illegal for Facebook to accept money from foreign nations attempting to inject themselves into U.S. elections.In a disorderly and widely accessible internet it is impossible to stop them every time. Any crackdown on alleged ""fake news"" -- one of the evils of the internet according to Zuckerberg -- can easily be manipulated to target inconvenient speech. If the Russian collusion episode should teach us anything it's that fake news isn't always what it seems to be. And liberals might note that Trump's definition of ""fake news"" doesn't mesh with their own either.In the end having an occasional amateurish fake news piece drop into your social media feed is far preferable to having a censor deciding what constitutes appropriate news.Like every crony capitalist who's ever tried to get government to do his job for him Zuckerberg is attempting to both extricate himself from the responsibility of running his site and attempting to hurt the competition. That's not surprising. In this case however the consequences go beyond mere rent-seeking.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist. Follow him on TwitterLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Biden and the Problem of Touch | RealClearPoliticBiden and the Problem of ToucBiden and the Problem of ToucBiden and the Problem of ToucVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...""If I profane with my unworthiest han""This holy shrine the gentle sin is this:""My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stan""To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.""-- William Shakespeare. ""Romeo and Juliet"" Act I SceneJoe Biden's explanatory video in response to stories of his sometimes overly exuberant physicality was well-played. He seemed relaxed sincere unscripted and above all not supine.The matter of physical touch is well touchy. One person's affectionate hug is another's creepy unwelcome invasion of personal space. Biden does seem to have stepped over the line at times. Free advice: Inhaling the aroma of a woman's hair and kissing her head when you've just met is not recommended. But most of the time it seems that Biden's hugs shoulder rubs and Eskimo kisses were well-received. He is physically demonstrative with women but also with other men and particularly with children.""Social norms are changing"" Biden acknowledged assuring viewers that he ""gets it."" But before we close the books with the #MeToo-inflected conclusion that touching is ""problematic"" we might want to consider some other evidence currently in the news that suggests we aren't touching enough.According to the General Social Survey the huge study of America's cultural patterns that has been conducted for decades Americans are having less sex now than they did 30 years ago. Some of that is the consequence of an aging population. But even among Americans aged 18-29 nearly a quarter reported that they had been celibate for the previous year compared with 14 percent in 1989.It is well-known that married adults have more sex than single divorced or even cohabiting adults and that married people report higher levels of both sexual satisfaction and happiness. The trend away from marriage thus virtually guarantees that more people will be isolated and vulnerable to the diseases of loneliness which include drug and alcohol abuse. Marriage rates are plunging for those with only a high school degree or some college and though college graduates have high rates of marriage they tend to marry later in life. That leaves many young adults without romantic partners. And it turns out that screens make very poor substitutes.There is no delicate way to say this: Screens can deliver orgasms but they are completely unable to provide the other benefits of human contact. People who are not romantically involved or who lack close friends or family are also missing out on the kind of touches that Biden sometimes inappropriately delivered -- back rubs head kisses hand-holding and bear hugs.There is a wealth of psychological literature showing that skin-to-skin contact is critical for the normal mental development of human infants. All but the most fragile preterm babies do better when cuddled in their mothers' arms than in incubators. Studies have shown that babies in Romanian orphanages who were provided with nutrition and clean diapers but were rarely held or spoken to grew into emotionally stunted children.In childhood too physical contact is critical for children's wellbeing. When fathers roughhouse with their young children the kids are better able to regulate their emotions including aggression and are found to be more popular with their peers than children who lack this kind of play.Our need to touch and be touched never subsides. Chronic loneliness has been found to be as harmful to health as smoking. Studies have found that hugs don't just relieve stress and release oxytocin (the bonding hormone); they can also reduce susceptibility to the common cold lower blood pressure and diminish pain. And when humans pet animals both experience physiological benefits. Even just holding hands with a loved one while enduring a painful medical procedure has been found to make the experience more bearable. When close couples hold hands their heart rates and brain waves tend to synchronize.Most of us just aren't designed to live the kind of solitary lives that excessive entanglement with technology is encouraging. We are social and also tactile creatures. Our recent social trend away from marriage and toward silicone companions is the equivalent of taking people away from a roaring fireplace surrounded by loved ones and placing them in solitary steel and glass pods. Let's not lose sight of our affective natures even as we police the excessively handsy amongst us.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

After all these are the politicians who told the American people for the past two years the president colluded with Russia to affect the outcome of the 2016 election -- a lie.Desperate Democrats scrambling to save face are now working overtime launching an additional never-ending investigation into virtually every aspect of the president's life including his vast business empire and shuttered foundation. But that's not all. The House Judiciary Committee issued an unnecessary subpoena to the attorney general this week that demands a full unredacted copy of the special counsel report and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal is demanding the IRS release six years of the president's personal tax returns and those of some of his businesses.This out-of-control fishing expedition on the backs of taxpayers goes well beyond presidential harassment; it's a full-blown Inquisition waged by a hateful cabal of rabid Democrats weaponizing government agencies to target political opponents.""This was not a transparency subpoena. This was a 2020 subpoena"" said House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows in an interview on Fox News' ""America's Newsroom."" ""It's all political theater. It has nothing to do with really getting to the truth.""Of course Trump's enemies in Washington claim they're just fulfilling their congressional oversight duties and seeking ""transparency."" That's quite laughable given these are the same Democrats who aren't the slightest bit interested in oversight or transparency when it comes to their own party's dirty deeds or illicit actions by the deep state agents who spied on the 2016 Trump campaign using deceptive and misleading FISA warrants.Not to mention other pernicious actions to remove a duly elected president.Once such example is Rep. Schiff's attempt to block Congress from accessing the bank records of Fusion GPS to shield Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee which paid millions to the slimy opposition research firm for the infamous ""dirty dossier"" used by the FBI to spur the special counsel investigation. Then there's House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler who during the 1998 Bill Clinton investigation conducted by independent counsel Kenneth Starr was against the public release of details contained in the report. Back then he sought to protect grand jury testimony.All of this illustrates that when it comes to government oversight and ""transparency"" Democrats have a distinct set of rules: One for thee and none for me.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Please Reconsider Mr. President | RealClearPoliticVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In 2017 speaking to a group of leaders from Central America Vice President Mike Pence declared ""To further stem the flow of illegal immigration and illegal drugs into the United States President Trump knows as do all of you that we must confront these problems at their source. We must meet them -- and we must solve them -- in Central and South America."" What Pence said then was correct. What President Donald Trump is doing now -- cutting aid -- needs to be reconsidered.Fifteen years ago Colombia was on the verge of collapse. The nation was overrun with drug traffickers cartels and local gangs. Crime and violence were rampant and people were fleeing the nation. The United States deployed its foreign aid budget and military resources to help the Colombian government stabilize fight its domestic drug war and beat the cartels. The nation went from the brink to being a stable leader in South America and a strategic ally of the United States. In the past decade trade with Colombia has tripled to $14 billion benefiting American businesses.Since 2016 American assistance to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador has declined 20%. Concurrent with that decline in American assistance those countries have seen an increase in domestic crime corruption and flight of refugees headed toward the United States.According to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition ""in neighborhoods where USAID operates in El Salvador and Honduras homicide rates have plummeted by up to 78%."" Likewise ""for every 10 additional murders in Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala 6 additional children sought safety in the United States.""Notably the Trump administration itself claims El Salvador has used our aid to stem the tide of illegal immigrants headed to the border. The Washington Post's Kevin Sieff wrote last week about remarks made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan: ""'What (El Salvador is) doing is working both on the security front and on the economic opportunity front' ... McAleenan speaking last year at the Bipartisan Policy Center described El Salvador as a model: 'We want to achieve those same successes in Honduras and Guatemala as well.'""The last time the United States worked in concert with Central American countries to fund internal projects related to fighting crime corruption and abuse those governments committed 10 times as many resources and with our dollars and direction saw crime and population flight decrease. In 2017 we spent $420 million in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador to help. Those countries combined spent $5.4 billion of their own resources but let the U.S. take the lead in a partnership that benefited us all.As former White House Chief of Staff and Southcom Gen. John Kelly has noted ""If we can improve the conditions the lot in life of Hondurans Guatemalans Central Americans we can do an awful lot to protect the southwest border.""I used to believe we should cut foreign aid from our budget. But I have realized we can spend far less in these countries helping stabilize situations than we could on the border wall a project I support. If we just build a wall we are going to see an increase in violence drug trafficking and nation-state collapse. Those problems will eventually penetrate our border with or without a wall. Right now cutting off funding and having no wall will thoroughly destabilize the situation. On top of that these countries are in many cases desperate. By ignoring them we are seeding the ground for China to lay down roots in the Western Hemisphere as it and Russia have tried to do in places such as Venezuela.We risk undermining our long-term national interests by cutting this foreign aid. We should instead spend it wisely in those countries to ensure stable governments that view us as allies and work with them to root out crime corruption and cartels. The present policy to cut foreign aid cuts off our national nose to spite our face.Erick Erickson is editor of TheResurgent.com.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Private-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in Egypt | RealClearPoliticPrivate-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in EgypPrivate-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in EgypPrivate-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in EgypVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...CAIRO -- You can't find many success stories in America's sour sullen relationship with Egypt over the past decade. Mostly it's been a tale of mutual suspicion thanks to erratic American policy and growing Egyptian political repression.But talking with Amal Enan a 33-year-old Egyptian economist you realize what a healthy relationship could accomplish. She runs the Cairo office of an innovative little-noticed development project that's quietly backed by the two governments known as the Egyptian American Enterprise Fund.This private-equity fund using money appropriated by Congress is helping finance new small and medium-size businesses that are creating jobs and entrepreneurial energy in the sometimes moribund statist Egyptian economy. Starting with $300 million the fund has had a roughly 19% internal rate of return over the past four years Enan says.With President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi visiting Washington later this month it's a good time to think about projects like this that can help the Egyptian people rather than the military and the regime. There's a trust gap with the Egyptian public: America has alienated nearly every segment of the population here since 2011 -- by jettisoning pro-Western President Hosni Mubarak that year then looking the other way during el-Sissi's 2013 coup against Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and then shunning el-Sissi.The Egyptian-American relationship was a jewel of U.S. foreign policy four decades ago with the Camp David peace agreements but those days are long gone. Yet Egypt still matters in the Arab world and a mutual repair process makes sense. The story of the Enterprise Fund illustrates how this reset could begin.Enan met meÂ last Sunday in downtown Cairo at a hotel next to Tahrir Square the epicenter of the Arab Spring rebellion in 2011 that ousted Mubarak empowered Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and then boomeranged with a takeover by the Egyptian military through then-Gen. el-Sissi. The regime now suppresses journalists comedians actors and even this week Egypt's cherished soap operas.Tahrir Square is largely empty these days physically and emotionally. Cairo itself seems a noisy but somewhat joyless city where half-filled tourist boats ply the Nile and Egyptians seem united above all in resenting the United States. There's so little interest in American studies these days at the American University in Cairo that the department has been looking for other missions.Enan is an encouraging counterpoint. A Cairo University graduate who received an MBA from Harvard Business School she demonstrates the intellectual capital that's abundantly available in Egypt despite the autocratic regime. The fund's investments similarly show the business creativity that's bubbling under the lid.The fund's strategy was to jump-start private-equity markets that could finance startups and innovative companies. To assemble and manage its portfolio the fund chose an Egyptian investment firm Lorax Capital Partners. The Egyptian government was wary at first but gradually embraced the project.The fund's portfolio illustrates the opportunities that exist in Egypt and other so-called ""frontier"" markets. The first investment was in a company called Fawry an electronic-payments firm that has 120000 outlets throughout Egypt; its market value has quadrupled since the fund invested in 2015. Next came Sarwa Capital a consumer-finance company that recently went public at three times its early valuation; the fund also backed Orchidia one of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies in Egypt.To incubate growth the fund invested in Algebra Ventures a local venture-capital fund and Flat6Labs which helps local tech entrepreneurs start businesses. Around this U.S.-backed nexus other private-equity firms have begun to invest too.The Egyptian-American fund is the brainchild of James Harmon who ran the Export-Import Bank during the Clinton administration and then founded the Caravel Fund which invests in an emerging and frontier markets. Harmon argues that political reform will be impossible in Egypt without a dynamic economy that can create jobs.Harmon thinks the Trump administration should build on the success of the Enterprise Fund and create similar enterprise funds in other countries that need growth and prosperity. He's right; Congress is already considering such a fund for Jordan.Another obvious candidate for such a venture is Central America which badly needs new local businesses that can hire people -- and keep them from attempting a desperate migration across America's southern border. That strikes me as a no-brainer.American foreign policy often focuses on giving countries political advice -- which in Egypt and many other countries has created a backlash of popular resentment. The Enterprise Fund idea is instead to give them capital to start new businesses. The balance sheet presented by Enan suggests this is one American strategy that actually works.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Congress Is Right to Subpoena the Mueller Report. It Shouldn't Have Had To. | RealClearPoliticCongress Is Right to Subpoena the Mueller Report. It Shouldn't Have Had To.Congress Is Right to Subpoena the Mueller Report. It Shouldn't Have Had To.Congress Is Right to Subpoena the Mueller Report. It Shouldn't Have Had To.Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee should not have had to vote Wednesday to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It should already have been sent to Congress. The fact that the body's Democrats had to take this forcing action underscores why Attorney General William Barr's handling of the document so far is irresponsible -- and yes suspicious.Let's look at the timeline. Mueller submitted his report March 22. Two days later on March 24 Barr issued his four-page letter that included not one complete sentence from the report. Barr quoted the report as saying: ""[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" Note that the quote leaves out the beginning of the original sentence.And note also that Barr's own words said Mueller ""did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia."" The phase ""did not establish"" is not the same as ""did not find"" but we have no way of knowing absent the report itself how significant that difference is. What we do know is that Barr seems to have put the best possible spin for Trump on what Mueller himself wrote.Indeed The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that there is dissatisfaction on the Mueller team with Barr's account.""Some of Robert S. Mueller III's investigators"" the paper reported ""have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated.""Yet another reason why Congress and the public need to see the real thing.And The Washington Post reported that ""some members"" of Mueller's team ""were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared."" Barr needs to release those summaries too and be asked why he didn't make them public in or with his March 24 letter.On obstruction Barr quoted the Mueller document saying that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime it also does not exonerate him."" Then Barr made an astonishing assertion: ""The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime."" Barr who had already criticized what he took to be Mueller's theory on obstruction before he became attorney general went on (surprise surprise) to absolve the president writing ""that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""But wait a minute: Did Mueller's decision not to make a call mean that it was Barr's decision to make? There is nothing that automatically gives Barr that power. Perhaps Mueller intended to leave the decision on obstruction to Congress not to Barr. Maybe Mueller was silent on this issue in his report. Maybe he wasn't. We can't know because we haven't seen the report.And then came a strange letter from Barr on March 29 in which he complained that many were ""mischaracterizing"" his March 24 letter.""My March 24 letter was not and did not purport to be an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel's investigation or report. ... I do not believe it would be in the public's interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.""So a summary was not a summary and his first letter was well incomplete or at least not ""exhaustive"" or ... well what was it? A news release? President Trump certainly had no problem crying from the heavens that Barr's letter was a good-enough summary for him and that it cleared him of everything.Which means that looking at everything Barr is doing with a suspicious eye is at this point the only safe thing to do. Especially when Trump who had previously said he had no problem releasing the report complained on Tuesday that it was a ""disgrace"" that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. was now demanding the very sort of disclosure the president had once endorsed. Trump it would seem was for releasing the full report before he was against it.When the committee voted for the subpoena on Wednesday Nadler said: ""The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct. That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves -- not the attorney general's summary not a substantially redacted synopsis but the full report and the underlying evidence."" In light of everything that has happened since Mueller turned in his report on March 22 how could Congress settle for anything less?(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
Trump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor China | RealClearPoliticTrump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor ChinTrump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor ChinTrump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor ChinVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Did you know that it costs significantly more to mail a package to Boise from Boston than it does from Beijing?According to the U.S. Postal Service itaround $20 to mail a small parcel weighing 4.4 pounds from one U.S. state to another yet mailing the same package from China only costs about $5. Millions of Americans who have purchased consumer goods online from Chinese sellers for a few bucks shipping included have likely noticed this disparity first-hand.This shipping differential is the product of the U.S. government subsidizing Chinese shipments. The governmentUSPS delivers Chinese goods at a 40% to 70% discount losing money on each package it delivers.This unfair dynamic hurts U.S. small businesses whose bottom lines are increasingly reliant on e-commerce because it allows China to dump its often-counterfeit products in the U.S. market at an artificially low cost. And it sticks taxpayers with the tab because they are on the hook for bailing out the government-funded USPS. Yes you read that right. Uncle Sam allows this to happen and is ultimately to blame. With a friend like this who needs enemies?The Universal Postal Union a United Nations agency that sets postal rates among its 192-member countries dictates USPS's artificially low rates. It bizarrelyChina â€“ the worldâ€™s second-largest economy â€“ with developing nations like Gabon andinto its third tier of shipping rates which are just a fraction of what the developed world must pay.Successive U.S. presidents have turned a blind eye to this injustice.Â Until now. The Trump administration has made correcting this shipping status quo a priority. Last month the federal Advisory Committee on International Postal and Delivery Services a unit of the State Departmentto discuss its plan to reform UPU rules to allow the U.S. to self-declare rates for inbound delivery rather than follow UPU diktat. Self-declaration is already standard for larger packages that weigh more than 4.4 pounds.the U.S. would begin to withdraw from the UPU entirely -- a process that takes one year to complete -- while simultaneously seeking to renegotiate UPU terms.retain the U.S. as a member UPU officials are meeting this month to consider the U.S.â€™s proposal.the world's mail goes through the U.S. the UPU would be wise to accept the administrationâ€™s offer. If it refuses to do so Trump shouldn't let bureaucratic inertia at the State Department slow down his order to extricate the U.S. from this bad deal by this October.Consider some examples of how this current shipping dynamic is hurting U.S. small businesses. Jayme a small New Jersey travel mug manufacturer$6.30 to ship a mug domestically. His Chinese counterparts sell knock-offs of his product for $5.69 including free shipping all the way from China. Becca Peter a WashingtonÂ state designer packaging tape manufacturer$3.50 for domestic shipping. Her Chinese competitors charge just $2 for their version of the product shipping included.Bigger businesses and franchises such as the recently bankrupt Radio Shack and Toys R Us are also negatively affected. Arthur Herman a senior fellow at the Hudson Institutehow an electric voltage measurer cost $24.99 at Radio Shack versus $15.82 at Deal Extreme a Chinese e-commerce company. At this price differential many Americans would have purchased at Radio Shack given its reputation and return policy. Yet factor in shipping -- $5.95 at Radio Shack versus free at Deal Extreme â€“ and all of aare being asked to pay twice as much to purchase their product domestically. Herman argues this dynamic helped kill Radio Shack.on Chinese imports -- losing aboutit delivers. Given that China will deliver hundreds of millions ofÂ small packages this year eliminating this postal subsidy would be enough to move USPS from the red into the black when it comes to Chinese imports.Until this happens USPS will be forced to continue raising domestic shipping ratesrecoup losses as it has done in recent years. This means taxpayers and American shippers are effectively subsidizing Chinese merchants.Reforming UPU rules has received broad support from across the political spectrum. It is a non-controversial way to level the playing field to help U.S. small businesses compete fairly against their Chinese competitorsÂ while also improving the trade deficit.Whether UPU terms are reformed to allow the U.S. to self-declare its own rates or whether the U.S. leaves the Swiss-based organization altogether the days of something costing less to mail across the world than across the county line are numbered. Get ready to chalk up another victory for U.S. small businesses and taxpayers under President Trump.Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

Former Attorney General Eric Holder is among the latest high-profile Democrats to call for eliminating the age-old system deeming it a â€œvestige of the pastâ€ù and â€œundemocratic.â€ù Some of the Democrats in the crowded 2020 field ranging from South Bend Ind. Mayor Peter Buttigieg to Sens. Elizabeth and Kirsten Gillibrand had previously sounded the call. Warren has argued for a change in which â€œevery vote matters.â€ùA group of big-state Democratic senators including Gillibrand (New York) Dick Durbin (Illinois) and Dianne Feinstein (California) introduced a constitutional amendment Tuesday that would jettison the Electoral College. The measure is mostly an exercise to spur debate because such amendments require two-thirds majority votes in both the chambers of Congress and GOP Senate leaders would no doubt block it from receiving any floor consideration.Complaints about the Electoral College arose in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote narrowly over George W. Bush but was denied the presidency after a fiercely contested Florida recount put Bush in the White House. The Democratic push this time is more than grousing. Amid the partyâ€™s continued furor over Hillary Clintonâ€™s 2016 loss to Donald Trump even though she won the popular vote it has become a rallying cry.If American history is any guide however both major political parties should be careful what they wish for. Altering the Constitution doesnâ€™t always produce the expected consequences. Republicansâ€™ rage over Franklin Rooseveltâ€™s decision to break precedent and seek a third (and then a fourth) term led directly to the 2Amendment. Passed by Congress in 1947 it was ratified in enough states to take effect in 1951. Its most obvious result was to deny Dwight Eisenhower a chance to run in 1960 a race heâ€™d have been favored to win. Goodbye Camelot.The Republican establishment hasnâ€™t learned that lesson. To them the equation is clear: Defending the traditional system puts the GOP in the best position for President Trump to win a second term. But some Republicans wonder if the conventional wisdom is short-sighted. For starters these contrarians are concerned with how the existing Electoral College dynamic has reduced civic engagement in whole areas of the country from the deeply red South rural Plains and mountain West to the millions of essentially disenfranchised Republicans in Democrat-dominated California. Such places are ignored every four years as the two major parties and their respective presidential tickets spend almost all of their time and treasure in roughly a dozen battleground states.Of more pressing concern these GOP contrarians also point out that the electoral map that currently favors them is not set in stone.In addition Republicans who support shifting to greater reliance on the popular vote argue that in five to 10 years their candidates may find themselves at a disadvantage even under the current system. Thatâ€™s because demographics are changing palpably and Republicans might well lose their ability to win the important swing state of Florida and possibly even the GOP anchor state of Texas.In 2010 according to the U.S. Census Hispanics made up 23 percent of Floridaâ€™s population. Projections put that figure at nearly 26 percent in 2017. Floridaâ€™s Cuban-Americans once reliably Republican are now split with the younger generation increasingly voting Democratic. Following Hurricane Maria Puerto Ricans who trend Democratic have moved to Florida by the tens of thousands.Popular Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis could help blunt Democratic inroads in the near term but keeping the Sunshine State in play might require significant recalibration.Texas is another important consideration. It certainly is solidly red today: The Lone Star State has voted Republican in the last 10 elections. But itâ€™s worth taking a closer look. In six of those elections a Texan named George Bush was on the GOP ballot. And in the previous 20 elections going back to William McKinley the state went for every Democratic presidential nominee except Al Smith in 1928 Richard Nixon in 1972 and both times Adlai Stevenson faced World War II hero Dwight Eisenhower. Otherwise the map was a sea of Democratic blue.The point here is that over time the political leanings of states change sometimes radically. For a while they may swing purple. They may stay that way or they may move to the other camp. Sometimes their reputations lag behind the reality. From the time of the Civil War to the onset of the Great Depression Maine was the great bellwether leading to the mantra taught to schoolchildren across the country: â€œAs Maine goes so goes the nation.â€ù In 1936 however Franklin Roosevelt swept every state in the union except Maine and Vermont leading to a puckish quip from FDR campaign manager James Farley â€œAs Maine goes so goes Vermont.â€ù But the latter state has changed too. Until Patrick Leahy was elected in the 1970s Vermont had never had a Democratic senator. Today itâ€™s so liberal that Leahyâ€™s home-state Senate colleague felt the need to hyphenate the word â€œDemocratâ€ù and attach â€œSocialist.â€ù Republicans need not apply.Could such a metamorphosis take place in Texas? Why not it happened only a generation ago in California. And last year Democrat Beto Oâ€™Rourke came within two percentage points of ousting Sen. Ted Cruz. Was that an anomaly or the first signs of a purple flower blooming? Just a month before the election a Quinnipiac survey found Oâ€™Rourke leading among voters under the age of 50 with the support of 66 percent of likely voters between the ages of 18 and 34 while Cruz held a significant lead among older voters.A March 1 Quinnipiac poll of possible 2020 matchups has Trump essentially tied in the state with Joe Biden Bernie Sanders and Oâ€™Rourke.â€œIf Florida and Texas shift to the Democrats you look at that blue wall and thereâ€™s zero path to victory for Republicans using the current winner-take-allâ€ù Electoral College system Saul Anuzis the former Republican Party chairman in Michigan told RealClearPolitics.History suggests that this warning is exaggerated. For one thing historically Democratic bastions such as Michigan Wisconsin Minnesota and Pennsylvania could very well move in the other direction.Moreover Anuzis is not pessimistic. He and others are suggesting that if Republicans are forced to compete for the popular vote it could ultimately strengthen the GOP by making it less of a regional party and leaving it less reliant on an aging demographical cohort: namely white voters.These would-be reformers have aligned themselves with a movement called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (Anuzis is a senior consultant). It would go into effect when enacted by states collectively possessing a majority of the electoral votes necessary to elect a president: 270 out of 538. Instead of each state designating all of its electoral votes to the winner of that stateâ€™s popular vote those states in the compact would agree to hand over their electors to the candidate who receives the most votes across the nation.Unlike the Democratic Party push to abolish the Electoral College which would take a constitutional amendment thecompact preserves it but lessens its power. While national political figures clash over the Electoral College a growing number of states have already quietly moved to largely bypass it by approving the compact. Last week Delawareâ€™s governor signed the compact into law just weeks after Colorado did the same. On Wednesday New Mexico followed suit.Eleven other states and the District of Columbia have likewise done so with the initiative nearing the 200 mark for combined electoral votes but still significantly shy of the 270 needed to switch the system. Â Thatâ€™s one more reason advocates say Trump supporters shouldnâ€™t fear the popular vote compact â€“ it has no real chance of becoming law in enough states to replace the Electoral College by 2020.Itâ€™s also based on federalism and respect for state rights Anuzis explained and if itâ€™s not working the way states planned state legislatures can change it. Under the compact instead of presidential candidates focusing all their time and money on a small number of battleground states every four years and showering those states with pet projects and federal spending to help woo voters there candidates would be forced to spend time campaigning across the country.â€œIf you look at little bit beyond Trump and look at the hard math and shifting demographics going to a system that encourages everyone to vote and candidates to talk to as many people as possible Republicans have a chance of winning in a very fair fightâ€ù said Anthony Delcollo a Republican member of the Delaware Senate who co-sponsored the compact bill.Before winning the Electoral College Trump expressed distrust of the system frequently referring to it as â€œrigged.â€ù He was onto something Delcollo argued because the system is rigged against Republicans with an estimated 240 electors coming from traditionally blue states and only 115 from traditionally red ones.â€œIf Texas does become a swing state in the future then that number drops to roughly 70â€ù Delcollo said. â€œIf Texas becomes purple it becomes very very hard to win in the Electoral College and if Florida becomes blue that means a Democrat would win every single timeâ€ù â€“ assuming of course that other states donâ€™t shift in the opposite direction.Before his 2016 victory upended conventional wisdom in 2012 Trump used similar language to decry the Electoral College calling it a â€œdisaster for democracy â€_ a total sham and a travesty.â€ùEven a month after his win Trump was still naturally inclined to favor a popular vote system telling CBSâ€™ â€œ60 Minutesâ€ù that he would rather have a process that depends on â€œsimple votesâ€ù as he phrased it.â€œYou know you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million and you winâ€ù Trump said. â€œThereâ€™s a reason for doing this. Because it brings all the states into play.â€ùAfter Democrats started gunning for the Electoral College Trump changed his mind recently arguing on Twitter that â€œwith the popular vote you go to just the large states â€“ the cities would end up running the country. Smaller states and the entire Midwest would up losing all power &amp; we canâ€™t let that happen.â€ùThe president seemed to echo sentiments from some of his most ardent supporters on the right who want to preserve the system that handed him his surprise victory. But Democrats are working overtime to prevent a repeat performance strategically holding their national convention in Milwaukee Wis. as a show of force in a state Clinton neglected -- and failed to win.Victor Davis Hanson became the latest conservative to push back against progressive Democratsâ€™ calls to scrap the two-century-old tradition of granting electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote within each state.The Electoral College was designed in part to ensure that candidates â€œat least visited the small and rural states of Americaâ€ù Hanson wrote in. â€œThe â€_ Founding Fathers did not want elections to rest solely with larger urban populations. The Electoral College balances out the popular vote.â€ùHanson characterized the attacks on the system as an unprincipled power grab aimed at preventing another Trump win which could again happen without carrying the popular vote.Supporters of the popular vote countered by stressing that the nationâ€™s five biggest cities â€“ New York Los Angeles Chicago Houston and Philadelphia â€“ represent just 6 percent of the countryâ€™s population. Moreover the population of the 50 biggest cities represents only 15 percent of the population.Besides they say itâ€™s a myth that the Founders established the Electoral College to prevent elections from becoming contests where presidential candidates would simply campaign in big cities because in the late 1700s 95 percent of the population lived in places with fewer than 2500 people.â€œItâ€™s basically a travesty that a small selection of swing states decide our president and they get more funding per capita and they wash out the voice of all the statesâ€ù Delcollo said. â€œThereâ€™s nothing small-government or conservative about that.â€ùSusan Crabtree is a veteran Washington reporter who has spent two decades covering the White House and Congress.National Popular Vote Interstate CompacLog In with your RCMG Accoun,0
We Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start Agreeing | RealClearPoliticWe Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start AgreeinWe Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start AgreeinWe Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start AgreeinVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...over Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerbergâ€™sfor â€œnew rulesâ€ù to regulate internet companies like his â€” and that should worry every freedom-loving American.Donâ€™t be fooled. This is not some humbled executive begrudgingly accepting that his industry needs regulation. This is one of the richest men on earth inviting the American government to help him do what he already wants to do anyway.Letâ€™s be perfectly clear: Every single regulatory measure Zuckerberg is calling for would benefit his company his political and himself personally. At best regulation would just deflect from the unsavory practices of Facebook and its competitors; at worst it would enlist government sponsorship for those practices.Democratic Sen. Mark Warner greeted Zuckerbergâ€™s announcement byhe was â€œglad to seeâ€ù that â€œthe era of the social media Wild West is over.â€ùOf course when Warner refers to the â€œsocial media Wild Westâ€ù heâ€™s not talking about tech giants routinelymemes that lampoon their journalist friends andRepublican candidates during election campaigns.No Warner means the Wild West of relatively unbridled free speech that allowed millions of Americans to crack the consensus forged by the political establishment of both parties in 2016.When he says â€œthe Wild West is overâ€ù Warner means just what Googleâ€™s CFOwhen he promised to â€œuse the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important valuesâ€ù just days after President Trumpâ€™s victory over Hillary Clinton.Those on the left are determined to prevent a repeat of the 2016 presidential election which is why they are so adamantly pushing for more censorship online. Itâ€™s just their luck that they have a potential ally in Zuckerberg a man who would love to throw this hands up and say â€œHey the government handles that.â€ùIn his Washington Post op-ed Zuckerberg calls for an â€œindependent bodyâ€ù to do his censorship for him and decide what â€œcounts as terrorist propaganda hate speech and more.â€ùZuckerberg actually has the gall to write â€œLawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech and frankly I agreeâ€ù asserting that while internet companies should be â€œaccountable for enforcing standards on harmful contentâ€ù those standards should be dictated by government officials.To be sure outspoken conservatives such as Sens.have demanded answers from Big Tech regarding its ever-tightening campaign of censorship against the political right and Silicon Valleyâ€™s exploitation of its power over the main forums of modern public discourse to potentially swing elections â€” but their point has been that censorship of any kind is an affront to the American people. Zuckerbergâ€™s response however is to propose more censorship not less.Itâ€™s all ridiculous. We donâ€™t need leftist bureaucrats to tell us what we can say on the internet any more than we need leftist tech executives to police our speech. We donâ€™t need an â€œindependent bodyâ€ù to protect us from â€œharmful contentâ€ù â€” we already have the Supreme Court the First Amendment and 100 years of precedent to guide our governance of public forums.These are plenty sufficient to prohibit viewpoint-based discrimination while banning illegal acts such as calls to violence and allowing private platforms like Facebook to enact reasonable time place and manner restrictions according to their taste.Sen. Hawley for instance hasthat the special privileges Facebook enjoys under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act be conditioned on it serving as a viewpoint-neutral public forum. For some reason though thatâ€™s not the kind of regulation Zuckerberg is interested in.Zuckerbergâ€™s other â€œconcessionsâ€ù are no less self-serving. His call for greater transparency in political advertising for instance is laughable. Zuckerberg argues that we already have sufficient regulation of ads run by candidates and parties despite the fact that Facebook infamouslyin 2018 but he asserts that we need stronger rules governing ads about â€œdivisive political issues where weâ€™ve seen more attempted interferenceâ€ù feeding into the Democratsâ€™ absurd narrative that a few Russian Facebook ads explain Hillary Clintonâ€™s defeat.In a perfect illustration of the globalist corporate mindset Zuckerberg also calls for importing privacy laws from the European Union where people are routinelyin jail for social media arguing that â€œeffective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework.â€ùLuckily the regulators President Trump has put in place are wise to Zuckerbergâ€™s game. As FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr â€œWhen large corporations call for greater government control it's not usually an act of charity.â€ùThatâ€™s exactly the sort of hard-headed realism we need to protect our fundamental rights as Facebook and other Big Tech companies ramp up their campaign of anti-conservative censorship especially now that Zuckerberg is trying to enlist liberal politicians with tremendous power as allies in that effort.Brad Parscale is the campaign manager for Donald J.

As NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed Bonds | RealClearPoliticAs NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed BondAs NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed BondAs NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed BondVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...April 4 is the 7anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which began with the signing of the so-called Washington Treaty by 12 founding nation-states mostly Western European nations along with the United States.Â  The pact was an expansion of the Brussels Treaty that preceded it drawing the U.S. into the alliance as a necessary guarantor of security for Western Europe. The mission was to form a stronger coalition to prevent a repeat of the circumstances that led predominantly in Germany to the two world wars and also deter the expansionist aspirations of the newly formed communist Soviet Union.Seven decades on NATO has grown to include 29 nations. But its strength and the commitment of its members to mutual security is very much in question as acommissioned by CKI and RealClearPolitics to mark the anniversary makes evident.To be fair the United Statesâ€™ own entry into the alliance was not without reservation a reluctance with deep historical roots.Â  (In his farewell address George Washington spoke of his concerns about alliances dragging nations into someone elseâ€™s wars.) Secretary of State George Marshall had expressed concerns to British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin: â€œShow what youâ€™re prepared to do for yourselves and each other and then weâ€™ll think about what we might do.â€ùHowever after deliberations and careful wording of the treaty wariness about Soviet militarization and expansion compelled the U.S. to join NATO in what would become the Cold War strategy of containment.In response the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact â€“ formally known as the Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Mutual Assistance -- comprised of Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe. Decades later some experts in the field of international relations see modern parallels between Western nationsâ€™ security expansion and a Russian response. University of Chicago Professor John J. Mearsheimer commenting in 2014 on Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukrainethat â€œthe United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis. The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of Russiaâ€™s orbit and integrate it into the West.â€ùThough this sentiment was not widely held both President Obama and now President Trump voiced concern over the transatlantic alliance â€“ primarily in ways that echoedÂ  Marshallâ€™s.Obamaâ€™s relationship with NATO declined as his frustrations grew over European alliesâ€™ lack of response to the turmoil in Libya prompting him to refer to them as â€œ.â€ù Although the 2 percent of GDP spending for NATO is only a guideline not a requirement for member states Europeâ€™s contribution has fallen. Obama's critique of Europe's response to the Libya situation exposed a perhaps more significant shortcoming among NATO nations than just spending: a lack of resolve.Trumpâ€™s harsh rhetoric has taken the NATO debate to an entirely new level. Throughout much of 2018 he went so far as to threatenthe U.S. from the alliance.The recent CKI/RCP poll conducted by YouGov provides insights into why both Obama and Trump have called the European commitment â€“ especially that of Germans surveyed -- to the NATO alliance into question.The poll found that a majority of Germans are indifferent to the security provided by the organization. Most striking is that 48 percent of German respondents think they should not provide military support to a NATO member state if Russia attacks it with an additional 28 percent saying that they don't know if support would be warranted. (Curiously most Germans also think that their own nation falls short of providing their security.) A majority are also against providing military support to the United States if it were attacked a stark contrast to French and British respondents among whom only about a third are opposed.The reason for Germansâ€™ indifference may be reflected by another finding: Germany no longer perceives Russia to be the great threat it once was (to a lesser extent neither does the rest of Western Europe).A majority of Germans even go so far as to say they perceive the U.S. to be athreat to their security than Russia. Though many attribute this to Trumpâ€™s threats toof NATO the CKI/RCP polling suggests that more is involved. When asked if Russia were to invade any NATO country only a quarter (in Germany and France) to a third (in the U.S. and U.K.) think their countries should provide a military response to defend that country.Â  On the flip side about a third (in the U.S. U.K. and France) and nearly half (as already cited 48 percent) of Germans think their country should not respond.Â  Though not a majority these numbers represent a significant rebuke of the NATO charterâ€™s Article V which stipulates mutual defense on both sides of the Atlantic.Obamaâ€™s frustration and now Trumpâ€™s openly critical brand of diplomacy highlight what is perhaps a consequence of the Cold War peace dividend -- the Western military rollback resulting from the reduced threat after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.Â  Further stressed by the global financial crisis of 2008 the European NATO states have become introspective focused most on internal security and cautious in their spending.Â  Notwithstanding Russiaâ€™s intensive cyber and information operations Europeans largely no longer perceive it to be the great threat of generations past.History shows that they do so at their peril. With the 7anniversary of NATO at hand the disinterest in honoring the organizationâ€™s guiding principle of mutual cooperation and security should be seen as a clarion call to revisit the alliance -- before the next crisis occurs.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
"Is Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden? | RealClearPoliticIs Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden?Is Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden?Is Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden?Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...There was always something fishy about the #MeToo complaint against Joe Biden. Putting hands on Lucy Flores' shoulders and smooching the back of her head is in no way sexual. Even Flores admitted that.Nonetheless Flores gave a dramatic rendition of the distress it caused her. ""I just froze"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do. Because again the only thing that you're processing is that there is a very powerful man standing next to you ... and you just don't know how to respond.""What doesn't add up? Everything.Flores was not a preadolescent nymph but rather the 2014 Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor. If a kiss on the back of her head made her freeze how would she have responded to a genuine crisis say a terrorist attack? She was about to go on stage so you'd think she had other things on her mind. Then-Vice President Biden was doing her an enormous favor bestowing his prestige on her candidacy. And if this bothered her so much why did she wait five years to ""come forward""?The most plausible answer is that this stunt isn't about Biden but about helping Bernie Sanders. Lo and behold polls show Biden leading Sanders among Democratic voters -- as Sanders faces his own accusations of disrespecting women.Some backstory: When Flores lost the 2014 election by a landslide establishment Democrats stopped promoting her. (Two years later she lost a primary run for Congress.)In 2016 she joined the Sanders campaign becoming a surrogate. She also joined the board of Our Revolution an advocacy group backing Sanders.Biden advisers share the hunch that the Sanders campaign is behind her charges according to Mike Allen of Axios. And a former Sanders staffer Tezlyn Figaro just called Flores a ""fraud"" on Fox News.We expect that in the future Biden will desist from getting so affectionate with women and will lose the grandfatherly touch. A politician should not do unto women that which he would not do unto men.But let's look at Sanders' lamentable record on women. Women who worked on the 2016 campaign complain that they were made subservient to the boy geniuses. And there was that unforgettable moment when the Bernie bros hurled the C-word at Democratic women running the Nevada State Democratic Convention. Sanders responded to the use of that vilest of words against women with the mildest of hand slaps. Then he blamed both sides. (The official statement has been removed from his website.)Because everyone is delving into Biden's beliefs of decades ago consider Bernie's. In 1969 he opined that sexual maladjustment was linked to breast cancer. ""You might very well be the cause of cancer"" he wrote with his trademark air of authority. Even back then mainstream science rejected theories that psychological factors caused cancer.Sanders also found fault with mothers unhappy that their 16-year-old daughters spent a night out with their boyfriends. ""Are you concerned about HER happiness"" he wrote ""or about your 'reputation' in the community?"" In this worldview not putting out is an emblem of female repression.Zoom to 2019. Sanders says he believes Lucy Flores as do a number of other opportunistic Democrats. Thing is we all believe Flores' account of what Biden did. Videos show Biden hugging kissing and rubbing shoulders of numerous women over the years.What we can't believe is Flores' claim that she is bringing this up now to fix a grievous wrong done her -- rather than an innocent gesture by a national politician who went out of his way to help her campaign. That Sanders and his people are fueling these petty attacks is something we can believe.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Building a Healthy Political System | RealClearPoliticBuilding a Healthy Political SysteBuilding a Healthy Political SysteBuilding a Healthy Political SysteVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...It's no secret that America's political system is badly broken so ScottRasmussen.com decided to find out what voters think is wrong.We began by exploring what voters think is needed to create and maintain a healthy political system. Four items were deemed ""Very Important"" by at least 7 out of every 10 voters: freedom of speech (77%) having political leaders who respect voters (76%) checks and balances between branches of government (73%) and freedom of religion (71%).Five other items were considered Very Important by a majority of voters: freedom of the press (63%) clear limits on what the government can do (62%) political leaders who are willing to compromise (61%) respect for people with fundamentally different views (61%) and limits on taxation (54%).Next we asked whether each of those items is present in America today. We found that most voters believe three of those nine Very Important attributes are missing in America today.-- By a 25% margin (59% to 34%) voters do not believe our political leaders respect American voters.-- By a 29% margin (61% to 32%) voters do not believe we have political leaders who are willing to compromise.-- By a 9% margin (51% to 42%) voters do not think most Americans have respect for people with fundamentally different views.It's interesting to note that all three have to do with attitudes guiding the political process. It's not about the mechanisms of government or violation of rights; it's about the people engaged in the process of governing.That same frustration is evident in other data showing just 27% believe the federal government primarily serves the interest of the American people. More than twice as many -- 60% -- believe it primarily looks out for its own interests. In other words a solid majority of voters see the federal government as a very powerful special-interest group.The perceived self-interest of those in the political game is found repeatedly in our survey work.-- Eighty-two percent of voters believe the top leaders of federal regulatory agencies often use their position to pursue their own personal agenda. Voters believe that rather than serving the public interest these officials are intent on imposing their standards on the rest of the nation.-- Fifty-three percent of voters think it is somewhat likely that their own representative in Congress trades votes for cash. Only 23% are confident that their representative isn't cashing in like that.Add it all up and it's easy to see why just 18% of voters trust the federal government to do the right thing most of the time. This is not something new. It's been 47 years since a majority of voters trusted the federal government.Not coincidentally that ongoing distrust coincides with the explosive growth of the regulatory state that began in the 1970s. A key objective of the regulatory state was to free government officials from accountability to voters. The unsurprising result has been a broken political system in which political leaders do not need to respect the voters.Making the regulatory state more accountable is essential to creating a healthier political system. But we don't need a new set of rules. We need something even more difficult to obtain something we haven't seen among the political elites for a very long time -- respect for the American people.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"A Time for Constitutional Boldness | RealClearPoliticA Time for Constitutional BoldnesA Time for Constitutional BoldnesA Time for Constitutional BoldnesVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- As a country we have become Constitutionally lazy. And timid.Note the capitalization of ""Constitutionally.""At various points in our history we have been willing to reexamine flawed or out of date provisions in our founding document. Six constitutional amendments -- guaranteeing the right to vote for African Americans having voters rather than state legislatures elect our senators abolishing the poll tax giving the District of Columbia a say in the Electoral College and extending the right to vote to women and younger Americans -- made our republic more democratic.The 26th Amendment approved in 1971 to let 18-year-olds vote was the last to get through in a conventional way. The fluky 27th Amendment ratified in 1992 had been sent to the states in 1789. It bars a sitting Congress from raising its own pay and was only approved after Gregory Watson a sophomore at the University of Texas discovered in the 1980s that it was still out there.That our last amendment was something close to an accident underscores how unwilling we are to confront the need for systematic change. That's why I cheered this week when Sen. Brian Schatz D-Hawaii joined a group of colleagues to propose an amendment providing for the election of our president by popular vote not the Electoral College. Sen. Jeff Merkley D-Ore. offered a comparable proposal last month. So far at least seven Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed the idea.Schatz is under no illusions that his proposed amendment will even get out of Congress anytime soon. But ""the basic principle that the person who gets the most votes should be president of the United States"" is worth fighting for he said in an interview. There's value in staking out ""clear principled and popular positions"" and pursuing them with ""persistence and patience.""The view that the Electoral College is outdated and a time bomb for our democracy was once widely held across party lines. As Geoffrey Skelley noted in FiveThirtyEight a May 1968 Gallup poll found that 66 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of Democrats approved of switching to the popular vote. Now the Electoral College offers Republicans a built-in advantage giving the issue a partisan edge. That's unfortunate because faith in the fairness and representativeness of our system will continue to erode if we make it a habit of allowing popular-vote losers to ascend to the Oval Office.Another sign that structural change is back on the public agenda: There are a variety of proposals to change the way Supreme Court justices are selected. This is a response to how partisan both the confirmation process and the court itself have become.Pete Buttigieg the South Bend Indiana mayor and presidential hopeful has floated an intriguing way to push back against politicized jurisprudence. Membership on the court would be increased from nine to 15 members. Republican and Democratic presidents would name five each. Those ten would in turn select the remaining members from the appellate bench by unanimous vote.At the least his far-reaching restructuring might encourage openness to more modest reforms such as 18-year term limits on justices. When the Constitution was adopted life expectancy stood at around 35. Now it's 79. Lifetime appointment means something very different today than it did in 1787.Garrett Epps a law professor at the University of Baltimore noted in an email that constitutional amendments usually ""come in clusters and they tend to come at moments of national optimism and feeling of confidence."" (Too bad for us right now.) The three Civil War amendments -- abolishing slavery guaranteeing equal protection and the right to vote -- are good examples as are the Progressive Era amendments on women's suffrage allowing an income tax and directly electing senators.Epps argues that Electoral College reform is what's most urgently needed.

Palin responded ""They're our next-door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska from an island in Alaska.""In a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit comic Tiny Fey mocked Palin in this exchange with comic Amy Poehler who portrayed Hillary Clinton.Fey as Palin: ""You know Hillary and I don't agree on everything ...""Poehler as Clinton: ""Anything. I believe that diplomacy should be the cornerstone of any foreign policy.""Fey as Palin: ""And I can see Russia from my house.""Two things: First there are places in Alaska where one can in fact see Russia. A Conde Nast travel website put it this way: ""You could argue that this bit of cartographic trivia didn't make Palin an authority on geopolitics but it's factually correct: Russia and Alaska are close enough to make eye contact. On a clear day you could climb a hill on Cape Prince of Wales and maybe make out mainland Siberia just fifty miles away."" Not close enough? Alaska's Little Diomede Island in the Bering Sea lies within easy eyeshot of Big Diomede Island part of Siberia and the easternmost point of Russia. The two islands are separated by the international date line and a mere 2 miles of ocean.Second Palin never said ""I can see Russia from my house."" University of Georgia's Michael Cacciatore co-authored a research paper called ""Misperceptions in Polarized Politics: The Role of Knowledge Religiosity and Media."" About Palin's Russia comment Cacciatore writes:""Almost three-quarters of the American population falsely attributed the statement to Palin. And much of the blame it appears goes to late-night political comedies such as 'The Colbert Report' and 'The Daily Show.' After controlling for other factors including demographics and media use heavy viewers of late-night TV comedy had a (higher) probability of believing that Palin was the first to say 'I can see Russia from my house.' ... Perhaps more alarming neither knowledge nor traditional news media use helped correct this misperception related to Palin. In fact heavy traditional news media users were nearly 14 percentage points more likely than light users to think Palin was responsible for the quote.""This brings us to President Donald Trump a current victim of the Palin Effect. Trump stands accused of an allegedly ""racist"" reaction to the 2017 tragedy in Charlottesville Virginia where a white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd killing one and injuring several others. Many insist Trump downplayed the horror of the Charlottesville tragedy by supposedly stating there were ""good white nationalists and bad white nationalists"" or ""good neo-Nazis and bad neo-Nazis"" at the rally.CNN's Don Lemon while covering a story on the recent mass shootings in New Zealand said ""Nobody has forgotten -- nobody has forgotten -- what he [Trump] said after that deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville."" Lemon played an edited clip of Trump saying: ""You also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did."" Similarly Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel referred to Trump's Charlottesville response to blame him for the Jussie Smollett hoax. Emanuel said: ""The only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could take advantage of a hoax about a hate crime is for the environment -- the toxic environment -- that Donald Trump created. This is a president who drew a moral equivalency between people who are trying to perpetuate bigotry and those who are trying to fight bigotry. ... When you go back to Virginia this is a person who said and I quote 'There are good people on both sides.'""The problem is that TrumpIn his widely misquoted press conference three days after Charlottesville Trump said there were ""very fine people"" on ""both sides"" of the issue of whether it is appropriate to display Confederate monuments in pubic locations. Here is what Trump said: ""Excuse me they didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name."" In case there was any doubt Trump in response to another question said ""I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists becausethey should be condemned totallThe question becomes Why are so many Democrats and members of the media seemingly unaware of what Trump really said? Many know exactly what Trump said and what he meant. But the lie serves a purpose. It advances the Trump-is-racist narrative.COPYRIGHT 2019 LAURENCE A. ELDELog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"The Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like Brexit | RealClearPoliticThe Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like BrexiThe Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like BrexiThe Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like BrexiVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...DUBLIN -- Last week I drove across the Republic of Ireland in under 15 minutes.Okay I cheated a little. Starting in Belleek at the far western tip of Northern Ireland I made for the Fairy Bridges of Bundoran located on the Atlantic Ocean only 8.5 miles away. I was exploiting a quirk in the border a narrow strip of land along the west coast that keeps the majority-Catholic county of Donegal connected to the rest of the republic. So it wasn't much of a feat ... but it does make for a good story.This trip was possible only because the Irish border is so illogical. That illogicality in turn makes its centrality to the Brexit debate perfectly sensible -- and makes for a good story.The boundary is the legacy of England's brutal 17th-century colonization of Ireland's Ulster region which left Catholics and Protestants too intermingled to be separated by any clean political boundary and too mutually antagonistic to comfortably share the Home Rule. The solution -- carve out the six majority protestant counties from the rest of Ireland -- didn't really solve the problem.Nonetheless Northern Irish Catholics and Protestants currently enjoy an uneasy truce a process the European Union assisted by blurring the border to invisibility. I discovered just how invisible when I prepared to commemorate my passage into the republic -- and realized I was already there. The only visible transition had been a slight difference in road signage.But Brexit looms and behind it the specter of a harder more visible border. And so British Prime Minister Theresa May has desperately tried to find some compromise among at least five parties each of whom can't or won't give up the one thing some other party must have.Catholic nationalists in Northern Ireland understandably resent living on their ancestral lands as an ethno-religious minority. They're opposed to border checkpoints even a friendlier version run by the Irish government.I found out just how intense the opposition is about five minutes after pulling into Keady. A pugnacious older gent told me he'd removed the last checkpoints on the Armagh border after Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement in 1998 -- and didn't doubt that the younger lads would tackle the next ones. A January car bombing in Derry indicates that some nationalists may already be getting a jump-start on the Troubles 2.0.But if Brexit happens the E.U. won't consent to a gaping hole in its borders. Unless Britain hews to E.U. rules Ireland which will remain in the E.U. must have something like a border somewhere -- either with the United Kingdom or with the E.U. Which leaves the Irish government with a conundrum. Ireland walling itself off from the E.U. to maintain a connection with Northern Ireland would defeat the purpose of E.U. membership. But it's neither practical nor politically acceptable for the Irish government to actively reharden the border with Northern Ireland.May could of course break the Brexit stalemate either by ceding the E.U. the control it wants or carving Northern Ireland off into its own regulatory zone. But Protestant Unionists are adamant that there can be no separate regime for Northern Ireland because damn it they're British. The 10 Democratic Unionist Party members of Parliament are also the linchpin of May's parliamentary majority.Unfortunately that majority also depends on pro-leave members who insist that U.K. voters voted ""Leave"" not ""Downgrade to nonvoting membership in the E.U."" Pursuing Brexit in name only risks both the May government's democratic legitimacy and an irreparable split in her party.No compromise can possibly satisfy all these reasonable intransigent demands. And so on Wednesday the prime minister crossed a hard border of her own: She sat down with Jeremy Corbyn the leader of the Labour Party to explore a cross-party compromise. With enough Labour votes May could bypass the DUP and the Brexiteers and make enough concessions to Europe to keep the Irish border open.It's hard to overstate how amazing the May-Corbyn meeting was the political equivalent of peace talks between cat and mouse. Corbyn isn't just the opposition leader; he's a socialist radical. Cooperating with him would split May's party down the middle -- and thereby possibly hand him the keys to her office.Taking this step illustrates just how impossible it was to secure compromise within her own majority. And that's the Irish border in a nutshell making humdrum things such as ""compromises"" considerably more difficult -- and less likely -- than startling impossibilities such as driving across a nation in 15 minutes.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"With Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive Unity | RealClearPoliticWith Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive UnitWith Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive UnitWith Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive UnitVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...The Democratic Party has lots of radical new ideas and lots of radical presidential candidates and politicos.But the common hatred of President Donald Trump has united otherwise quite disparate Democratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.); former Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif) Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).These diverse progressive politicians all shared faith in special counsel Robert Mueller and his ""dream team."" They believed over the last two years that the Mueller investigation was slowly grinding down Trump. T-shirts were sold with the slogan ""God Protect Robert Mueller.""The unifying progressive creed assumed that the Mueller's team would eventually find Trump unequivocally guilty of ""collusion"" with Russia. That buzzword was the non-criminal euphemism for felonious conspiracy to rig an election.The hunt for collusion would end with the holy grail of Trump's impeachment and removal from office. In 2020 there would be an almost automatic progressive takeover of government.Periodic leaks from Mueller's team during the investigation's 22 months prompted giddy media anticipation that ""the walls were closing in on"" Trump. It always seemed that the ""noose was tightening"" around him and that yet another ""bombshell"" was about to go off.This anti-Trump echo chamber lessened the need for progressives to offer a comprehensive coherent and winning alternate agenda. Damning the sure-to-be-impeached Trump was unity enough. All progressives at least agreed on that.But as Mueller was supposedly about to indict Trump a divisive hard-left agenda was almost imperceptibly floated to the public: the Green New Deal reparations for slavery abortion redefined as permissible infanticide open borders packing the Supreme Court with liberal justices the abolition of the Electoral College and ICE free college tuition the elimination of student debt Medicare for all a wealth tax a 70 percent top marginal income tax rate a 16-year-old voting age voting rights for ex-felons and on and on.It seemed as if today's radical proposal would become yesterday's sellout within 24 hours as progressives awaited tomorrow's even more revolutionary idea.While progressives were celebrating the seemingly inevitable Mueller indictment of Trump they were also increasingly at odds over many of these divisive and mostly unpopular new issues and over the self-created paradoxes of identity politics.When he was not declaring Trump guilty of treason Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke a lifelong beneficiary of wealth and influence did his best to blast his own past white privilege.Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders when he was not predicating Trump's impeachment talked in the abstract as if an old white guy like himself in the concrete had no business running for president.Current front-runner Joe Biden when he was not gloating over Trump's supposed guilt tried hard to trash his own white male culture as the root of many of America's problems.How odd that three of the anti-white-male party's leading presidential contenders were none other than the white male trio of Biden Bernie and Beto.Now Mueller has gone his report having found no evidence of an election conspiracy. There is no longer a rallying cry of Trump-Russia collusion.In other words an investigation that for two years had reconciled the irreconcilable serves no longer as a source of Democratic unity.We are going to see hard-left Democrats and socialists force their mostly unpopular agenda on politicians and candidates from their own party. And they are now putting their identity-politics money where their mouth is by openly discouraging candidates on the basis of their race and gender.With the end of the Mueller investigation thousands of government documents mostly unredacted will be released. The result may be that the hunters of Trump soon become hunted by federal prosecutors. Sworn statements of Obama administration officials in the Justice Department CIA FBI and other bureaucracies will contradict newly released documents.To escape punishment all of these players in the Russian collusion delusion may now begin to turn on one another after being so united in going after Donald Trump.The media sensationalism and optics will play out in reverse as the ""noose tightens"" and ""the walls close in"" on people such as former CIA Director John Brennan former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.There will also be more infighting over the collective embarrassment of the Russian collusion hoax.A few shamed progressive politicians and reporters will grow quiet and acknowledge their overreach. But many will double down and weirdly insist that there really was Russian collusion and that the Steele dossier was true. Most will remain unashamed and simply move on to the next supposed Trump scandal.Progressives in unison boarded the Mueller express to nowhere. As they now jump off the train wreck the fighting won't be pretty.(C) 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY LLC.Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution Stanford University.

Why This Israeli Election Is Different | RealClearWorlWhy This Israeli Election Is DifferenWhy This Israeli Election Is DifferenWhy This Israeli Election Is DifferenVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Tomorrow Israelis will elect the 2Knesset or parliament in Israelâ€™s 70-year history. Politics are always tricky and more so now. Whatâ€™s real and whatâ€™s fake news? What does each candidate say and what do they actually intend to do?In Israelâ€™s representative parliamentary system things can be even harder to understand. There are manyÂ parties. They rise and fall each year alongside the legacy parties and there is a 3.25 percent threshold for admittance to the Knesset. The left-right paradigm breaks down differently in Israel than it does in the United States or Europe and within the Israeli context that paradigm is undergoing a fundamental realignment.This yearâ€™s elections are vitally important. The outcome could have a major impact on Israelâ€™s future its role in the region and its relationship with the United States and American Jews.Israelâ€™s Knesset consists of 120 seats. Votes are for a pre-determined party list meaning Israelis vote for a party and its candidate for prime minister with the same ballot. Two main parties are battling for the premiership and the right to form the governing coalition. The first is the ruling Likud party headed by Benjamin â€œBibiâ€ù Netanyahu who seeks his fourth term as prime minister. Former Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff and political rookie Benny Gantz is Netanyahuâ€™s main competitor. Gantz leads the Blue and White Party alongside former Finance Minister Yair Lapid and another pair of former IDF chiefs Moshe Yaâ€™alon and Gabi Ashkenazi. Netanyahu stands to the right of center while Gantz and Lapid bill themselves as the new â€œcenterâ€ù a term that changes meaning from election to election. Each side expects to win some 30 seats.To the left we have the heir to Israelâ€™s founding party the left-of-center Avodah or Labor. Further left sits Israelâ€™s progressive party Meretz. Together they are expected to land around 15 seats. Israelâ€™s Arab minority (20 percent of the country) is represented in the main by two parties: Hadash/Taâ€™al is more moderate and seeks to integrate into Israeli society and Raâ€™am/ Balad is the more Palestinian-nationalist and Islamist party. This latter might not pass the 3.25 percent entry threshold a ratio that translates to 4 seats out of 120.Floating alongside the Likud in the right-of-center space are two small parties: Kulanu headed by current Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Gesher headed by Orli Levi-Abekasis. Both lean right on security matters but have preferred to focus on economic and social matters. Both teeter on the verge of the electoral threshold.To Likudâ€™s right are a handful of small parties some new and some more familiar. Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked broke away from the religious-Zionist Jewish Home party a few months back in order to form New Right an alternative party that is younger further to the right and not beholden to religious interests. They are expected to barely pass the electoral threshold. What remained of Jewish Home merged with two religious-Zionist parties each more right-wing on security and religious matters to ensure they all pass the electoral threshold. This is called the Union of the Right Wing Parties and includes the Jewish Power party whose head was banned from office by the election committee for blatant racism. Together they are expected to pass the threshold. Former Defense Minister Avigdor Liebermanâ€™s Yisrael Beiteinu (â€œIsrael is Our Homeâ€ù) party offers a right-wing approach on security matters with a strong secular appeal and it draws mainly on older Russian immigrant voters. Russians have integrated more and more into Israeli society and Lieberman will struggle to pass the threshold.There are two main ultra-Orthodox parties: United Torah Judaism represents the Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox and Shas represents the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox. Both parties have committed voter bases all but ensuring them tickets into the Knesset.The last party is the surprise of these elections: Moshe Feiglinâ€™s Zehut (â€œIdentityâ€ù) party has shot up the polls based on an original but not fully understood platform that combines Jewish fundamentalism far-right nationalism and economic and social libertarianism. A sideshow just two months ago Feiglin who is accompanied by a maverick ultra-Orthodox rabbi and an anti-vaxxer could be the kingmaker in these elections.Did I forget anyone? I hope not.The publishing of polling data is forbidden in the days ahead of the elections but the last polls gave a fair sense of where most parties stand. Barring an election day surprise the two frontrunners will each take around 30 seats. The right-wing parties however are expected to win more than their left-wing counterparts. Right-wing parties most of whom would sit in a Knesset with Netanyahu as prime minister are expected to win around 65 seats. The parties that would refuse to sit with Netanyahu are expected to win no more than 55 seats. Considering this includes the Arab parties who are not expected to actively partake in any governing coalition this puts Blue and White considerably behind Netanyahu.The president chooses the party he believes has the best chance of forming at least a 61-seat coalition as the ruling party -- and its head as the putative prime minister. This is usually the largest party but not always. Gantzâ€™s Blue and White could win more votes than Likud but lack the backing needed to assemble a coalition. If this is the case Netanyahu will head the next government.However if Gantz wins by a large enough margin -- say 5 seats -- the president would be less likely to offer Netanyahu the first crack at putting together a coalition. Moreover if a number of the smaller parties fall short of the threshold a likely scenario the redistribution of their votes among the parties that did pass could change the entire equation.Therefore Israelis could conceivably wake up Wednesday morning to some unexpected outcomes. Best to wait and see.One possibility to keep in mind is that if Netanyahu is forced to step down due to anticipated indictments we could see a reshuffling of the expected right-wing coalition into a unity government headed by Likud and Blue and White in some sort of rotational power-sharing government.Left right center? Depends what Issue we are discussinNotions like left and right usually connote a partyâ€™s position on security social and economic matters. In Israel we could say the left has traditionally promoted a combination of more government regulation socialist-leaning economic policies secular or liberal attitudes on social-religious matters and actively seeking to end the conflict with the Palestinians and the control over them. Traditionally the right has stood for the exact opposite set of policies with some exceptions among the ultra-Orthodox who never fit these labels.The past two decades have seen a scrambling of these definitions and groupings. Although you still have a left and a right by self-definition you have a significant group of Israelis -- one-third if not more -- who eschew such definitions and place themselves in the less-definable center. Although taking heat from the ideological left and right as being indecisive or simply confused about themselves the new center simply doesnâ€™t fit into existing paradigms.For example we can talk about a right and left as concerns security and the matter of a potential Palestinian state. The left seeks to end the occupation of the West Bank or Judea and Samaria (depending on your political views). It believes Israel can reach a diplomatic agreement with the Palestinian Authority and wants to dismantle outlying settlements (outside of the major blocs which have near-consensus support in Israel). The center would support all of that in theory but doesnâ€™t believe there is a negotiating partner capable of upholding such a deal on the other side. Centrists talk about stopping or even dismantling outlying settlements but retaining military control to preserve the possibility of a future demilitarized Palestinian state. Itâ€™s important to recall that the centrist Blue and White party just happens to be led by three former IDF Chiefs in part to neutralize the rightâ€™s claim that it is the only side that can ensure Israelâ€™s security in a country that can literally go to war at any given time.The right has a range of opinions on this issue. The range starts from essentially what the center believes but with more skepticism; to allowing a sub-state entity with local autonomy; to encouraging migration (with economic incentives); to full annexation and offering either limited-rights residency or even full citizenship to those who swear loyalty to Israel (as a Jewish state of course). These positions shouldnâ€™t be able to exist in the same coalition but they do share one major characteristic: They believe there is absolutely nobody to trust on the other side. They also share the notion that the Palestinians missed their opportunity and will have to settle with less than what was previously offered them. As to Gaza suffice it to say that no mainstream party really knows what to do with the intransigent Hamas and the growing humanitarian disaster in the coastal strip. So far aside from â€œweâ€™ll handle it betterâ€ù nobody is really offering an alternative.Beyond security â€œrightâ€ù and â€œleftâ€ù donâ€™t translate to economic matters or questions of religion and state. This is partly why the â€œcenterâ€ù has come into play as a new construct. Meretz and Avodah certainly represent the classic left. But while Blue and White is centrist on security matters it espouses free-market capitalism on economic issues alongside greater separation of religion and state. Yisrael Beiteinu is â€œrightâ€ù on security matters but â€œleftâ€ù on religion and state. Bennettâ€™s New Right is â€œrightâ€ù on security â€œrightâ€ù on free-market capitalism but â€œcenterâ€ù on religion and state matters. Kulanu and Gesher are â€œcenterâ€ù or â€œrightâ€ù on security matters but support a wider economic and social safety net along traditionally leftist lines. Zehut totally shuffles the cards by offering hard-right security policies alongside a total separation of religion and state.What are these elections really about?Beyond labels there seem to be two main issues at play in these elections -- issues that have been dividing Israeli society for at least four years. The first issue is Netanyahu himself. The prime minister faces indictment in three different corruption and breach of public trust cases in the coming year. These investigations have been ongoing throughout his entire previous term. The public is essentially split on Netanyahu. Clearly a talented and experienced politician Netanyahu has led a campaign to sow public mistrust of the press (all biased leftists) the judicial system (activists leftists) and even the police (out to get him). That the attorney general and former police chief were his own appointments is of little consequence. By bypassing the mainstream press and making deft use of social media Netanyahu has managed to galvanize half of the public behind him against these institutions. Public trust in the press judiciary and police has never been lower. Recall that elections were originally scheduled for November. Netanyahu pushed for early elections seeking to upend the timing of potential indictments and bring public counter-pressure to the impending hearings.Moreover it is no longer clear where Netanyahu stops and the party and government begin. Most of the Likud campaign ads are personally focused on Netanyahu and it is no accident that he is also defense minister as well as foreign affairs and health minister. Is Netanyahu channeling his inner Louis XIV (â€œâ€ù)? Does he believe thatis the state? It's not clear to voters or to the Likud party itself that he can tell the difference anymore. In many ways this election is therefore a referendum on Netanyahu. Indeed there are few practical policy differences between Likud and Blue and White. Netanyahu is the difference.This is no small matter. Many Blue and White voters who might otherwise vote Likud feel that Netanyahu in an attempt to shield himself from his legal woes might trade important political favors to the more extreme religious or nationalist right that could cause deep and long-term changes to the nation's character. Netanyahu supporters on the other hand draw on his real foreign-policy achievements and his personal relations with many world leaders. With Israel surrounded by threats they argue that now is not the time to put political novices at the helm. The allegations of corruption are either overstated or conspiratorial they add and entirely forgivable given the experience and stability Netanyahu brings to the office.But there is a larger issue at stake one that perhaps is drawing the new division between Israelâ€™s left and right: What does it means to be a representative democracy? Does being a democracy mean that the government should reflect the will of the majority of voters or does being a democracy mean safeguarding freedom of press an independent judiciary rule of law and respect for individual and minority rights? The current forces of the new right including the aptly named New Right party and rising stars within the Likud are pushing for major reforms to rein in the judicial activism of the Supreme Court and a greater democratic say in appointing its justices as well as lower-court judges. They also want to give the Knesset the ability to overturn the Courtâ€™s decisions with a special majority. Taken together with the unprecedented attacks on the press and the integrity of the police we can see a clear and new fault-line. The more liberal old guard of the Likud most of which has been slowly pushed out of the party by the more populist new guard is uncomfortable with this development. Indeed one of its most prominent members endorsed the Blue and White party last week.If the outcome is as predicted by most political observers the next government will look a lot like the current one only with more confidence and a stronger hard-right contingent on security and matters of religion and state.As for the region many are anxiously awaiting the Trump administrationâ€™s peace plan expected to be presented following the elections. Parties to the right of Likud have already proclaimed their rejection of any such agreement. Netanyahu seeking to take away last-second votes from his right-wing adversaries stated in a series of rare radio and television interviews that he would seek annexation of (parts of?) the West Bank something he has hesitated to say before. Is this an election-week jump to the right? Or has he abandoned any pretense to supporting a two-state solution? Is he preparing skeptical right-wing voters for political compromise with the Palestinians? Or is he emboldened by recent diplomatic victories such as on the Golan Heights and going for broke? It's hard to know at this point. Keep in mind that it was right-winger Menachem Begin who made peace with Egypt and returned the Sinai Peninsula despite strong opposition on the right and Ariel Sharon who withdrew from Gaza against similar opposition.Whatever happens on the Palestinian issue will surely affect Israelâ€™s regional standing. Israel has taken its once-secret relations with the Sunni Arab world to new levels in recent years. It has been able to do so thanks to Arab fears of a resurgent Iran a regional sense of abandonment by the United States and growing apathy toward the Palestinian cause. But part of that relies at least on the illusion that Israel seeks peace with the Palestinians. Should Israel discard even this illusion the Arabs would be hard-pressed to continue this positive regional trend without risking their own internal political stability.The same holds true for Israelâ€™s relationship with the United States and American Jews. Israel has become more and more of a partisan issue in American politics. There are a number of reasons for this fromÂ domestic political and social trends in the United States to the lack of progress on the Palestinian issue and Netanyahu's openly challenging President Obama to Israel's domestic shift to the right in recent decades. With roughly 70 percent of American Jews being loyal Democrats Israel risks cementing its perceived abandonment of half of America and most of American Jews in order to curry favor with the other half -- a risky strategy in the long run.Given the likelihood that a right-wing government will continue to take hardline stances on matters of religion and state Israel risks further alienating most American Jews who have been able to overlook to some extent the diplomatic stalemate with the Palestinians. Furthermore Israel could find itself continuing along the path of deepening relations with the Trumps Putins Bolsonaros Modis and Orbans of the world at the expense of more moderate leaders. If the Democrats retake the White House Israelâ€™s standing in Washington will surely be affected and American Jews will be more hesitant to come to its rescue as they have done in the past.Right left center whatever -- the outcome of these elections will have more significance than most realize. How this plays out we will find out in the coming weeks. One thing is for certain: If you live in Israel make sure to vote.Dan Feferman is a major (res.) in the Israel Defense Forces where he served as a foreign policy planner assistant to the deputy chief of staff and as an intelligence analyst.

"Despite It All Joe Biden Should Run | RealClearPoliticDespite It All Joe Biden Should RuDespite It All Joe Biden Should RuDespite It All Joe Biden Should RuVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- It will be good for the country and the Democratic Party for Joe Biden to run for president. But it could be hell on him.If Biden backed off from running he would be cast as a martyr to ""political correctness"" and ""the new multiculturalism"" by many of the same conservatives who would do everything they could to defeat him if he won the nomination. Faux sympathy of this sort is starting to appear on the right. It's designed precisely to undercut further advances toward gender and racial equality.Moreover as a noncandidate Biden would hang over the rest of the field like an absent giant who makes everyone else look small. The heart often longs for what it can't have. Instead of being ""too old to run"" Biden would become the missing and longed for ""elder statesman."" Cries of ""Where is Biden?"" would rise up whenever a major candidate stumbled. And God forbid if Trump were reelected we would again live through the ""If only Joe had run"" lamentations.All of this would be disastrous for Democrats and progressives. The only way to know for certain if Biden is in fact the best candidate to beat Trump is for him to get in the race -- to prove that he can appeal to young voters despite his age; to demonstrate that he can navigate a party that has changed dramatically since he first entered the Senate in 1973; and to show he can absorb all the blows that will come his way courtesy of opposition research into his astonishingly long career on the public stage.If he can pass these tests he will be more formidable for it. But to put it gently the experience will not be pleasant. And yes it's entirely fair to ask whether a 76-year-old can successfully navigate our changing mores and win over the younger voters Democrats need.As Paul Starr a professor at Princeton argued shrewdly last week in The American Prospect ""norms and beliefs about race gender and related issues have shifted dramatically among Democrats in recent decades."" As a result ""the very means by which Democrats won elections in the past are now seen as disqualifying by many in the party though not necessarily by the public at large.""Meaning for example that Biden's support for the 1994 crime bill which he could once wave proudly as a banner of toughness is now a liability. Most on the left (and many on the right) see overincarceration especially of African Americans as both a problem and an injustice.And behavior patterns once seen by many as signs of Biden's warm humanity are now condemned as ""handsiness"" or much worse. These complaints are not new but women are less willing than ever to stay silent about behavior most of them disliked in the first place. Last week Biden released a video pledging to be ""more mindful and respectful of people's personal space.""Affection for him is sufficiently widespread among Democrats that he seems to have weathered the latest challenge. But he didn't help himself by joking about the issue (twice) on Friday before a union crowd. And he will be further criticized about how he dealt with Anita Hill's accusations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and about his support for a regressive bankruptcy bill.These are real problems but they will be stacked against Biden's authentic contributions. In June 2008 I made a case for Biden as Barack Obama's running mate. I argued he was a ""happy warrior"" who would reinforce Obama's upbeat appeal. As a Catholic from a blue-collar world the son of Scranton Pennsylvania would strengthen Obama with constituencies where he needed help. Biden's background on foreign policy I said then would enhance Obama's ability to handle national security issues.Since opinion writers often get things very wrong I am grateful that subsequent events ratified my instincts: Biden was an asset in the campaign and throughout Obama's time in office. This still matters to a lot of Democrats.The bottom line is that Biden belongs in this fight. He represents important components of the coalition that will have to come together to defeat the president. He could help Democrats solve a strategic dilemma: How to be tough as nails on Trump while still promising the more harmonious political future that middle-of-the-road voters long for. And if he fails the ultimate nominee will be far better off for having faced down Biden and not be haunted by the ghost of a candidacy that never was.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
Bernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox News | RealClearPoliticBernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox NewBernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox NewBernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox NewVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...One month after the Democratic National Committee declared it would not partner with Fox News for its presidential primary debates leading candidate Sen. Bernie Sandershe would participate in an April 15 Fox News town hall. Those on the left who donâ€™t want Fox to be treated as a legitimate news outlet quickly voiced their disapproval.Carolyn Fiddler communications director of Daily Kos which organized a successful petition calling for the DNC to deny Foxâ€™s requests to host presidential debates told the â€œI donâ€™t know why he would lend his considerable presence to a network that routinely pushes sexist and racist tropes about progressives and his supporters.â€ù Katherine Krueger managing editor of the progressive-- who likes Sanders because he makes â€œthe right people irrationally angryâ€ù -- urged him to reconsider: â€œThe ones who are already tuned into Fox News when that town hall starts arenâ€™t going to move an inch on this pinko socialist.â€ùSanders is correct to ignore the naysayers though perhaps not for the reasons heâ€™s offered.Defending his decision onSanders said going on Fox News will help flip Donald Trump voters: â€œI think it is important to talk to those people and say â€˜You know what? I know that many of you voted for Donald Trump but he lied to you. He told you for example he was going to provide health care to all people; now he wants to throw 30 million people off the health care that they had. He told you that he was going to give tax reform that would not benefit the wealthy; 83% of the benefits go to the top 1%.â€™ I think it is important to talk to Trump supporters and explain to them to what degree he has betrayed the working class of this country and lied during his campaign.â€ùThis is pretty naÃ¯ve if not delusional. Though Sanders is correct that the president has sporadically and inconsistently tacked left on health care and taxes Trumpâ€™s signature issue has always been restricting immigration. Sanders wonâ€™t be saying anything on Fox that will change the average Trump voterâ€™s mind on that score.Furthermore as the shift toward Democrats in the 2018 House election indicates anyone who voted for Trump on the grounds that he would expand access to health care and slap new taxes on the wealthy doesnâ€™t need Bernie Sanders to inform them that didnâ€™t happen.Sandersâ€™ youngest rival South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg had a somewhat more plausible argument for appearing on Fox News himself: â€œThere are so many viewers who may never hear what our party has to say at all if weâ€™re never going on [Fox News] and explaining what we believe.â€ù This may seem fruitless if you assume that every Fox viewer is an immovable blindly loyal right-wing Republican. But in a 2014 study of media consumption by the Fox was the third-most popular news source among people with â€œmixedâ€ù ideological views and for those â€œmostly liberalâ€ù it came in fourth.Granted that doesnâ€™t translate into big portions of the Fox audience. Only 8% of the â€œmixedâ€ù audience and 5% of the â€œmostly liberalâ€ù audience cited Fox as their main news source. Still these numbers are not zero. Considering that Democrats would have won the White House in 2016 if they flippedin three Rust Belt states they canâ€™t be picky about where they go to hunt down hard-to-reach swing voters.But while going out of oneâ€™s way to reach those voters for the general election makes sense the Fox News audience is not a treasure-trove of voters that Democrats need to win the presidential. So whatâ€™s the point of going on Fox at this stage of the process?The answer is: Democratic primary voters should get the opportunity to see how their candidates deal with questions from a conservative perspective even if they are loaded with unfair right-wing talking points.After all the eventual nominee is not going to run in a vacuum. She or he will face plenty of sharp attacks from the right and how well Democrats respond says a lot about how viable they would be in November 2020.said â€œIâ€™m willing to bet serious money that this ends up being a whole bunch of pointed questions about the Green New Deal about why Sanders wants to take away the private insurance we all love so much and about some newspaper column he wrote decades ago with a question about the deficit thrown in for good measure.â€ùWe should hope so! If Sanders doesnâ€™t have good responses to pointed questions about his democratic socialist agenda maybe his agenda isnâ€™t ready for prime time. If he does then he has an even stronger case to make why he should be the nominee and why his agenda should be enacted.The questions for Sanders will likely be pointed but not nasty. The moderators for town hall wonâ€™t be Trump boosters Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson; they will be straight-news anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. As Sanders reminded â€œThe Daily Showâ€ù viewers he did a Fox News town hall in 2016 with Baier who â€œdid it straightforwardly. Believe me we went over the ground rules beforehand and they kept their word.â€ùThat town hall which was coupled with one for Hillary Clinton made news because â€” unlike in the 2016 Democratic debates to date â€” Baier asked a question about abortion. And it was a question that reflected the interests of socially conservative Fox News viewers: â€œCan you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be okay with abortion being illegal?â€ù After Sanders did not name one Baier followed up by suggesting â€œthere are some Democrats who say after five months with the exception of the life of the mother or the health of the baby that perhaps thatâ€™s something to look at.â€ùThis was a heavily slanted phrasing of the question. Democrats werenâ€™t the ones pushing constitutionally questionable abortion bans after 20 weeks without any exemptions for the health of the mother. Republicans were. To assign that view to â€œsome Democratsâ€ù makes the pro-choice position seem extreme.But guess what? Candidates can be asked questions by journalists and even voters with unfair wording. You may not believe this but sometimes a candidateâ€™s opponent levels attacks in an unfair manner. Politics is not always fair! A strong presidential contender needs the skills to turn such questions and attacks to his or her advantage. What better way for a Democratic candidate to show off those skills by tackling head-on questions with a conservative skew?Democrats may not want to legitimize Fox News. But no amount of shunning is going to make it go away. The Democratic nominee will have to function in a world in which Fox exists and conservative talking points are well amplified. Keeping the Democratic presidential candidates coddled in a partisan cocoon during the primary is not going to prepare the eventual primary winner for what is to come.Bill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show â€œThe DMZâ€ù and host of the podcast â€œNew Books in Politics.â€ùÂ He can be reached at contact@liberaloasis.com or follow him on Twitter @BillScher.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
"Republicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' Signs | RealClearPoliticRepublicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' SignRepublicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' SignRepublicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' SignVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Although the Democratic National Committee has not allowed Fox News to host a Democratic primary debate since 2004 the DNC recently made a show of boycotting Fox for the 2020 presidential cycle.Some conservatives have expressed outrage over this slight but another question is why havenâ€™t Republicans taken similar steps against CNN and MSNBC? In November 2015 I wrote a column â€œA debate that will live in infamyâ€ù which excoriated CNBC for its sneak attack on the top 10 Republican candidates for president at the time. That column (reprinted in) called the debate a â€œblatant attempt to manipulate public opinion by insulting the standard-bearers of the Republican Party.â€ùI donâ€™t think Fox News would sink quite that low if it were permitted to host a Democratic debate but then Iâ€™m not a Democrat. It should be obvious to everyone however that Republicans have not learned the lesson to be wary of the left-wing media.An interview of Hogan Gidley on ""MSNBC Live With Hallie Jackson"" last week was the latest case study in how stupid it is for any Republican for any conservative and especially for any Trump supporter to ever appear on a network like MSNBC (or as should be obvious CNN).Of course I'm not breaking news here when I say that but as a journalist I keep hoping reporters will treat the people they interview with respect and fairness and make all their subjects feel equally at ease and/or nervous regardless of political affiliation.That's certainly not what I witnessed last Tuesday when Jackson mauled (er interviewed) Gidley deputy press secretary for President Trump (seen at 11:45 of this). I kept hoping Gidley would push back his chair and walk off the set in disgust but I knew that if he did it would just be click bait for Democratic trolls and late-night hacks (er comedians). Once you make the mistake of handing matches to the angry mob you have no choice but to stand patiently until they finish burning you at the stake.Gidley probably knew he made a mistake as soon as Jackson introduced him by saying that he had â€œdeigned to join us here on set.â€ù He acknowledged her insult by saying dryly â€œI do deign.â€ùJackson began by grilling Gidley about whether the White House would turn over to Rep. Elijah Cummings information related to how security clearances were granted to 25 people. (A White House mole er Deep Stater had given the list to Cummings in a ploy to create a post-Russia distraction.) Although it was clear after the first time the question was answered that the White House was not going to cooperate with Cummings' fishing expedition for some reason Jackson could not absorb this information. She asked the question a second time then a third on each occasion implying that Gidley was not answering her question which he plainly was.â€œThis precedent would make it possible for members of Congress anytime they want to make a political point and play political games to bring that [confidential] information forward. That is absolutely ridiculous and weâ€™re not gonna play that gameâ€ù Gidley said to Jackson who then pretended that heâ€™d dodged the question.It was at this point that I started to reflect on the fact that Jackson was no longer a reporter but rather a Democratic operative. Being aggressive is a good trait in a reporter. Being the devil's advocate is a necessary tool of being a good interviewer. But I could not recall any instance in recent memory where a reporter on MSNBC had used the same tactic against a Democrat.After moving on from the security-clearance issue Jackson claimed that President Trump had reversed course (or â€œpuntedâ€ù) on Obamacare. The president had said he wanted Congress to replace Obamacare which a federal judge had ruled to be unconstitutional but he later explained that a vote would not come until after the 2020 election. This confused members of the media including Jackson who donâ€™t understand that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats who wonâ€™t vote with the president to replace Obamacare. Gidley calmly explained the issue and said what Trump wants to accomplish but Jackson kept arguing with him.She also accused both Trump and Gidley of lying. She claimed the president said he was â€œjust kiddingâ€ù about health care. He didnâ€™t. When she started talking about aid to Puerto Rico she said the president was lying about how much aid has been pledged to that beleaguered island. â€œThese are things that are not trueâ€ù she said repeating Democrat talking points as if they were the gold standard for objective truth. (If you believe that I have a secret Russian dossier I want to sell you!)The coup de grace though came later when Jackson saved the final segment of the interview for shaming Gidley for having misspoken earlier by calling Puerto Rico a country rather than a territory. Generally a good reporter will just correct an interview subject by letting them know that they had misspoken. In this case Gidley apologized and said it was a â€œmistakeâ€ù which Jackson then characterized as â€œa slip of the tongue.â€ù This gave her the opening she was looking for.â€œDo you think thatâ€™s a concern that there is that kind of slip of the tongue inside the White House?â€ù she said.â€œNo that was a slip of the tongueâ€ù Gidley patiently explained. â€œItâ€™s not on purpose Hallie. That would by definition be a slip of the tongue.â€ùAs the interview ended I hoped that Gidley had learned his lessonÂ  â€” a lesson that Steve Bannon tried to instill in the Trump White House two years ago when he called the mainstream media â€œthe opposition party.â€ù But unfortunately this is apparently a hard lesson to learn. The president continues to allow himself to be interviewed by the New York Times and Hogan Gidley will probably be back on MSNBC within the month.Rhetoric about the â€œdishonest mediaâ€ù aside as long as Republicans show endless patience with the left-wing media they will continue to â€œdeignâ€ù to be made to look like fools.Frank Miele the retired editor of the Daily Inter Lake in Kalispell Mont. is a columnist for RealClearPolitics.
