However Trump was still the Republican candidate which makes it amazing that a speaker would backstab his nominee in such a way.', 'Ryan can be heard on the audio sayin', 'â\x80\x9cI am not going to defend Donald Trump â\x80\x94 not now, not in the future,â\x80\x9d Ryan can be heard saying.', 'This is not good for Ryan especially considering how much trump’s supporters hate Ryan and the Republican establishment.These revelations give validity to the likes of Steven Bannon, who has always warned Trump of the dangers that Paul Ryan presents.', 'A spokesperson for Ryan told Breitbart that the audio is nothing new, saying, “The world is well aware of this history. … And obviously a lot has happened since then. As everyone knows.”', 'A Full Transcript Of Ryan’s Comments can be see below.', 'â\x80\x9cHis comments are not anywhere in keeping with our partyâ\x80\x99s principles and values, There are basically two things that I want to make really clear, as for myself as your Speaker. I am not going to defend Donald Trump â\x80\x94 not now, not in the future. As you probably heard, I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend â\x80\x94 a thing I do every year. And Iâ\x80\x99m not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days, Look, you guys know I have real concerns with our nominee.Â\xa0I hope you appreciate that Iâ\x80\x99m doing what I think is best for you, the members, not whatâ\x80\x99s best for me. So, I want to do whatâ\x80\x99s best for our members, and I think this is the right thing to do. Iâ\x80\x99m going to focus my time on campaigning for House Republicans. I talked to a bunch of you over the last 72 hours and here is basically my takeaway. To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. Some of you are not, But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide whatâ\x80\x99s best for you. And you all know whatâ\x80\x99s best for you where you are. But the last thing I want to do is to help Hillary Clinton get the presidency, and get Congress. Look, sheâ\x80\x99s a failed progressive. Sheâ\x80\x99s running an abysmal campaign. I mean, itâ\x80\x99s just â\x80\x94 itâ\x80\x99s amazing how easily she could be beaten, She will take this country in the wrong direction. And the last thing we need is four more years of Obama policies or two years of a Clinton presidency with a Democrat Congress. Could you imagine what that would look like? So the last thing we want to be doing is giving Hillary Clinton a blank check in Congress. Thatâ\x80\x99s why Iâ\x80\x99m going to spend the rest of this month fighting for Congress, fighting for our majorities, Iâ\x80\x99m going to spend the next 28 days working hard with all of our members to get re-elected because we need a check on Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump and Mike Pence donâ\x80\x99t win the presidency, Greg Walden will get more into what that looks like and what polling looks like, but I want to basically close with this: His comments are indefensible, theyâ\x80\x99re not in keeping with our principles, so Iâ\x80\x99m not going to try to defend him. Iâ\x80\x99m going to focus on Congress, Iâ\x80\x99m going to focus on upholding our values. We have a great, great policy agenda â\x80\x94 A Better Way â\x80\x94 that we need to take to voters and show what our party actually stands for and what itâ\x80\x99s stood for for generations.â\x80\x9d', 'Rachel Maddow is blaming her viewers for the Trump tax debacle â\x80\x93 hereâ\x80\x99s why!', 'Trumpâ\x80\x99s budget director shocked liberals with blunt answer on climate change!', 'Frantic search for Secret Service STOLEN laptop containing Trump Tower floor plans!', "' + arr_splits[i] + '", '" + formated_str + "']
