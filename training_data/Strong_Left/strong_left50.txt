Shortly before it was passed, Republicans made a last-minute motion to pass another clean extension of VAWA, but their motion was defeated.  ', '"Ending violence against women and protecting women and children should not be a partisan issue. But unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have made it a partisan issue. They have refused to work with Republicans in a meaningful way," said Republican Rep.
