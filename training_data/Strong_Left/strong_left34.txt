Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman, penned an essay last week detailing a 2014 encounter during which the former vice president made her feel "uneasy, gross and confused" when he came up from behind her and kissed the back of her head. Several women have since come forward with similar stories about Biden.', 'Biden used humor during his speech on Friday in reference to the allegations.

You know, social norms have begun to change, they\'ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it, I get it."', '"I hear what they\'re saying, I understand it, and I\'ll be much more mindful, that\'s my responsibility.
