They also want Barr to explain how he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided Trump's actions did not meet the standards for prosecuting an obstruction of justice case.", 'Barr wrote Friday that he does not think it\'s in the public interest for him to summarize Mueller\'s full report, nor does he plan to release sections in "piecemeal fashion."', '"Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own," Barr added Friday.', 'Barr further confirmed that the Justice Department and special counsel\'s team are working to redact four types of information from the report: grand jury material, sensitive intelligence material, information that involves ongoing investigations, and "information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties."', "But the redactions Barr is working on won't satisfy Democrats.", "House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York issued a statement Friday responding to Barr's letter by insisting that Democrats want the full Mueller report without redactions.", '"As I informed the Attorney General earlier this week, Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report, without redactions, as well as access to the underlying evidence, by April 2. That deadline still stands," Nadler said.', 'When they spoke by phone this week, Nadler asked Barr to work with the committee to ask the courts to make grand jury information public, according to a Democratic aide who said Barr would not commit to doing so. Democrats argue there is precedent for releasing grand jury material, and the aide said they see that as the "primary obstacle" to making the full Mueller report public.', '"Rather than expend valuable time and resources trying to keep certain portions of this report from Congress, he should work with us to request a court order to release any and all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee — as has occurred in every similar investigation in the past," Nadler said. "There is ample precedent for the Department of Justice sharing all of the information that the Attorney General proposes to redact to the appropriate congressional committees."', 'Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, accused Nadler in a statement Friday of setting arbitrary deadlines for Barr to release the report, and said Nadler\'s demand for Barr not to redact grand jury and other information amounted to calling for "the attorney general to break the law by releasing the report without redactions."', 'The Justice Department is likely to miss the Democrats\' April 2 deadline, though House Democrats have not yet said what they will do afterward. Nadler said he would take Barr\'s proposed May hearing date "under advisement," but also added: "We feel that it is critical for Attorney General Barr to come before Congress immediately to explain the rationale behind his letter, his rapid decision that the evidence developed was insufficient to establish an obstruction of justice offense, and his continued refusal to provide us with the full report."', 'Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, meanwhile, said of Barr\'s letter: "I look forward to hearing from Attorney General Barr on May 1."', 'This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.', '9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202', 'The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card deb', 'Transfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202', 'Fly practically free with these 3 travel card', 'Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credi', "How to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)", 'Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1,608/m', "Need cash?
