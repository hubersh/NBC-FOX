Each is a set of texts that lawmakers can copy and adapt\xa0for introduction as bills\xa0in\xa0their own statehouses. Model bills, many of which\xa0amount to wish lists for special interests, have become pervasive in the American legislative process, an investigation by USA TODAY, ', ' and the Center for Public Integrity found.', 'Copies of models were introduced nationwide more than 10,000 times in an eight-year span, the investigation found, amounting to\xa0perhaps\xa0the largest unreported\xa0special-interest campaign in American politics.', 'ALEC models were introduced nearly 2,900 times, in all 50 states and the U.S. Congress, from 2010 through 2018, with more than 600 becoming\xa0law,\xa0the\xa0USA TODAY and ', "Among groups that produce fill-in-the-blank legislation, ALEC's influence\xa0was second only to the Council of State Governments, a nonpartisan group that provides state governments with research and guidance on policy.\xa0CSG saw more than 4,300 bills based on its models\xa0introduced, and 950 become law, according to the analysis.", 'The ALEC formula was on display in the summer of 2017, when 1,40', 'state lawmakers, lobbyists and corporate staff from across the country descended on a downtown Denver hotel.\xa0', 'There were exhibit booths, work sessions, rousing speeches\xa0and activities to entertain the family members who had come along.', 'There were also reminders everywhere that corporations were picking up the tab.\xa0\xa0', 'At a kickoff luncheon, as attendees dined on regal crest chicken and cheddar\xa0Yukon\xa0potatoes inside a dimly lit ballroom, the blue ALEC logo flashed across a giant screen along with the sponsors’ logos: UPS, CenturyLink, Anheuser-Busch, Farmers Insurance, Chevron, AT&amp;T, and pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co.\xa0', 'Attendees got a dose of motivation from well-known conservatives who urged them to take back control of the states from the federal government and transform the country, statehouse by statehouse, by reducing taxes and removing regulations.\xa0 \xa0', 'U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, who founded the American Federation for Children, which also pushes school-choice model bills; publishing executive Steve Forbes; and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich made appearances.\xa0\xa0', 'Gingrich\xa0has\xa0called ALEC “the most effective organization” at spreading conservatism and federalism to state lawmakers.', 'Access for a few thousand dollars\xa0', 'ALEC was created in 1973 in Chicago by a small group of conservative activists and state legislators. Their\xa0broad\xa0goal was\xa0to support conservative\xa0ideas and make it easier to disseminate policies\xa0that advanced their cause at the\xa0state\xa0level.', "Today, private-sector members\xa0pay at least $12,000 to join, with some paying much more depending\xa0on the level of access they seek, said Bill Meierling, ALEC's chief marketing officer\xa0and executive vice president.\xa0", 'Joining an ALEC\xa0task force, where\xa0model legislation is drafted and debated behind closed doors,\xa0costs an additional $5,000, he\xa0said.', 'Most private-sector members pay\xa0between $12,000 and $25,000 a year, Meierling said. (ALEC had $10.3 million in revenues with $8.9 million coming from donations and grants, according to its nonprofit tax form in 2016.)', "Lawmakers,\xa0meanwhile, pay $100 for a two-year membership and can\xa0solicit donations to cover the\xa0cost of attending annual meetings, depending on rules in their state. They can also apply to ALEC for travel reimbursements, Meierling said, which ALEC funds through additional corporate donations. While ALEC encourages families to participate, it only reimburses lawmakers'\xa0conference costs, he said.\xa0", "Lisa Graves, co-director of Documented Investigations, which probes corporate manipulation of public policy, said corporations and corporate lobbyists'\xa0see a big return on their investments in ALEC. It’s often much cheaper than coordinated campaign contributions or direct lobbying and can\xa0have a much bigger impact, she said.", '“For the amount of\xa0money\xa0they pay to be a part of ALEC, to get this voice … and to get this equal vote on ALEC task forces, in some cases it’s only $10,000\xa0a year, which is nothing for these corporate lobbyists,” she said.', 'ALEC has claimed that its members introduce more than 1,000 bills based on its models each\xa0year and about 20% become law, according to media reports and\xa0ALEC internal documents.\xa0', ' found ALEC’s model bills became law 21% of the time, in line with ALEC’s estimates.', 'ALEC\xa0model bills are conjured up by lawmakers, lobbyists and\xa0corporate executives, or sometimes drawn\xa0from other\xa0organizations\xa0seeking\xa0a wider audience for their\xa0ideas.\xa0\xa0', 'The group guards drafts of its\xa0fill-in-the-blank legislation like trade secrets, distributing them only to members deemed trustworthy. Members are discouraged from taking cellphone photos of drafts to reduce the chance they leak.\xa0', 'During the Denver conference, an ', ' reporter was prohibited from observing task-force deliberations, where lawmakers and lobbyists discuss ideas for model legislation and vote on whether it should get ALEC’s seal of approval.', 'Lawmakers and lobbyists periodically emerged from those meetings to take phone calls or grab a fresh-baked pretzel and soft drink at a “hospitality suite” sponsored by the Consumer Technology Association. None would talk publicly about the process.\xa0', 'Each task force has a public chair,\xa0usually a state lawmaker,\xa0and a private chair,\xa0typically an industry representative.\xa0The meetings are\xa0similar to\xa0legislative committee hearings. And like legislative committees, they are assigned\xa0specific\xa0topics: Education and Workforce Development;\xa0Energy, Environment and Agriculture;\xa0Tax and Fiscal Policy.\xa0', 'But there’s\xa0one fundamental difference: At ALEC, the votes of corporations and lobbyists are equal to those of elected lawmakers.', 'The Civil Justice task force,\xa0for\xa0example, is led by Missouri state Rep. Bruce DeGroot and Mark Behrens, whom ALEC identifies on its website as an attorney with Shook, Hardy and Bacon.', 'Behrens’ law firm represents companies with millions of dollars at stake in asbestos litigation. Some of the ALEC models approved by the task force he chairs reduce the liability of companies facing asbestos claims. And lawmakers who introduce those bills have called Behrens to testify as an “expert” witness at least 13 times, USA TODAY\xa0found after reviewing documents on asbestos models in dozens of states.', "Meierling said only legislators can introduce ideas for model legislation. If the task force approves their idea, it then goes to ALEC's board. Made up solely of lawmakers, the ALEC board\xa0has\xa0the final say on what becomes model legislation, he said.\xa0", '"There\'s no rubber stamp here," Meierling said. "If it passes the board, it becomes an ALEC model. Many do not."', 'ALEC is still king of the model bill game.', '(Photo: Andrea Brunty, The Arizona Republic)', 'Not just lawmakers looking to ALE', "Legislative staff — including those whose job it is to write bills for lawmakers — attend ALEC's conferences too.", "The Arizona House of Representatives, where Republicans have held the majority\xa0for decades,\u202fspent $10,000 to send six staffers to ALEC's 2017 conference in Denver. Arizona introduced at least 209 bills copied from ALEC models,\xa057 of which\xa0became law. Only one other state, Mississippi, debated and passed more ALEC models, according to USA TODAY's analysis.", 'Joe Walsh, a former data scientist at the University of Chicago who has tracked the spread of model legislation, said\xa0legislative\xa0staffers naturally\u202flook for fill-in-the-blank bills from groups aligned with\u202fthe prevailing\u202fideology\xa0in\xa0that statehouse.', '"Mississippi is hiring someone who is more likely to find a bill from (the conservative) ALEC than from (the liberal\xa0model factory) ALICE," Walsh said, referring to the prolific model legislation groups. "So\xa0it is probably not\xa0just from the legislators themselves."\xa0', '\xa0investigation bears that\xa0out. In Mississippi, where lawmakers have introduced at least 255 ALEC\xa0bills — the most in the country — two Republican lawmakers said they used staff members at the Legislature to copy model legislation.', 'Michael Watson, a\xa0Mississippi\xa0state senator, introduced at least 56 copycat bills according to the investigation, 22\xa0of them from ALEC, including on charter schools, school vouchers,\xa0and calling for a constitutional convention to limit federal\xa0spending.', 'Watson acknowledged that he copies model bills and said he\xa0often\xa0requests\xa0them\xa0through legislative\xa0staff.', "“We go down to our attorneys in Legislative Services\xa0and say, 'Here are the issues I want to cover. I know several other states have done this, so there’s\xa0some kind of boilerplate\xa0language out there. Let’s pull in the good pieces and put some legislation together.’”", 'After ‘Stand Your Ground,’\xa0ALEC under fir', 'ALEC saw its influence fall in the wake of the 2012 slaying of Trayvon Martin in Florida. George Zimmerman, a self-appointed neighborhood watchman, shot and killed Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African American. The shooting sparked nationwide outrage and\xa0scrutiny of\xa0Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law,\xa0which ALEC turned into a model bill based on\xa0the Florida statute.\xa0', 'That law,\xa0which was cited by one of the jurors who found him not guilty,\xa0allows people who feel a reasonable threat of death or bodily injury to meet force with force\xa0rather than retreat. Passed in 2005, it was sponsored by two ALEC members and pushed by the National Rifle Association. Months later, ALEC’s Criminal\xa0Justice Task Force produced “Stand Your Ground” model legislation.', "“Frankly, I think it’s really under-reported ... who is driving these,” said Kim Haddow, director of Local Solutions Support Center, which challenges model legislation created to override local governments’ ability to enact policies. “There’s a reason there were 20 'Stand\xa0Your\xa0Ground' laws appear all at the same time, because it was written by ALEC and introduced by ALEC members.”", 'The incident focused outrage\xa0on the use of model\xa0legislation, as well as ALEC, whose low profile had been key to its success.', "Liberal critics publicized ALEC's corporate members\xa0and\xa0its\xa0methods\xa0for\xa0spreading policy. An avalanche of companies cut ties with\xa0ALEC, including Walmart, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Coca-Cola Co., Kraft Foods, McDonald’s Corp., and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.", 'ALEC eliminated the task force that developed "Stand\xa0Your\xa0Ground."', 'Copy, Paste, Legislate: A visual introductio', 'Used car dealers didn’t want to fix deadly defects, so they wrote a law to avoid i', 'Stand your ground, right to work and bathroom bills: 5 model bills that spark controvers', "What is ALEC?

It currently has about 900 models, Meierling said. The USA TODAY/', ' investigation used 1,120 ALEC models to search for copied legislation, including some ALEC has\xa0retired.\xa0', '"Every five years, we actually go through everything to make sure that we are updating things for the times or, more often than not, sunsetting policies that no longer make any sense," Meierling said.\xa0', 'Despite the backlash, ALEC has remained\xa0an influential force in legislatures nationwide.\xa0\xa0', 'Some lawmakers said ALEC’s ability to connect lawmakers with like-minded businesspeople is its greatest strength.\xa0', '“What you have seen is corporations saying, ‘Hey, we have an opportunity to have influence at the state level,’” said Debbie Lesko, an Arizona Republican and ALEC champion during her time in the state Senate and state House of Representatives.', 'Lesko said she\xa0joined ALEC as a freshman lawmaker\xa0at the urging of Arizona Senate Republican leadership.\xa0', '“The benefit is that there’s a source for legislators from all over the country to see what other states are doing,” she said.\xa0“If a legislator wants to use that as a template (for a\xa0bill) … if they think it’s a good idea, they can change it or modify it instead of reinventing the wheel.”', 'While in the Arizona\xa0Legislature, Lesko introduced 31\xa0bills copied from model legislation, the USA TODAY/', ' analysis found, with 18 of those bills coming from ALEC. They included\xa0legislation barring local governments from limiting short-term rentals, calling for the liberal group ACORN to be audited, calling for a constitutional convention,\xa0and mandating cities and states enforce immigration laws to crack down on “sanctuary cities.”', 'Hertel-Fernandez,\xa0the\xa0Columbia University\xa0professor,\xa0said model bills are\xa0particularly valuable for less-experienced lawmakers, who “know they are conservative, they know they are pro-business, but ... they don’t really know what it means to translate that into different bills.”\xa0', 'Carrying that legislation furthers\xa0a\xa0relationship\xa0that can\xa0bring long-term benefits, he said.\xa0', '“They approach you when you are first elected and build these enduring social connections with you at recurring events that happen every year,”\xa0he said. “You really need that social connection in addition to the model-bill resources that you’re getting, the research help."\xa0', 'Graves, of Documented Investigations, said those relationships can come with ongoing financial support for lawmakers’ campaigns.', 'Lesko dismissed\xa0the\xa0frequent criticism that the organization gives corporations an outsize voice in the legislative process.\xa0As a state lawmaker, she said,\xa0she gave\xa0equal weight to ideas from her constituents and non-business groups.', 'Lesko\xa0left the Legislature last year and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.', "Among the top donors to Lesko's congressional campaign, according to opensecrets.org, were\xa0four companies with ties to ALEC.", 'Nick\xa0Penzenstadler\xa0of USA TODAY and Giacomo Bologna and Luke\xa0Ramseth\xa0of the\xa0Missisippi Clarion Ledger contributed to this article.', 'Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2019/04/03/alec-american-legislative-exchange-council-model-bills-republican-conservative-devos-gingrich/3162357002/', ' He specializes in using data to drive investigative reporting.
