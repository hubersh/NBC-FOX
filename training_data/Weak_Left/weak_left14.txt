Rockland County Executive Ed Day\'s reliance on executive law in issuing the emergency declaration "may have been misplaced," the decision stated.', 'Thorsen agreed with the families\xa0who sued to the county over the state of emergency when they said their children would\xa0continue to miss school, and the parents would continue to incur monetary expenses as a result of the order. The families asserted that the\xa0children posed no threat to other children at a school where there had\xa0been no reported cases of the measles.', 'Michael Sussman, attorney for several dozen parents whose unvaccinated children attend Green Meadow Waldorf School in Chestnut Ridge, said the decision showed the judge agreed with his contention that the emergency declaration "is an improper vehicle for an over-broad order of this sort."', '"We expect all schools in the county, where children who have religious\xa0exemptions and have been barred ... will be returned to school so they can continue their education,"\xa0Sussman\xa0said late Friday afternoon.', "Although Thorsen's order\xa0is\xa0temporary, the fate of the state of emergency is unclear. The county has the option of\xa0filing\xa0papers in advance of\xa0an April 19 court appearance, but by then Day's\xa030-day state of emergency would be almost done.", 'Day expressed disappointment in the ruling but maintained his belief that the order made a difference.', '"While today’s ruling by Judge Thorsen did not go as we had expected I want to commend those here in Rockland who have used this State of Emergency as an opportunity to get vaccinated and have conversations with their friends and neighbors about vaccination," he said in a statement. "We sought to find a new way to fight back against a disease that was eradicated almost 20 years ago and refused to sit idly by while those in Rockland were put at risk."', 'NY legislators move to end religious exemptions from vaccine', 'County Executive Ed Day, right, and Commissioner of Health Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert give an update regarding the effects of the State of Emergency Declaration in New City on Friday, March 29, 2019.', '(Photo: John Meore/The Journal News)', "Thorsen ruling followed Thursday afternoon's arguments in a pair of\xa0lawsuits brought by parents\xa0whose unvaccinated children have been affected by the state of emergency instituted March 26 by the county executive.", 'The order was intended to put the brakes on\xa0a measles outbreak that had reached 167\xa0cases since October\xa0when a traveler from Israel visited the county. Most of the cases have occurred in the insular\xa0Orthodox and Hasidic communities in the Monsey and Spring Valley area.', 'In addition to prompting hundreds of people to get vaccinated, the state of emergency has drawn worldwide attention and has landed the county in the middle of debates\xa0over civil and religious rights connected with childhood\xa0vaccinations.', "Thorsen's decision agreed with Sussman's lawsuit\xa0filed Wednesday claiming\xa0the families had been irreparably\xa0harmed by the\xa0order barring their children from school and\xa0restricted their travel, activities and daily routines.", "The children all have religious exemptions to vaccinations, which are recognized by state education law but are prohibited under Day's state of emergency order.", 'The parents, who are only identified by their initials, claimed Day overstepped his authority in using\xa0an\xa0emergency declaration meant for quelling a disaster or other one-time\xa0event\xa0and not an ongoing health emergency. It additionally states that the individual orders comprising the declaration can only be issued for five days without being renewed.', '"What\'s significant is the overreach involved, the indefensibility of it," Sussman said after Thursday\'s court hearing.', 'There are nearly 400 reported cases of measles in the USA. What are states doing about it?', 'Attorney Michael Sussman speaks outside the Rockland County Courthouse after a hearing on the Rockland County state of emergency because of measles April 4, 2019.', '(Photo: Peter Carr/The Journal News)', 'Sussman reiterated his contention that the emergency order is simply a case of grandstanding by public officials.', 'He added: "People\'s lives are being affected even though they are not in any way themselves carriers of the disease, they are not affected by the disease. But the people who are affected by the disease are not being quarantined even though they are a much smaller number. That\'s the way to proceed."', 'But Rockland County Attorney Thomas Humbach,\xa0representing the county executive, told the judge:\xa0"To try to quarantine at this point, we would have to open a sanatorium."', 'Humbach argued that Day had invoked\xa0the state of emergency legally and appropriately in\xa0response\xa0to a\xa0crisis that was likely much larger than\xa0the 166 reported cases indicated.', '"The number of cases that we know about is different than the number of cases that there are," Humbach\xa0said during Thursday\'s hearing. "There are estimates that the number cases that there are outnumber the cases that we know about by two to four thousand."', 'Rockland County Attorney Thomas Humbach and attorney Patricia Finn outside the Rockland County Courthouse after a hearing on the Rockland County state of emergency because of measles April 4, 2019.', '(Photo: Peter Carr/The Journal News)', 'The county attorney\xa0argued it was imperative to balance the liberties of some people with the need\xa0to stop spikes of a\xa0highly contagious virus he said were popping up across the county and not just in isolate areas.', "Without the ban, there's a risk it could spread among\xa0infants and the infirm with\xa0serious complications like encephalitis, Humbach\xa0warned.", "Measles outbreak: How Rockland County became ground zero – then hit the 'third rails' with emergency declaratio", 'During Thursday\'s hearing, Thorsen asked Humbach: "Where does an outbreak end and an epidemic begin?"', 'Humbach replied that the words are similarly used, and said the numbers of measles cases and destruction caused by them warranted the situation to be labeled an emergency.', "The judge also asked Humbach whether the county's order could have been more narrowly tailored instead of how widely it was applied.", 'Humbach said the county had considered narrowing the ages and locations to\xa0schools and houses of worship but had decided otherwise.', 'Afterward, he said "it is not the county executive’s job to cater to individuals.\xa0The county executive is responsible to the entire populace of the county and is using the powers granted to him by the law to take the course he deems fit to protect the population as a whole. ...\xa0In this case, the good of the many must outweigh the preferences of the few, or the one."', 'Another lawsuit filed Wednesday on behalf of an unnamed Rockland County mother and her unvaccinated baby daughter, also targets the county for failing to quarantine people with measles.', 'Attorney Patricia Finn speaks outside the Rockland County Courthouse after a hearing on the Rockland County state of emergency because of measles April 4, 2019.', '(Photo: Peter Carr/The Journal News)', "The lawsuit filed by\xa0lawyer Patricia Finn alleges Day's emergency\xa0order discriminates against people with religious exemptions to vaccinations\xa0and\xa0violates their religious freedom by keeping them from celebrating\xa0Easter or Passover in houses of worship.", 'Finn is a Piermont attorney who represents clients who have been injured by childhood vaccines\xa0and specializes in cases involving religious and medical exemptions to vaccinations.', '"The pharmaceutical companies are dominating the media," Finn told the judge.\xa0"They\'re scaring people and the county executive is reacting to that."', 'Finn\xa0argued before Thorsen against the safety and efficiency of the measles, mumps, rubella\xa0vaccine itself.', 'But Humbach said Finn\'s claims were "not science and medicine accepted by medical establishments."', '"In the balance between religion and science, the courts state\xa0that public health comes first," he said.', 'Rockland County Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert has continually promoted\xa0', 'the safety and efficacy of the measles vaccin', " and reminded the public of the\xa0potential severity of the virus' complications.", 'The health commissioner said last week that some\xa017,600\xa0MMR vaccinations had\xa0been given since the beginning of the outbreak in October – a number has increased by almost 700 since the\xa0state of emergency was declared.', 'Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/05/measles-vaccinations-new-york-countys-emergency-order-halted-judge/3381970002/']
