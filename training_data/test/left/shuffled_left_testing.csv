Pelosi is quick to point out she has never lost a major vote on the House floor. She hasDemocratic support this year on most major House legislation â although the measures are largely messaging vehicles because theof passing the GOP-controlled Senate.hammered on the campaign trailast year for being a San Francisco liberal but in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY she embraced the label as a way of showing her partyâs left wing she is one of them before asking them to move toward the center.âIâm a progressive from San Francisco. I think I can have some credentials on the left as a person who has represented a very liberal cityâ Pelosi said last month in Ferguson.âBut you have to govern mainstreamâ she added.USA TODAY spent the day traveling with Pelosi in St. Louis and FergusonÂ as she joined Rep. Lacy Clay D-Mo. to promote policies that unite Democrats: expanding voting rights job growthÂ and cleaning up corruption in government. Even though the trip followed weeks of Democratic infighting and botched messaging in Missouri none of those issues came up.Pelosi is leading her most diverse caucus yet.Some liberals such as freshmen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. proudly embrace socialism want sweeping action on climate change andÂ callÂ for a government-run health care system. Ocasio-Cortez a social media star saidÂ Democrats compromise too much and has called out party lawmakers who vote with Republicans.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with Cathy Jenkins the owner of Cathy's Kitchen in Ferguson Mo. Rep. Lacy Clay who represents Ferguson is in the background March 18 2019.(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Fear of the socialist labelDemocrats in competitive districts runÂ as far as they can from the socialist label. They want to focus on what they campaigned on: lowering health care costs bolstering infrastructure and spurring jobs growth. They are willing to work with Republicans. Rep. Josh Gottheimer D-N.J. who co-chairs the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus said that in divided government âthe key is actually moving the ball forward which requires us working with both sides.âPelosi is trying to bridge those viewpoints. In a nod to each wing of the party she said Democrats should fight for the âboldest common denominator.ââWhile there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers whatâs important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the Houseâ Pelosi said. Ocasio-Cortez hasWhen USA TODAY asked how more liberal members responded when she told them they needed legislation that could pass she responded âTheyâre fine.""âAs I say to my own district âYou go out and elect 218 people just like San Francisco then we can talk' ""Â she said.Democrats captured the House majority in November 2018 by winning seats in districts starkly different from deep-blue San Francisco. VotersÂ there backed Hillary Clinton overwhelminglyÂ against Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections. In her reelection bid in 2018Â Pelosi captured 87% of the vote. But more than twoÂ dozen Democratic House members represent districts that Trump won in 2016 some by double digits includingÂ Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson whose district the president carried by 31%.Pelosi 79 is holding the speakerâs gavel for the second time. Sheâs the highest-ranking woman elected in politics. Her colleagues say being a mother of five and a grandmother of nine shows in how she interacts with people. She can be both âlovingâ and âtough as nailsâ according to Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos who leads Democratsâ campaign arm for the 2020 reelection. Bustos has experienced both sides as a member of leadership who is from a Trump district.During every encounter in Missouri Pelosi tried to forge a personal connection with constituents and activists. She held the hand of an employee giving a tour of a childrenâs health center. She elicited laughs during a town hall including former prisonersÂ when she teased their teacher himself a former inmate after he compared himself to Denzel Washington. SheÂ lingered long after the handshake in conversations with the former prisoners.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi speaking to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis March 18 2019.(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Other stories you may like:Congressional Democrats question AG William Barr's decision that Trump didn't obstruct justicDemocrats' strategy on Mueller report: Steer clear of impeachment talk about health carShe has long had a reputation for toughness. In December she won plaudits from her party for confronting Trump in the Oval Office over his demand for a wall along the southern border.But personal relationships are the key for Pelosi in trying to hold together a caucus that is even more ideologically divided than it was during her tenure as speaker from 2007 to 2011.Is the shifting Democratic Party ""a problem for her that she needs to manage? Yeah it probably is"" said Paul Becka political science professor emerituBeck said it's crucial that Pelosi doesnât leave âsome of these moderate Democrats many of whom were replacing Republicans kind of out to dryÂ and very vulnerable to Republican attacks in the 2020 election.""Republicansâ strategy for targeting vulnerable congressional Democrats centers on linking them to the agenda of far-left liberals such as Ocasio-Cortez.Many freshmen Democrats who flipped GOP seats in November ran far away from liberal priorities such asÂ ""Medicare for All""Â a national program that would guarantee health insurance for every American. Dozens vowed to oppose Pelosi for speaker after Republicans held her up as a symbol of liberal policies. Pelosi didnât take it personally. âJust win baby"" she said in May 2018.Pelosi told USA TODAY she has been able to keep her caucus together because she understands her members and their districts. Observers in both parties saidÂ she knows exactly what members want. That knowledge has allowed her to flatter threaten and just simply wear them downÂ until she has the support needed.In March as Democrats awaited the results of special counsel Robert Muellerâs investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election some in the party talkedÂ of impeaching Trump. Pelosi urged cautionthat impeachment would be a âgiftâ to the president if Republicans werenât on board. She dismissed demands for a stronger stance onÂ impeachment: âThey wanted to impeach the president since the day he got elected.âAfter Muellerâs investigation wrapped up with a finding that there was no collusion with Russia most Democrats have followed Pelosi andÂ put impeachment talk aside.Pelosi ""is the most gifted strategic person Iâve ever met when it comes to politics. If youâre in her crosshairs sheâs your most formidable opponent and if sheâs on your side and with you sheâs able to do magical thingsâ said Joe Crowley the former Democratic Caucus chairman who lost his seat in New York last yearÂ in a primary upset by Ocasio-Cortez.When you walk into Pelosiâs office youâll find two products from her San Francisco district: bowls of Ghirardelli chocolate (dark her favorite) and a stack of San Francisco Giants baseball bats. The bats lean against a dark brown cabinet where four TVs play C-Span feeds of the House and Senate floors along with MSNBC and CNN.Former New YorkÂ Rep. Steve Israel a Democrat who has worked closely with Pelosi likens the chocolate and bats to her leadership style.âWe can do this the sweet way or we can do this the hard way. But weâre going to do thisâ said Israel who led the House Democratsâ campaign arm in 2012 and 2014.When Pelosi arrived at the first stop in the St. Louis area a tour of a childrenâs health center Rep. Clay gave her some local dark mint chocolates.âI like to do it the sweet wayâ Clay said laughing. âShe will pressure you if you donât agree with the direction that she wants to take our caucus.âShe can be very persistentÂ and insistent. She just keeps hammering on her pointâ he said.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi arrives to take a tour of the Lacy Clay Center for Childrenâs Health in St. Louis Mo. March 18 2019 along with Congressman William Lacy Clay D-Mo. right. Pelosi is holding a gift from Clay which includes dark mint chocolates.-(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Pelosi laughed off Israelâs chocolate and bats metaphor. âIâm a sports fanâ she said.There are examples of the tactic as recently as the end of last year. Dozens of candidates and incumbents said they would not support her for speaker. But shein January with only 15 defections.In late 2018 Rep. Marcia Fudge of OhioÂ briefly considered challenging Pelosi for speakerÂ but opted against it. She was given the chairmanship of a new subcommittee. By contrast Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York a longtime Pelosi critic pushed for new leadership and refused to vote for Pelosi. Later when the former prosecutor lobbied to join the Judiciary Committee she was blocked by Pelosi and her allies according to two sources familiar with the incident.Mirror of the tea party?Some Republicans acknowledged Pelosi's success in holding her caucus together.But based on their own experience they arenât sure how long it will last. They suggested cracks are emerging that remind them of the tea partyâs rise on their side âÂ and the headaches the faction posed for former Republican Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan.Â ( in part over frustration dealing with the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. Wisconsinâs Ryadid not run for reelectioâItâs similar to what we as Republicans dealt with when we were in the majority. You have an ascendant left that is very angry very bluntÂ franklyÂ a little irresponsible in the things they say. And the base soaks it upâ said former Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello a GOP moderate who retired last year. A DemocratÂ holds his former seat.âI think itâs kind of like Groundhog Day but now itâs a different color. Itâs a blue groundhogâ Costello said.Some grassroots liberals demandÂ that Pelosi put proposals such asÂ the Green New Deal aimed at climate changeÂ and Medicare for All up for a vote even if they stand no chance of passing the GOP-led Senate and being signed into law by Trump.Alexandra Rojas executive director of Justice Democrats a group that helped launch Ocasio-Cortezâs congressional bid calledÂ on Pelosi and other Democratic leaders to âembrace the grassroots energy thatâs in the Democratic base right nowâ â or give up the post to someone who will.Pelosi said there were no plans to bring up the Green New Deal because it wasInstead she pointed out that she created a select committee to address climate change and she said other panels would work on the issue as well. House Democrats introduced a more modest bill that would put the United StatesÂ back intotheÂ Paris Climate Agreement afterÂ President Trump withdrew.The Rules and Budget Committee will hold hearings on Medicare for All but Pelosi has made no commitment to bring it to the floor for a vote.âWhile Iâm very supportive of shoring up the Affordable Care Act right away I simply donât think that we get to our final conclusion without a Medicare for All billâ said Rep. Pramila Jayapal D-Wash. who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Jayapal said she supports rejoining the Paris climate accord butÂ there was much more to be done to address an âurgent crisis.âSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi listens to Fathers Support Center of St. Louis CEO Halbert Sullivan who founded Fathersâ Support Center in St. Louis March 18 2019.(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Jayapal said she wants to persuade members that more liberal policies can be popular in their districts but âI donât believe in shaming for the most part.â She said polling by the Progressive Caucus shows many voters in districts that Trump won are receptive to Medicare for All and other left-leaning policies.Rep. Stephanie Murphy D-Fla. a co-chair of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition expressed skepticism and said using âtalking pointsâ to sell a liberal agenda was not the answer to winning seats in moderate districts.âI got an econ degree and one of the truisms is that you can find data to support any theory you want. It depends how you ask the questionâ Murphy said.âOur members got elected in really tough seats red to blue seats seats that Trump won because they understood their constituentsâ she said. âLetâs give them the respect they deserve to represent their communities the best way they know best how.âThe Florida Democrat said moderates are concerned about health care and climate tooÂ but they want to make sure the legislation has a chance of making it through the GOP Senate and onto the presidentâs desk.âI think we can address these issues looking at the problem in smaller piecesâ Murphy said.In Missouri the day went smoothly. Back in Washington Pelosi and Democratic leadership have not been so lucky. Internal divisions have grabbed headlines even though House Democrats easily passed theirÂ signature priorities.Green New Deal dies in Senate and Democrats helped kill iDonald Trump takes victory lap over Mueller result. Will it help him in 2020?When Democrats cleared the first major piece of legislationÂ in25 yearsÂ on background checks for firearmÂ 26 moderates voted with Republicans to amend the bill to require turning over undocumented immigrants to the government if they try to buy a gun. Pelosi and liberals scolded those who crossed party lines behind closed doors. Ocasio-Cortez told membersshe had alerted left-wing activistthat 26 Democrats were responsible for the amendmentsâ passageÂ according to two aides in the room.When asked about the incident Pelosi said the GOP amendments formally known as âmotions to recommitâ and designed to put members of the majority in uncomfortable positions were simply âproceduralâ and ânot anything that is worthy of our conversation.âMore thanÂ a week later all Democratsvoted toÂ passÂ House Resolution a billÂ focused onvoting rights and congressional ethic. In the days before the vote the partyâs message on the legislation was overshadowed by a controversy over comments made by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar who said Israel demands ""allegiance"" from U.S. lawmakers. Republicans and some Democrats saidÂ the remarks played to anti-Semitic tropes by questioning the loyalty of American Jews.Jewish members wanted the House to immediately vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. Several liberal members pushed for a broader resolution condemning all forms of hate and said it was unfair to single out Omar.Â It took days before Democrats finally passed a broadÂ anti-hate resolution.Â Omarâs name was not included. Some Jewish members were disappointed at what they felt was a watered-down measure. Other Democrats were frustrated the debate had dragged on so long.âI wished she would have moved quicklyâ said Jim Manley a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. But Manley said he understood why it took so long: âSuch a diverse caucus youâve got to take everybodyâs opinions into account.âPelosi said she thought the resolution turned out as it should have and listening to all members was a positive despite the time it takes.âI think we came out very strongâ she said.Contributing: William Cummings and Christal HayeEyes on the prize: In poll Democrats care more about victory than ideology in 2020 nomineExclusive: Nancy Pelosi vows 'different world' for Trump no more 'rubber stamp' in new CongresPelosi spends the day in Missouri charming her supporterA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis she was in Missouri as part of her seven-city tour across the country focused on promoting the Democratic agendNancy Pelosi during a tour of the Lacy Clay Center for Childrenâs Health in St. Louis.Nancy Pelosi speaks to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. LouiNancy Pelosi speaking to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis along with Congressman William Lacy Clay (D-Missouri) center and Fathers Support Center of St. Louis CEO Halbert Sullivan who founded Fathersâ Support Center in 1997 with a mission to provide noninvolved fathers the support they need to get back into the lives of their children as positive productive parents.Nancy Pelosi at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis along with Congressman William Lacy Clay (D-Missouri).Nancy Pelosi at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis.Nancy Pelosi speaking to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis with Fathers Support Center CEO Halbert Sullivan.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Lobbyist Sam Patten provided ""substantial assistance"" to special counsel Robert Mueller and several other ongoing investigations federal prosecutors said Monday paving the way for him to potentially avoid jail time at his sentencing this week.The case has been full of intrigue from the beginning givento several prongs of Mueller's investigation. He founded a company with a suspected Russian operative steered foreign money to President Donald Trump's inauguration was closely tied to Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and advised the controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica.Prosecutors from the US attorney's office in Washington didn't recommend a sentence for Patten who first came under investigation by Mueller's team. Heto illegally lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party that favors closer relations with Russia.The prosecutors said Patten's cooperation was ""immediate"" and ""substantial."" They told the judge that Patten deserved leniency and formally requested a reduction in his sentence.""Patten has met with government investigators in person or by phone a total of nine separate times to answer numerous questions and explain various documents"" prosecutors wrote. ""In all of these sessions Patten has been honest and straightforward with government investigators.""But almost all of the details surrounding Patten's ""substantial"" assistance will remain secret for now. Both sides said they would submit additional filings under seal with that information.The court filings revealed that Patten provided evidence against Manafort and was prepared to testify against Manafort at trial. Prosecutors said Patten's experience as an overseas political constant made him a ""valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities.""For his part Patten asked for probation instead of prison. His lawyers said he never intended to cover up anything related to Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. When he pleaded guilty Patten admitted that he illegally funneled money from a Russia-friendly oligarch to Trump's inauguration fund and that he lied about it to a congressional committee.""His crimes were not motivated by greed or a desire to conceal relevant information from the American public or to aid or cover up any potential interference with the 2016 Presidential election"" they wrote. ""To the contrary Mr. Patten's decisions in this case stemmed primarily from a desire to accommodate his clients' requests and to present himself in the best possible light after unexpectedly finding himself a subject of the Russian interference investigation.""That $50000 donation was a tiny fraction of the $107 million raised by Trump's inaugural fund. But federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkthat committee for a slew of potential crimes including fraud money laundering and conspiracy. It's not clear if Patten helped with that investigation whichThe contribution was not part of a broad effort to inject foreign funds into Trump's inauguration his lawyers said. Patten didn't even like Trump and opposed him in 2016 they added.""Mr. Patten did not support the Trump campaign and while he may have known people who worked for the campaign at various times he had no personal connection to it"" his lawyers wrote. ""Indeed Mr. Patten not only openly opposed the Trump candidacy but even broke with his party when he voted for President Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election.""In his first public comments about his crimes Patten submitted aexpressing remorse and describing how his actions triggered a ""very dark"" period for him and his family.""In the eight months since I pleaded guilty before you and more than a year since this journey began for me I have changed"" Patten wrote in the two-page letter which was dated March 28. ""To an even more meaningful degree than the day the FBI came to my door I have surrendered. But in admission and surrender I have also come to know a certain peace.""Patten who said in court last year that he was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression has given up drinking and attended more than 150 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous since his guilty plea his lawyers said. They submitted 45 pages of letters asking for leniency from Patten's family friends his AA sponsor and even his childhood babysitter growing up in Maine.A sentencing hearing for Patten is scheduled for Friday. Overseeing the case is Judge Amy Berman Jackson who handled Manafort's case and several other Mueller prosecutions. Patten's sentencing waswhile he cooperated with investigators.This case is unique as Patten pleaded guilty to a crime that is rarely prosecuted by the Justice Department. Onlyhave been charged in the past 50 years with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act a federal law that was enacted shortly before World War II.The small number of comparable cases means Berman Jackson will have ""even broader discretion"" than usual when she decides Patten's fate on Friday prosecutors noted. The maximum potential sentence is five years in prison and a $250000 fine though a much less severe outcome seems likely in this case.Patten's foreign client was the Opposition Bloc a Ukrainian political party that favors close ties with Russia. The party was formed by allies of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych after he fled the country amid unrest in 2014. Patten and Manafort worked for some of the same clients and Manafort wasin prison for crimes relating to his own lobbying.CNN's Kara Scannell contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Mark Halperin tried to make a comeback on Michael Smerconishâs radio show  - VoLog In or Sign UMark Halperin says his conduct has changed. His commentary is the same.His first interview post-#MeToo included a pretty sexist assessment of the 2020 field.Mark Halperin says his conduct has changed. His commentary is the same.Mark Halperin wants to come out of the #MeToo cold after 17 months.Mark Halperin swears heâs changed his personal conduct since he wasaccused of sexually harassing or assaultina dozen women and I certainly hope that is true. But his public conduct as a political pundit which is also important has not changed.on Sirius XM radio with host Michael Smerconish a prominent #MeToo critic and said heâs sorry for how heâs hurt women and said he understands now why âit is so painful for a woman or a man in the workplace to be harassed by someone.âin front of a young woman pressing an erection through his clothes ontoand slamming a woman into a wall among other things while he was the political director of ABC news. Halperin denied these specific accusations but apologized at the time to women he said he âHe launched into an assessment of the 2020 Democratic field and made a series of sexist assessments and omissions that were the hallmark of his commentary for many years.For example throughout the episode he offered his thoughts on a number of the men in the race but none of the women. His assessments werenât all positive but by talking about just male candidates he defined the scope of who he thinks is important and who is not. Given this was his first attempt to rehabilitate himself it was a glaring omission.He also downplayed Joe Bidenâs kicking things off saying that the coverage is âa bit of a distraction.ââThis latest problem I think is getting a lot of attention but it is far from his only problem and in terms of pure politics and winning the nomination far from his biggest problem.âHalperinâs point that Biden has run and lost before is a valid critique but it does not require dismissing the conversation around his conduct as unworthy of attention. Itâs the kind of remark that makes victims of abuse not speak out because they believe they wonât be believed or wonât be taken seriously. (Several women who say Biden made them uncomfortable have specifically said they did not speak out sooner for this very reason.)Halperin moved on to gush over Pete Buttigieg praising him in a way thatshows boosts male candidates and harms female candidates. Ambition is perceived as a positive quality in men and negative quality in women. âHeâs got the personality and driveâ Halperin said offering no explanation of what that means in any case.â[Buttigieg has] what a lot of John McCain supporters felt which is people want to be part of something thatâs larger than themselves and I think that the mayor of South Bend makes people feel that wayâ Halperin said. âHe makes people at the grassroots feel that way and he makes elite donors feel that way. A lot of the elite donors care about the country Iâd say most of them do and heâs appealing to them.âHalperinâs opinion used to matter. His newsletter was once called theâmost influential tip sheet in Washington.â He directed political coverage at ABC. He went on to write two best-selling books on the 2008 and 2012 presidential racesHe was omnipresent on cable news for years.So while he considers himself an outsider watching the passing show his critics have long said heâs also a participant who shapes how we think. And when it came out that he abuses women the media was forced to contend with the work of a man whose behavior shows he does not respect women.As my colleague Ezra Kleinat the time about Halperin and a handful of other powerful men in media: âThe most influential institutions in America have long had serial sexual abusers and deep misogynists at their apex. Those abusers didnât just shape their workplaces or their industries; they shaped our politics our culture and our country.âabout how Halperin specifically shaped 2016 describing Hillary Clinton as âa grasping and scandal-plagued woman.â Yet he once argued âthe sexual-assault claims leveled at Trump would only help the now-presidentâs brand.âPolitics has changed since Halperinâs hiatus. A historic number of women are running for the Democratic nomination. A historic number of women ran and won in the midterm elections. But it doesnât seem like Halperinâs own views have changed along with the times.The original version of this story reported that Mark Halperin was accused of masturbating in front of several young women while he was the political director of ABC News. He was accused ofmasturbating in front of one womaaccused him of pressing erections through his clothes against them without their consent. Halperin denies these specific accusations.Rep.

Trump administration sued by states over unhealthy school lunches  - VoLog In or Sign UTrumpâs administration let schools serve unhealthy lunches again. States are suing.The states argue that the lax nutrition regulations are a threat to studentsâ health.Trumpâs administration let schools serve unhealthy lunches again. States are suing.A New York public school serves lunch on March 11 2019.Six states and Washington DC led by New York Attorney General Letitia James are fighting President Trumpâs mission to make school lunches unhealthy again.During the Obama administration first lady Michelle Obamafor healthier school meals as part of her agenda to tackle obesity. In 2010 Congress passed legislation requiring school lunches to be more nutritious and the Department of Agriculture published new regulations to enforce the law.those guidelines in 2018 allowing schools to abandon their commitment to lowering sodium and increasing whole-grain foods. Nowto set the standards high again.The main argument from the coalition of states which includes New York California Illinois Minnesota New Mexico Vermont and the District of Columbia is that these revised requirements will harm childrenâs health especially low-income students of color who rely on school lunches for a nutritious meal.The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act passed by Congress in 2010 required schools to only provide grain products that contain at least 50 percent whole grains and reduce sodium full-fat milk and meat from meals. Snacks with low nutritional value were to be swapped out for fruit cups and granola bars.Although the legislation passed with bipartisan support Republicans soon turned against the law citingthat kids were throwing out their healthier but less tasty lunches. Some schools also complained they were struggling to keep up with the stricter standards.New policies under Trumpâs administration pushed back against the legislationâs stringent requirements and by 2018 the Department of Agriculturrefined grains in lunches for half of the weekly meals and loosened the requirements on reducing sodium. They also permitted schools to serve flavored 1 percent milk. Only fat-free milk could be flavored under the Obama rules.The lawsuit focuses on three key changes from 2018: the reintroduction of refined grains and two of the changes meant to gradually reduce sodium from school meals.This isnât the first time states have sued the administration due to disagreement over policies.

She said he would be replaced by Assistant Director James Murray.The White House offered no explanation for the director'sÂ removal.Alles who disputed that he was firedÂ is expected to leave his post next month.âNo doubt you have seen media reports regarding my 'firing'"" the director said in an internal message to staffers. ""I assure you that this is not the case and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security.Â The president has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction.Â It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the workforce prior to this announcement.""Alles took office less than two years ago as the serviceÂ emergedÂ from a series of White House security breaches and incidents of agent misconduct. A senior official who is not authorized to comment publicly confirmed that the director was informed two weeks ago that the White House was making the change.Â The person said his ouster was part of a broader leadership shakeup throughout Homeland Security.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned Sunday night. President Donald Trump rescinded his nomination ofÂ Ron Vitiello to head U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying he wanted to go in a ""tougher"" direction.Nielsen and Alles were part of a leadership team assembled by White House chief of staff John Kelly who previously ran the Homeland Security Department. Kelly a retired Marine Corps general had close ties with Nielsen. Alles himself a former Marine major general served as the acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under Kelly.The official saidÂ Alles' removalÂ was not related to last week's arrest of a Chinese national who penetrated security checkpoints at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida carrying a cache of electronics thatÂ included a malware-infected thumb drive.That incident prompted the FBI to beginreviewing whether the president's resort could be vulnerablto foreign spying. A government official familiar with the inquiry said it was opened out ofÂ ""an abundance of caution"" as it was unclear what threat if any the womanÂ Yujing Zhang represented.A Secret Service agent on the White House lawn.Asked last week whether he was concerned about the security breach Trump betrayed no indication that he was mulling a change at the Secret Service lavishing only praise on the agency.""Secret Service is fantastic"" Trump said Wednesday. ""These are fantastic people. ...Â I would say I could not be happier with Secret Service.Â Secret Service has done a fantastic job from day one.Â Very happy with them.""During his brief tenure overseeing a staff of 6500 and a $1.6 billion budget Alles won legislative approval to compensate more than 1000 agents for hundreds of hours in unpaid overtime as they sought to protect Trump's large family.Alles pushed for the additional compensationÂ after USAÂ TODAY first reported thatthe agency could not pay hundreds of agentwho had reached federally mandated caps on salary and overtime allowancesÂ as the agency grappledÂ with protecting aÂ president and his extended family who travel frequently.Exclusive: Secret Service depletes funds to pay agents because of Trump's frequent travel large familUnder Trump the service protectedÂ an unprecedented 42 officials up from 31 during the Obama administration. The number includedÂ 18 Trump family members.Alles acknowledged the president's large family in anÂ interview with USA TODAY but said there was ""no flexibility""Â in the service's mandated protective responsibility.""I can't change that""Â he said.Before he was named to replace Alles Murray was responsible for the planning andÂ coordination of the agency's protective mission. In that role Murray presided over presidential and foreign dignitary protection;Â special nationalÂ security events including the annual State of the Union address;Â and the protection of critical national facilities.Murray joined the service in 1995 as a special agent in the New York field office where he conducted cyber-related financial crimeÂ investigations and served and worked on a terrorism task force.Â In 2001 Murray was appointed to the Presidential Protective Division and promoted as the deputy special agent in charge of presidential protection.In Alles' message to staffers he described Murray as a ""true leader"" and urged the agency to support his appointment.""It has been my great honor to serve as director of the U.S. Secret Service"" Alles said.President Donald Trump says the Secret Service has done a great job since day one.Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/white-house-removes-secret-service-director-continuing-homeland-security-upheaval/3402033002/",1
Fighting the Assaults on Net Neutrality and Our Economy | Freepress.orFighting the Assaults on Net Neutrality and Our EconomyLetâs all take a moment to savor this great grass-roots U.S. Senate victory in Alabama of Democrat Doug Jones over alleged child molester Roy Moore. Letâs also celebrate the victory of the moderate Ralph Northam over the extremist Republican Ed Gillespie to be governor of Virginia and a possible flip of the Virginia Legislature with the influx of a strong contingent of progressive women.Breathe deep. Stretch up your arms. Shout for joy.Now letâs use all that great new energy to fend off Donald Trumpâs twin assaults on net neutrality and our core economy.Losing could leave us blind and impoverished. So donât even think about it.On Trumpâs tax scam we have at best a few days.A mass movement already is in place to save the internet.Thursdayâs vile 3-2 FCC vote tohas long been expected. Mass demonstrations community organizing court challenges an attempt at a congressional reversal and much more are in motion.Magical Thinking Is Stopping Us From Taking to the StreetThis is new territory a fight for control of. The alternative to winning is brain death.As for the GOP tax scam the clock is ticking.The Senate version passed 51-49 on Dec. 1. The House-Senate reconciliation committee wants a new version rubber-stamped next week. Despite the billâs immense impact thereâs been a complete lack of public hearings orItâs not likely thereâll be enough Republican votes in the House to stop it.In the Senate we need just three.The likeliest is Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker the only Republican to vote ânoâ last time. Trump has punked him with a stream of personal insults. Corker is not running for re-election. Like all other potential swing votes he is no doubt being promised the world to vote âyes.â. She voted against gutting Obamacare. Her first âyesâ vote on the tax bill reportedly was based on promises from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Medicare and Social Security would be protected. But co-perpetrator and House Speaker Paul Ryanâs life mission has been to destroy both. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio among others proudly proclaims that this will start the process.Why anyone would believe anything the GOP leadership says is hard to fathom. Maineâs struggling elder community among others has displayed great anger including heated demonstrations at Collinsâ office and her public appearances. She must know that if she votes âyesâ again she will drown forever in an unforgiving grass-roots tsunami.Arizonaâs Jeff Flake has been yet another target of Trumpâs venal abuse. Flake dramatically announced he wonât run for re-election. But then he votedArizonaâs John McCain did the same. The âGreat Maverickâ cast the decisive vote to save Obamacare. Heâs been undergoing what must be a hugely expensive course of treatment for brain cancer.This may be among the last votes McCain casts and itâs likely a death sentence for millions of Americans who canât afford the kind of health care heâs been getting. Does he care?Ron Johnson of Wisconsin hinted at opposing the first draft based on its rough treatment of small business. But apparently his good friend Paul Ryan found Johnsonâs price.Alaskaâs Lisa Murkowski voted against destroying Obamacare. But sheâs ecstatic about this billâs death sentence for the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge where her biggest donors want to drill for oil and further heat the planet.Maybe other Republicans can be turned. Trumpâs minions surely have scoured every GOP wish list. And they have no intention of waiting for Doug Jones to take his seat.But somewhere somehow amid the warm glow of the Alabama turn we must find a way to stop this bill.Here are just a few reasons why:â It enacts one of historyâs most blatant thefts of essential resources from working- and middle-class Americans to the rich and super-rich. Trump himself would profit.â It worsens the kind of wealth gap that fed the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed.â It guts Obamacare leaving tens of millions without medical coverage while facing needless diseaseâand possibly deathâfor themselves and their children.â It opens the all-out GOP assault on Medicaid Medicare and Social Security with the impoverishment of millions sure to follow.â It attacks public education with massive supports for private schools that will profit Trump cronies like Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.â It ends teachersâ ability to deduct what they spend on supplies for their students.â It taxes graduate studentsâ scholarships tuition waivers and other essential steps to advanced degrees slashing whatâs left of our professional education system.â It lets tax-free churches engage in partisan campaigns allowing mega-rich donors to launder âpurchasesâ of âpiousâ candidates.â It slashes support for wind power solar energy electric cars and other âSolartopianâ advances while funding massive new tax breaks for obsolete planet-destroying King CONG (coal oil nukes and gas).Trumpâs âtax reformâ and internet assault are at the cutting edge of a suicidal war being waged by the psychotic rich against the rest of usâand the planet.We are in Koyaanisqatsi: life out of balance. The center is not holding. Our social and ecological fabric is giving way. Our survival is at stake.These turning-point elections in Virginia and Alabama give us hope.Now the gritty substance of the war for our ability to communicate and for the core of our life support systems is in a different kind of play.Like those elections these are conflicts we cannot afford to lose.,1
Marine General Shreds Integrity Image in Defense of Trump | Freepress.orMarine General Shreds Integrity Image in Defense of TrumJohn Kelly backs president with lies evasions irrelevancies â not truthat motivated White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to bring himself to the White House briefing room October 19 only toperform something like a self-immolation?He began with abrupt fuzziness:Well thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note so I just wanted to perhaps make more of a statement than an â give more of an explanation in what amounts to be a traditional press interaction.OK not clear what that might mean reporters understood that he was there to defend President Trumpâs handling of his suddenlyto Sgt. La David Johnsonâs widow and mother of three comforting her with âyour guy â¦ must have known what he signed up for.â Kelly is not in the habit of engaging with reporters but he had been a witness to the call. So the next thing he said was:Most Americans donât know what happens when we lose one of soldiers sailors airmen Marines our Coast Guardsmen in combat. So let me tell you what happensâ¦.Wait this is not relevant to Trumpâs tone-deaf effort at empathy. Nobodyâs asking what happens to the fallen in combat. Thatâs easily found out by the curious. Why is he leading with this red herring? He goes on with his explanation:Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud puts them on a helicopter as a routine and sends them home. Their first stop along the way is when theyâre packed in ice typically at the airhead. And then theyâre flown toâ¦.Kelly is telling us whatâs supposed to happen. He probably telling us what often happens. He is absolutely not telling us what happened to Sgt. Johnson. Kelly had just said âwhen weone of our soldiers.â That was a tipoff consciously or otherwise. During the ambush Sgt. Johnson and several Nigerien soldiers were literally lost. No one knew where they were for a couple of days. We donât know who found Sgt. Johnson or how. We donât know if anyone wrapped his body in ice. We do know that his body was so decomposed that an open casket was not appropriate. Kellyâs recitation of by-the-book treatment of military casualties was not only irrelevant it was misleading. And in the midst of this distraction Kelly tossed in another deceptive aside:A very very good movie to watch if you havenât ever seen it is ââ where this is done in a movie â HBO setting. Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me and itâs worth seeing that if youâve never seen it.All of a sudden the White House chief of staff isfrom 2009. Whatâs his point? See Widow Johnson maybe thereâs a movie deal in your future? So what wrong with this? For starters the movie isabout the feelings of the colonehome to Wyoming in 2004 complete with fawning media coverage at the time. Sgt. Johnson got different treatment.But then thereâs this weird sentence from Kelly: âChance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me and itâs worth seeing that if youâve never seen it.â Syntactically Kelly seems to be saying that itâs worth seeing Phelps 19 getting killed right next to Kelly in the heat of combat â what Kelly apparently means is that itâs worth seeing the movie. But still what is that âkilled under my command right next to meâ all about? Itâs all about a sort of true thing that Kelly distorts into falsehood. Phelps was in a unit guarding a convoy that came under fire. Gen. Kelly was somewhere in the convoy. The official story is that Phelps was wounded while defending the convoy as it got away; somehow he dies later. Another story came from US Naval Hospital. Corpsman Doc Peabody: âI am the corpsman who was sitting next to PFC Phelps when we got hit on April 9th 2004. I was sitting right next to Phelps in the vehicle as the enemy initiated the ambush. I am convinced that Chance died instantly but his head was in my lap and cradled in my arms just seconds after he was hit.âThereâs not much of a story in that and this was 2004 when the Bush administration desperately needed heroes to keep selling its travesty of a war in Iraq and PBS was happy to help. And so was HBO. âTaking Chanceâ is a reverent look at idealized treatment of military dead and generals have been grateful for the sycophancy ever since. Kellyâs long-winded recitation of âwhat happens when we loseâ a soldier is an idealized echo of a Hollywood fantasy sponsored by the Pentagon.In the midst of these layered diversions from what actually happened to Sgt. Johnson in Niger Kelly adds the irrelevancy of how he felt when his son was killed and his sonâs buddies called him. He abruptly segued into his half-baked non-defense defense of Trump:If you elect to call a family like this it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. Thereâs no perfect way to make that phone call. When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it my first recommendation was he not do it because itâs not the phone call that parents family members are looking forward to. Itâs nice to do in my opinion in any event.Kelly went on to say that President Obama had not called him but that âwas not a criticism.â Then he said âI donât believe President Obama called.â Kelly did not mention that Obama invited him to a dinner at the White House. Finally Kelly got to the calls to next of kin of the four soldiers killed in Niger on October 4 again drifting into details of military protocol. And when Kelly finally addressed the substance of the calls he said he advised Trump to use the insensitive formulation that makes emotional sense only to a deeply militarized mindset. Kelly said to tell the dead soldierâs survivors that:â¦ he was doing exactly what he wanted when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because weâre at war. And when he died in the four cases weâre talking about Niger and my sonâs case in Afghanistan â when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.So a mind-numbed former general advised his insensitive president to go with a hard truth laced with a self-deception most likely a lie. Kelly just lays it out there: the four dead in Niger are just like his son in Afghanistan. How many ways is that just not true? The US has been at war in Afghanistan since 2001; thehas come as a surprise to most people. Kellyâs son was the child of a general serving his third tour of duty. Sgt. Johnson joined the Army in 2014. He had a wife and family at home and a congresswoman who had known him as a child.It is a common delusional fantasy to suggest that âhe was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed.â No when he was killed he was trying to survive. The greater glory is all in someone elseâs head. In the metaphorical sense perhaps a career soldier like Kellyâs son was doing what he wanted that got him killed but was that true of any of the sergeants killed in Niger? And how would anyone know? Sgt. Johnson hadnât joined the one percent like Kellyâs son and he had not signed up forthat got him killed thanks to decisions made higher up the chain of command which has been engaged in a butt-covering exercise in finger-pointing ever since. Kelly really doesnât want to talk about what happened or why the Pentagon wonât say what happened or why the Pentagon and Niger military have different versions of what happened or who was responsible for four dead Americans and uncounted (by the US) Nigerien soldiers all travelling in unarmored non-military vehicles.Contrary to Kellyâs kneejerk rainbow patriotism Sgt. Johnson did not die âsurrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.â Sgt. Johnson died surrounded by Nigeriens he hardly knew. He had no friends nearby when he died. He was left on the battlefield for two days without being reported missing and when he was found Nigeriens found him. Kelly may even believe the military mythology he spouts but that hardly makes it true or relevant or even decent in relation to Sgt. Johnson. But Kelly doubled down on the shibboleths of coercive patriotism as applied to Sgt. Johnson:â¦ he knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. Thereâs no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.That is the language of emotional numbness that is the lie that lets generals live with themselves and that is a widespread self-delusion that enables the US to go on and on and on killing people in most of the other countries in the world. âThere is no reason to enlistâ says Kelly clearly contradicting his own rhetoric about service and duty. Maybe his sons felt that way or maybe they had an obdurate general for a father. But even in a volunteer army most soldiers are there because they have no better choice to bring hope to their lives. Thatâs not a good thing thatâs a sad thing â a raw indictment of American culture.Then Kelly launched into his vituperative andon Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida. Kelly flatly misrepresented the Congresswomanâs appearance at the dedication of an FBI building in 2015. Kelly was there; he was a witness to what happened. Four years later his version of what happened was wrong. What he remembered or said he remembered was not what the videotape of the event showed. Not even close. So does Kelly have memory problems of some sort? Does he not have enough integrity to vet his opinions against reality? Did he just lie and carry out a deliberate political smear? He gave us a clue to his state of mind:It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. You know when I was a kid growing up a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred looked upon with great honor. Thatâs obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life â the dignity of life â is sacred. Thatâs gone. Religion that seems to be gone as well.A good psychiatrist could unpack that passage for years. Why does Kelly think a widow canât have anyone she wants to comfort her especially during a cold call from her president? Why does Kelly suggest something sneaky â âlistened inâ â when the congresswoman was clearly invited to be present and the call was heard on speakerphone by five or six people? Kelly says he is âstunned.â He said that frequently in this appearance. Is this a measure of his insulation from the real world that he expects everyone to live by some unspoken military code?And then thereâs the bombshell about being a kid growing up and things being sacred. He grew up in Boston where one of the demonstrably sacred things was white racism. Kelly doesnât mention that. He starts with the male chauvinist classic: âWomen were sacred.â Right especially Catholic women for whom autonomy was all but a venal sin. Kelly turned 10 in 1960 and was apparently stunned to see his sacred cows challenged: womenâs rights civil rights human rights and peace activism. Ironically Kellyâs life in the sixties including hitchhiking cross-country riding freight trains back and joining the Merchant Marine where his first overseas trip was taking beer to Vietnam. He even chose to avoid the draft â but it was by joining the Marines.And now here he is saying that women are no longer âlooked upon with great honor â¦ as we see from recent cases.â He names no one but this skates stunningly close to his pussy-grabbing boss. He laments the loss of âthe dignity of lifeâ by which he presumably means a womanâs right to make her own medical decisions. A broader meaning of âthe dignity of lifeâ is hardly possible for a man whose career depends on killing people. Kellyâs career is prima facie evidence of his complicity in torture and other war crimes including the use of depleted uranium weapons white phosphorous and the indiscriminate killing of civilians. All those are virtually sacred to the military mentality. Kelly laments the loss of religion but thatâs his religion and itâs far from gone.Answering a few questions after his statement Kelly bobbed and weaved about the Niger mission that got Sgt. Johnson killed. Kelly keeps saying how wonderful our soldiers are doing what they do. He offers not a shred of apparent regret at their deaths. As Kelly sees it with stunning incoherence and self-contradiction American soldiers:â¦ put on the uniform go to where we send them to protect our country. Sometimes they go in large numbers to invade Iraq and invade Afghanistan. Sometimes theyâre working in small units working with our partners in Africa Asia Latin America helping them be betterâ¦. Thatâs why theyâre out there whether itâs Niger Iraq or whatever. We donât want to send tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines in particular to go fight.So why do we send them to fight anyway to fight and die in wars that never end wars that never should have begun? Why do we threaten new wars with North Korea or Iran or even Russia? How does that âprotect our countryâ exactly? Kellyâs âpatrioticâ delusions are widely held. Theyâve been driving national policy for decades and on steroids since 9/11. But like Kellyâs appearance in the press room the expression of these delusions never makes sense; they always come down to a question of faith preferably blind faith. And with that as we see in Kelly goes a sense of priesthood a sense of superiority masked by disingenuous false humility:We donât look down upon those of you who that havenât served. In fact in a way weâre a little bit sorry because youâll have never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kinds of things our service men and women do â not for any other reason than they love this country. So just think of that.Yes think of that. Think of what our service men and women do not only in Afghanistan Iraq or Syria but also in less closely observed places like Okinawa El Salvador or Yemen. The kinds of things our service men and women do following orders from men like Kelly are not particularly appreciated in the countries they destroy. Local elites may appreciate our torturing or assassinating their political enemies but only the most inhumane among them can really appreciate the war crimes that devastate their home countries.imagines a military full of starry-eyed heroes doing wonderful things and expects the rest of us to believe that too. The reality on the ground is thatwithin the military has reached record levels the military serves in part as a training ground forand other militants and the capacity of the American military to promote positive change anywhere in the world is pretty much nil.

It\u0027s unclear whether Nielsen is deciding to leave voluntarily or whether she has been pressured to resign.But Nielsen\u0027s tenure since she was confirmed in December 2017 has at times been rocky with the president taking some of his frustrations over illegal immigration out on her. Questions about whether she might leave have swirled for months. But she was by the president\u0027s side Friday in Calexico California as Mr. Trump pushed for a crackdown on illegal immigration and the need for a border wall.\""This afternoon I submitted my resignation to @POTUS and thanked him for the opportunity to serve in his administration.

Nielsen\u0027s departure also means acting heads will soon be running DHS the Pentagon and the U.S. Department of the Interior. Nielsen has also been one of only four women serving in Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration the others being Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao CIA Director Gina Haspel and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.One U.S. official told CBS News it is unlikely McAleenan would be nominated as Nielsen\u0027s permanent replacement. It\u0027s unclear whether he would have to resign as CBP commissioner to take the job and whether the line of succession at DHS would even allow for such a personnel move.

CBS News first reported Nielsen's impending departure which Mr. Trumpafter a 5 p.m. meeting with Nielsen at the White House.Nielsen spoke out for the first time since announcing her resignation outside her house Monday afternoon telling reporters there is a ""humanitarian crisis"" at the border and emphasizing the need to address that. Her resignation is effective Wednesday although Nielsen didn't leave her home in Virginia until early Monday afternoon.""I don't have any new announcements. I just want to thank the president again for the tremendous opportunity to serve this country. I'm forever grateful and proud of the men and women of DHS who work so hard every day to execute their missions and support the homeland"" she told reporters outside her home on Monday taking no questions.

Her departure is a part of a massive DHS overhaul engineered and directed by top Trump adviser Stephen Miller according to a senior U.S. official. It's unclear whether Nielsen is deciding to leave voluntarily or whether she has been pressured to resign.But Nielsen's tenure since she was confirmed in December 2017 has at times been rocky with the president taking some of his frustrations over illegal immigration out on her. Questions about whether she might leave have swirled for months. But she was by the president's side Friday in Calexico California as Mr. Trump pushed for a crackdown on illegal immigration and the need for a border wall.""This afternoon I submitted my resignation to @POTUS and thanked him for the opportunity to serve in his administration. It's been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov"" Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter which sheSunday evening.

Nielsen has also been one of only four women serving in Cabinet-level positions in the Trump administration the others being Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao CIA Director Gina Haspel and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.One U.S. official told CBS News it is unlikely McAleenan would be nominated as Nielsen's permanent replacement.

New reports are calling attention to the harms of prison violence - VoLog In or Sign UAmerica is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violencRecent reports show how overcrowding understaffing and limited resources are contributing to violence in prisons.America is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violencPelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City California. This week a Department of Justice report and an Ohio lawsuit called new attention to violent conditions in many US prisons.Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImageIn some US prisons inmates are subjected to violence and inhumane conditions on a daily basis. This week a new report and a lawsuit brought renewed attention to that fact.On Wednesday the Department of Justice released adamning report on prisons in Alabam showing that a combination of understaffing overcrowding and poor management led to the stateâs prison system having the highest number of homicides in the country. The conditions are so severe that they effectively deny Alabama inmates their constitutional rights to be protected from âcruel and unusual punishmentâ the report says.Voxâs German Lopez laid outsome of the reportâs detailThe problems the investigators said are tied to a severe lack of staffing and resources. There simply arenât enough guards in a system where major prisons are on average at 182 percent capacity and staffing levels can fall below 20 percent of authorized positions. And the prison infrastructure itself is often outdated and in deteriorating condition: Doors often canât lock making it impossible to control violent situations and investigators found open sewage running through prisons.The results are horrifying. As Katie Benner and Shaila Dewanreported for the New York Time âOne prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down his face was flattened. Another was tied up and tortured for two days while no one noticed. Bloody inmates screamed for help from cells whose doors did not lock.âAlabama prisons are plagued by âa high level of violence that is too common cruel of an unusual nature and pervasiveâ the Justice Department concluded. The department noted that it could sue the state in 49 days if it does not address the concerns in the report.While the report has called considerable attention to Alabama itâs far from the only state with systemic problems of this kind.Also on Wednesday two men previously incarcerated at the maximum-security Southern Ohio Correctional Facilityalleging that guards there failed to take action when they were repeatedly stabbed by another inmate in a bloody 2017 incident that was captured on video. The lawsuit which argues that the menâs constitutional rights were violated when the officers failed to protect them from violence in the prisonalso claims that guards failed to provide first aid for 10 minutes after the incident and that the men were beaten by guards on other occasions.Taken together the Alabama report and the Ohio case indicate thaviolence in some US prisons is a systemic issue â a fact that impacts thousands of people incarcerated at these facilities every day.The levels of violence in prisons arenât fully captured in data but itâs clear that thereâs a probleThereâs no single source tracking every incident of violence in Americaâs prisons but in recent years a number of studies and lawsuits have called attention to the ways that understaffing poor conditions and overcrowding have collided to create unsafe and at times violent environments in a number of these facilities.Sometimes these problems come to light because of individual incidents like thethat took place in South Carolinaâs Lee Correctional Institution. In that incident the AP noted that disputes over territory and money led to a bloody conflict that ended with the deaths of seven inmates and the injury of 17 others.That riot called attention to a deeper problem in South Carolina prisons which have been subjected to a number of lawsuits. a South Carolina news outlet prisons are woefully understaffed and have limited â and in some cases nonexistent âmental health resources for inmates.The result is an environment where people turn to gangs for protection and survival fueling violent incidents.âThey [officials] obviously arenât providing the constitutionally required safe environment for the inmatesâ Carter Elliott a Georgetown lawyer whose has filed lawsuits for inmates in South Carolina told the news outlet last year.In other states inmates have turned tolike work and hunger strikes to call attention to the conditions they are forced to live in.As reports of prison violence in states likeshow dangerous conditions can often lead to severe outcomes for incarcerated people â including homicides assaults rape and drug overdoses â which remain a problem in many prisons and are not limited to any particular region.For example the Ohio lawsuit mentioned above references an when an inmate in a Louisville prison Greg Reinke used a homemade knife to stab four men multiple times. The men were unable to flee because they were shackled to a table. One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit Shamieke Pugh was stabbed a dozen times.The AP notes that the lawsuit against âthe warden two officers and other staff members alleges violations of constitutional rights including deliberate indifference to potential harm and different treatment of the attacker who is white compared with the other inmates who are black.âReinke brutally attacked a prison guard months later and eventually received anin prison on top of the life sentence he was already serving.âI hope no other inmates ever have to fight for their lives the way I had toâ Pugh saidduring a Wednesday news conferenc adding that he believes the facilityâs guards were responsible for the incident. âI did a crime and I did my time. But the guards got away scot-free after almost killing me. That ainât right.âThe facility has denied that its guards acted inappropriately or failed to respond to the 2017 attack.The issues highlighted in Alabama and Ohio this week of course are part of a broader issue in prisons. But while there are plenty of stories highlighting just how severe the problem is in many states policymakers have not always centered prison reform in broader criminal justice measures. Instead high-profile efforts to address prison conditions have often centered on specific issues like ending the use of solitary confinement or prohibiting the shackling of pregnant women.Some of this has to do with the ways many people think of prisons. Asa recent New York Times article on Alabamaâs notorious St. Clair Correctional Facility note national discussion of prisons still often centers around the idea that âwhatever treatment prisoners get they surely must deserve.â One of the barriers to adequately addressing prison violence is the belief that violence is normal or expected.But in the face of increased scrutiny and persistent action from prison reform advocates some states like Alabama are finding themselves under intense pressure to change. In February Republican Gov. Kay Iveyintroduced a plan to create new prisonin Alabama with improved health care capabilities education and treatment programs and mental health services. The state says that it was working on reforms before the Justice Department report was released.While the problems highlighted in Alabama are severe it is not the only state with these issues. And as evidence of dangerous environments in US prisons continues to emerge it is likely that more and more local and state governments will be confronted with demands for reform.Rep.

2020 election: Joe Biden responds to allegations of touching - VoLog In or Sign UBiden responds to allegations of touching: Iâll respect peopleâs âpersonal spaceâThe former vice president says his past behavior has been about âconnectingâ with people.Biden responds to allegations of touching: Iâll respect peopleâs âpersonal spaceâFormer US Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the University of Pennsylvaniaâs Irvine Auditorium February 19 2019 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.Former Vice President Joe Bideâ who is expected to announce a 2020 presidential bid soon â says heâs ready to respect peopleâs âpersonal spaceâ after new attention came toallegations he had acted inappropriately with womeâI shake hands I hug people I grab men and women by the shoulders and say âYou can do this.â Whether they are women men young old itâs the way Iâve always been. Itâs the way I show I care about them that I listenâ he said. âSocial norms have begun to change theyâve shifted. And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what theyâre saying I understand it. And Iâll be much more mindful. Thatâs my responsibility and Iâll meet it.âBiden offered no direct apology for his past actions but said he would be mindful of changing norms around physical contact.Social norms are changing. I understand that and Iâve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. Thatâs my responsibility and I will meet it.Bidenâs statement seemed to suggest that he intended to adjust the way he behaved moving forward but did very little to acknowledge any specific experiences of the women who have come forward.In an essay published inNew York magazineâs The Cut last wee former Nevada lawmaker Lucy Flores said Biden had come up behind her smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head making her feel uncomfortable in the process. Former congressional staffer Amy Lappos toldthat Biden had rubbed her nose with his nose at a fundraiser. On Tuesday two additional womentold the New York Timethat he had touched them in way that made them âuncomfortableâ: College student Caitlyn Caruso said he had put his hand on her thigh while D.J. Hill said he had moved his hand from her shoulder to her back.Biden addressed the allegations in very broad strokes.He noted that there were âgestures of support and encouragement that Iâve made to women and some men and Iâve made them uncomfortableâ but chalked up the behavior to his desire to connect with people while governing.âIâve never thought of politics as cold and antiseptic. Iâve always thought about it as connecting with people. Shaking hands hands on the shoulder a hug. Encouragementâ he said.Biden also suggested that his career working on policy to advance gender equity â including the Violence Against Women Act â served as a testament to how committed he was to changing his behavior.âIâve worked my whole life to empower women my whole life to prevent abuse. The idea that I canât adjust to the fact that personal space is important ... is just not thinkable.âRep.

The Big Obstacle for Bernie Isnât DNC âRiggingâ -- Itâs Media Trashing | Freepress.orThe Big Obstacle for Bernie Isnât DNC âRiggingâ -- Itâs Media TrashinSome people are attached to the idea that the Democratic National Committee will ârigâ the presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders. The meme encourages the belief that the Bernie 2020 campaign is futile because of powerful corporate Democrats. But such fatalism should be discarded.As Frederick Douglass said âPower concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.â Of course top Democratic Party officials donât intend to give up control. It has to be taken from them. And the conditions for doing that are now more favorable than ever.The effects of mobilized demands for change in the Democratic presidential nominating process have been-- not out of the goodness of any power brokerâs heart but because progressives have organized effectively during the last two years.âI think I will not shock anybody to suggest that the DNC was not quite evenhandedâ during the 2016 race Bernielast week on CNN. âI think we have come a long way since then and I fully expect to be treated quite as well as anybody else.âOne big factor: This time no candidate can gain frontrunner leverage with superdelegates the way Hillary Clinton did early in the race. Last August undersuperdelegatesâ votes at the Democratic National Convention for the first ballot of the nominating process. There hasnât been a second ballot since 1952.When timeworn polemics insist that whatâs now underway canât really happen it is time to revise the polemics. For many years we heard that genuinely progressive Democrats couldnât make meaningful inroads in Congress. Now with impacts that far exceed their growing numbers recently arrived House members are doing a lot to help reshape the political discourse -- notably Pramila Jayapal Ro Khanna Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ilhan Omar Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.While ill-founded the line that âthe DNC will rig 2020â is apt to have perverse impacts. No doubt sincerely believed by some the outdated notion serves to demoralize and de-energize.Is the Bernie 2020 campaign facing a steep uphill climb? Of course it is. Are powerful forces arrayed to crush it? Absolutely.But letâs be clear. The huge obstacle ahead is not the DNC -- itâs the mass media. The corporate-owned and corporate-advertiser-funded media of this country are the biggest barriers between Bernie Sanders and the Oval Office.Often functioning as propaganda outlets the major news media serve as an amplification system for corporate power that hasthe Democratic Party from the combined âthreatsâ ofand progressive populist candidates. The synergies of momentum from the left -- outside and inside of electoral arenas -- are continuing to accelerate.Itâs crucial that progressives develop more effective challenges to the media serving the predatory big-money system. More than any other forcereflexive spin from corporate medistands between us and a Bernie Sanders presidency.In sharp contrast to campaigns with enormous budgets for Astroturf the first Sanders presidential campaign was able to effectively defy the conventional wisdom and overall power structure by inspiring and mobilizing at the grassroots. His campaign was -- and is -- antithetical to the politics of corporate media.Two examples of news coverage exactly three years apart indicate what the Bernie 2020 campaign will be up against.Â In early March 2016 at a pivotal moment during the primary campaign FAIR analyst Adam Johnsonâran 16 negative stories on Bernie Sanders in 16 hours . . . a window that includes the crucial Democratic debate in Flint Michigan and the next morningâs spin.âDays ago when Bernie Sanders launched his campaign with a big rally in Brooklyn the MSNBC coverage was so slanted that anfrom Glenn Greenwald appeared under the headline âMSNBC Yet Again Broadcasts Blatant Lies This Time About Bernie Sandersâ Opening Speech and Refuses to Correct Them.âGreenwaldâs critique of MSNBC focused on flagrantly inaccurate anti-Sanders commentary from a former Hillary Clinton aide that immediately followed the senatorâs Brooklyn speech. No Sanders supporter was included in the discussion. The coverage prompted an email from FAIR founder (and my colleague) Jeff Cohen to an MSNBC vice president: âYou have no trouble finding hardcore Clintonite Bernie-bashers; please offer some balance in your analysts. In todayâs Democratic Party thereâs clearly more sympathy for Bernie than the Clintons -- but not on MSNBC.âItâs worth noting that this owned by the worldâs richest person Jeff Bezos while MSNBC is owned byComcast âthe worldâs largest entertainment company.âTo counteract the media propaganda arsenal now in place we should fully recognize that arsenal as the main weaponry that corporate power will deploy against the Bernie 2020 campaign. We must confront those corporate media forces while vastly strengthening independent progressive media work of all kinds.,1

Trump tax returns: Lawyer calls Democratsâ demands âa gross abuse of powerâ - VoLog In or Sign UTrumpâs lawyer calls Democratsâ demands for tax returns âa gross abuse of powerâItâs the beginning of what may become a drawn out legal battle.Trumpâs lawyer calls Democratsâ demands for tax returns âa gross abuse of powerâPhoto by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImageFor more than four years President Donald Trump has refused to release his federal income tax returns. Friday his attorney said the president plans to continue doing so despite pressure from House Democrats to make the returns public.In a letter to the Treasury Department Trumpâs attorney William Consovoy called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reject a request from the House Ways and Means Committee to release the presidentâs personal and business tax returns.âIt would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack harass and intimidate their political opponentsâ. âOnce this Pandoraâs box is opened the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.âRep. Richard Neal (D-MA) who chairs the House Ways and Means Committeedemanded Trumpâs returns on Wednesda following months of astart to a number of investigations into the Trump White House by Democrats newly in control of the House of Representatives.Neal wants six years worth of Trumpâpersonal federal income tax returns and returns for business entities tied to his name spanning 2013 through 2018. The chairman set an April 10 deadline for returnsâ release.The presidentâs legal team made clear this week that it has every intention to fight House Democrats tooth and nail over the issue. The team has already indicated a willingness to bring the issue all the way to the Supreme Court.Trumpâs argument for why he shouldnât release his returns keeps changinTrump defied decades of precedent in refusing to release his returns â every modern presidential party nominee has made their tax returns public at one point or another. The president has justified his refusal to follow suit but his justifications keep changing.Over the course of his 2016 presidential campaign Trump waffled over whether heâd actually make his returns available to the public. Before formally announcing his campaign Trump promisedconservative radio host Hugh Hewithe would release his returns should he run for president. The president then punted on the issue after he formally declared his candidacy months later saying in August 2015 that heâd release them âTrump teased of a big tax return reveal during the Republican primary season. But as Trumpâs storyline started to shift around the time he edged closer to clinching the partyâs nomination. Trump began arguing that he was barred from releasing his returns because he was being audited by the IRS. Only after the audit was finished would he be able to make the returns public he claimed.Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) debunked these claims as bogus. Nevertheless itâs a justification Trump continues to use today. âUntil such time as I am not under audit I will not be doing that thank youâ Trump said this week according toHouse Democrats are now trying to use the audit process against the president. Theyâre using a somewhat novel approach working to obtain Trumpâs returns by checking on whether the IRS is properly auditing his taxes.In a letter to the IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Wednesday Neal wrote that although the agency has historically audited the tax returns of sitting presidents and vice presidents little is known about the process. The chairman argued the House needed the returns in order to fulfill Congressâ duty in conducting âoversight of departments and officials.âTrumpâs legal team responded by calling on the Justice Department to weigh in; it also asked the Treasury Department to deny Nealâs request until the DOJ submits a formal legal opinion.As New York Times reporter Maggie Habermapoints out central to the attorneysâ argument is a claim that Trump is both a regular citizen and sitting president. On one hand they argue he is a private citizen and that Nealâs committee has âno power to conduct its own examination of the individual taxpayers.â On the other hand Trump has used his authority as president to fill federal agencies with political appointees including Rettig.As Voxâs Emily Stewart reports before he led the IRS Rettig said he wouldnât advise Trump to release his returnsâWould any experienced tax lawyer representing Trump in an IRS audit advise him to publicly release his tax returns during the audit? Absolutely notâ Rettig said in 2016.Trump lawyers have consistently elevated the concept of his rights as a private citizen when critics have raised questions about aspects of his conduct in office. Most extreme example of him trying to be two things at once.The almost certain impending legal battle over the presidentâs tax returns will likely stretch out for months meaning there is a high chance thateven if Democrats do get their hands on the it wonât be until after the 2020 presidential election.Trump has been able to stall on releasing his returns for this long â odds are even with House Democrats turning up the pressure this wonât be his last stand.Rep.

Socialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Womenâs Day | ColumbusFreePress.coSocialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Womenâs Dacoalition and allies from Columbus decided to send Ohio Governor Mike DeWine a message for International Womenâs Day. A dozen women and men attempted to access DeWineâs upper-floor office at the Columbus Riffe Center.After being turned away they went to the ground floor lobby and held a. âOur bodies our choice!â they chanted. âGovernor DeWine abortionâs not a crime!âThe protesters were targeting Ohio Senate Bill 23 the so-called âheartbeat billâ which would ban abortions six weeks after conception. DeWine has pledged to sign the bill if itâs passed by the Ohio legislature.When the lobby closed at 5 PM State Highway Patrol officers ordered the demonstrators to leave. Depending on their level of resistance they were escorted dragged or carried out of the building. There were no arrests. Outside the protesters were joined by about 40 supporters and held a rally on the sidewalk.âIn Kentucky a very similar bill is poised to become law very shortlyâ said Ashley Theissen a member of the International Socialist Organization. âOhio SB 23 is still in committee. We have a lot of time to build a movement to stop it in its tracks.âTheissen doesnât believe the abortion fight can be won at the ballot box. âFor many years now the mainstream feminist groups have decided to take a tactic of electoral politics: donating to Democrats and hoping that things work out all rightâ she said. âWe know by the state of Kentucky and now Ohio that this has not been an effective strategy.âSocialist feminists in Cincinnati want to build a coalition across Ohio to fight back against SB 23 Theissen said. âThe only way that we can protect abortion access is to build a mass movement. Itâs not going to be settled by getting a few more people in office who might be a little more sympathetic to our rights. When we Roe v. Wade was won Nixon was sitting in the White House and four Nixon appointees were sitting on the Supreme Court. Three of the four went with the majority decision. They voted for Roe v. Wade. The reason why is that a massive movement from below had forced their hand. They had no choice but to make abortion legal.ââFuck the courts and legislature. Women are not incubators!â the crowd chanted.âThe clear intention of the Ohio legislature is to pass a law that forces a Supreme Court case with the potential of overthrowing Roe v. Wadeâ said Socialist Alternative member Amanda Ponomarenko. Â The 1973 ruling âhas been the target of the religious right in this country for decades. Theyâve been organizing with Republicans for years to pass laws restricting access to abortion. Theyâre emboldened by Trumpâs presidency and celebrating his two Supreme Court appointments Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh who pose a real threat to Roe v. Wade and womenâs reproductive health.âPonomarenko linked reproductive rights to a broader social transformation. âWe need to continue to bring #MeToo into the workplace in the struggle against harassment to demand the right to reproductive health care â including abortion â and universal child care. We need an end to for-profit health care and a Medicare for all system. We can fight for a federal $15 an hour minimum wage and affordable housing â the bare minimum necessities for working class familiesâ she said.âFor this change to last weâll need to transform these struggles for reform into a fight for a radical shift in society â to a society based on human need and not on profit.âBob Bites Back: The Columbus Way wonât worBreaking down the Columbus bond issues for the May 7th primary electioDeWineâs State of State Rhetoric Doesnât Align with Ohioâs RecordSix week abortion ban passes SenatProtesters call for mass movement to #CancelKavanaugYoung feminists celebrate the revolutionary roots of International Womenâs Da,1

"Trump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one day - VoLog In or Sign UTrump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one daTrump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one daTrump leaves the White House on Friday.President Donald Trump made two remarkably authoritarian comments on Friday first urging Congress to âget rid of judgesâ â specifically immigration judges â and later demeaning the entire media as the âENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!âBut in a sign of how normalized the behavior of this president has become neither remark amounted to much more than a blip on the news radar.Trump made his comment about immigration judges during a question-and-answer session with reporters before departing the White House for a photo opportunity along the southern border in California.âCongress has to actâ Trump said. âThey have to get rid of catch and release chain migration visa lottery they have to get rid of the whole asylum system because it doesnât work and frankly we should get rid of judges. You canât have a court case every time somebody steps foot on our ground.âTrump calls on Congress to ""get rid of the whole asylum system"" because ""it doesn't work.""""Frankly we should get rid of judges"" he adds.the second time this week he has urged Congress âto get rid of judgesââ a proposal that thankfully for those of us who value checks and balances has little chance of gaining traction now that Democrats control the House.The president however is not even trying to hide the fact heâd like to have the power to summarily deport migrants and asylum seekers and has already demonstrateda willingness to try and seize emergency powerLater while Air Force One was on its way to California Trump posted a tweet in which he characterized the entire âpressâ as âtruly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!âThe press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They canât stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!â Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Trumpâs tweet represented an escalation of his anti-press rhetoric. In the past Trump had been careful to qualify his âenemy of the peopleâ attacks as applying to âTHE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIâ or only pertaining to âWhite House officials cited Trumpâs hedging in his defense. Aftera Trump fan sent package bombto a number of prominent Trump critics in the media and politics last fall Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended Trumpâs âenemy of the peopleâ tweets by âthe presidentâs not referencing all media. Heâs talking about the growing amount of fake news in the country. The presidentâs calling that out.âBut last month Trump went a step further and called ââ âthe Enemy of the People.â Now heâs using that attack against the entire press.The president says a lot of ugly stuff and much of it can safely be tuned out. Still Trumpâs comments on Friday highlight how unprecedented the current state of affairs is for our country. The president aspires to being an authoritarian ruler and isnât really trying to hide it.Regardless of whether you take Trumpâs comments literally or merely seriously they are disturbing.

Under IRS code 6103 only the Joint Committee on Taxation the House Ways and Means chairman and the Senate Finance Committee chairman have the authority to request the tax information of an individual.But in a detailed letter to the general counsel of the Treasury Department on Friday Consovoy said that ""the committee's authority is subject to important constraints"" which he said citing the tax code ""extend to the ordinary taxpayer and the President alike.""Consovoy said that Neal does not have a ""legitimate committee purpose"" for obtaining the tax returns adding that Neal's request ""is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech.""Republicans warn Trump tax request 'sets a dangerous standard' and accuse Dems of weaponizing IRSTrump's attorneys have been preparing for several months to beat back an anticipated request for the President's tax returns a source close to Trump's legal team tells CNN.""We've been looking at this issue for several months"" the source said.""it's not just a tax issue"" the source added. ""In fact it's really not a tax issue it's really a statutory and constitutional issue.""After Democrats won the House it became clear that they would try and use the little known provision of the tax code to request Trump's tax returns from the IRS. Trump's attorneys wanted to be ready to go for when Neal decided to pull the trigger on his request.The President and his legal team decided to entrust the case to Consovoy and his firm in part because he had already been representing the President in the emoluments case.""This is not a new team member"" the source points out.The Democrats' request was also rebuked by congressional Republicans with House Republican Leader Kevinthat it ""sets a dangerous standard of having the federal government used as a political weapon"" and dismissing the move as ""a waste of time.""Trump himself sidestepped a question Thursday afternoon over whether he will tell the commissioner of the IRS to not comply with the congressional request for his tax returns.""They'll speak to my lawyers and they'll speak to the attorney general"" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office.And on Friday when asked if he was confident he would be able to keep the Democrats from obtaining his taxes Trump told reporters: ""Oh I don't know. That's up to whoever handles it. I don't know. Hey I'm under audit. But that's up to whoever it is. From what I understand the law is 100% on my side.""The IRS has yet to respond to the request which is likely to trigger months or even years of legal battles. The likely next step would be that the Treasury Department would get opinions on how to handle the matter which could involve the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.""We will see you in court"" the administration official said.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

A look back at 2017 | ColumbusFreePress.coA look back at 201Thank Mother Earth 2017 is finally over. It was a year that chewed me up crapped me out made sweet love to me punched me in the gut stole my lunch money made me laugh pantsed me and gave me hope. And Iâm only talking about American politics.It all began with saying goodbye to Barack Obama the biggest disappointment since losing your virginity. His departure was going to be the end of congressional gridlock and political baby steps. Special interests criminals and Valerie Jarrett would no longer decide the nationâs fate while the president negotiated speaking fees with Cantor Fitzgerald. The people would take back their government they would take back their lives. Yet as we know all too painfully the euphoria was immediately extinguished when Hurricane Donald made landfall.Weeks before he was even sworn in Donald Trump was completely ignoring the hominids who voted for him. He wasnât draining the swamp he was filling it with Burmese pythons and kudzu. An oil executive as Secretary of State. A phenomenally racist Attorney General. A filthy rich 80-year-old Commerce Secretary. A moronic Energy Secretary who forgot his own department even existed. It was a group of mostly white males who clearly had no regard for the poor or working families let alone women people of color or the environment. Since the inauguration and its dark and linguistically cringeworthy speech the new Republican government has shown an ever-deepening disregard for its supporters from 2016 and attacked nearly every demographic imaginable.Perhaps the worst thing âourâ government did was add Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Even without getting into Gorsuchâs specifics there are two big reasons why this is probably worse than any of the executive orders or legislation this year. The first is that it gave us many more years of Antonin Scalia and the second is how little the Constitution has ever really mattered in this country. The Supreme Courtâs rulings which have a much bigger impact than legislation are never based on what the Constitution says. They rely solely on the biased political opinions of the nine incumbents. If the words of the Constitution were all that mattered the confirmation process would be a dull formality and there would be a true separation between the judiciary and the other two branches of government. Also we would have gun control religion would not possess the stranglehold on public life it currently has and the death penalty would long since have been abolished. Having Gorsuch on the bench means his antiquated views on gender could dictate the actions of millions of women and his obsolete religious ideas are likely to hold America back in a 21st century dark age. Presidents come and go legislation expires and news stories disappear when they are no longer profitable but the 50-year-old Neil Gorsuch will likely be around for a very long time; even longer than the children women wonât be allowed to abort.The Republicans followed that all-too-easy success with a spectacular failure. Their attempted dismantling of Obamacare gave many hope that their intellectual ineptitude political in-fighting and prostate problems would keep them from following through on any of their devastating proposals. The first problem was whether to just repeal or also replace Obamaâs crowning achievement. They were caught between creating a known yet unspecified mess and a shambles of their own design. Already looking ahead to the midterms and 2020 they decided to be proactive and went for the nationâs jugular. Their bill stole billions of dollars from Medicaid which would have taken away healthcare from millions of Americans. It deregulated certain sections of the insurance industry thus increasing shareholder profits while dropping millions more from coverage and raising costs for everyone âfortunateâ enough to be able to afford private insurance. Thankfully it was too conservative for moderate Republicans and far too liberal for the lunatics who now run the party. Adding all that to the Democratsâ determination to preserve Barryâs legacy and portray themselves as the Rebel Alliance the bill was never going to pass. The Republicans canceled the vote and a still less-than-acceptable fraction of the American people kept their existing coverage.The embarrassment from aborting a vote on their own bill was clearly too much for the Republicans. They had to get their swagger back. They had to get back to âwinning â¦ winning like never before.â So they made the calm reasonable decision to move towards a nuclear war with North Korea. It was a wag the dog moment similar to Bill Clinton bombing Muslims to distract the country from the fact a woman other than his wife was playing his saxophone. The administration started by bemoaning the lack of effectiveness of international sanctions. That was a legitimate move because North Korea has long been in self-imposed isolation and the economic superpower of China will always be an ally. However Trump then created a huge breach of etiquette by skipping bilateral negotiations and going right to threats of military action. The ways in which that was foolish are almost innumerable. Nothing causes a country to ramp up its weapons production like threatening to bomb or invade it. There is no guarantee that missile strikes would either destroy North Koreaâs nuclear capabilities or cause enough civilian damage to force it to surrender. Military action would force at least China South Korea and Japan to get involved and disrupt some of the worldâs largest populations and economies. Now remember all of that was because a dirt-poor socialist nation tested a few impotent rockets. America was never and still is not in any real threat of a nuclear attack. Even if it were it has systems in place to ensure a launched missile never reaches American soil. The people of this country need to realize that threats to their safety do not come from foreign sources; they come from their own elected leaders. Not much has been said about the whole ordeal in recent weeks so hopefully Trump and Kim Jong-un have found better things to focus on and learned to be happy with their girths and lengths.One area in which the Republican government did something concrete was tax reform. They wrote a sweeping bill in the shadows and kept it locked there until they were ready to vote on it. The secrecy was because they knew the Democrats would never vote for it and there would have been a huge backlash from liberal and progressive voters. We now have a good idea of what to expect once the bill goes into effect. Generally the richest Americans will get to keep more of other peopleâs hard-earned money and the rest will see life become even more financially burdensome. Specifically the corporate tax rate has been cut nearly in half which means larger shareholder dividends and another increase in the rapidly growing wealth gap. It also means billions less in tax revenues which will justify the governmentâs attacks on Medicaid and public education. The state and local tax deduction is gone so those living in states with an income and/or sales tax will pay more but see no benefit from additional government spending. The increased child tax credit doesnât extend to the lowest-earning families. Those Americans will not receive an extra penny to help with feeding clothing or educating their children. The individual mandate included in Obamacare has been repealed but is a double-edged sword. It eliminates the fine for not having private insurance which was a despicable act by our leaders to help increase their donorsâ profits or raise money from those who can ill afford to lose more. The problem with the repeal is that many Americans will drop their coverage and raise the cost of insurance for those who cannot live without it. The bill is so extremely petty that even a deduction for bicycle commuters (in an attempt to combat climate change) has been removed. It cannot be worth much in dollars to the government so it was nothing more than a middle finger to those who understand man-made climate change and do not believe an old man in the clouds is deliberately poisoning and suffocating us. The entire bill is what the year was always building towards: robber barons getting even richer at the expense of the most vulnerable sections of society. Poor people getting poorer public education becoming less accessible the environment turning more toxic and healthcare being a privilege.One thing you may have noticed about this brief summary of 2017 is that the Democrats barely showed up. Thatâs because they barely showed up in 2017. They offered scant resistance to the far-right forces taking over the country and they made no moves towards progressivism and away from the neoliberal nonsense that lost them the 2016 election. They let Trump have his cabinet of Voldemortâs disciples and failed to scream down his potentially dangerous rhetoric over North Korea. They havenât created any young open-minded leaders nor have they offered any fresh ideas for the future. The Democrats spent the year whining about Trump and Russia all of which has been wasted time. The Cold War ended nearly thirty years ago so making Russia the enemy of the state again is nothing short of silly. Even if Russia did sway the election there is very little that can be done about it. A few Trump campaign staffers may go to jail but there are no special elections for the presidency so if Trump is ultimately removed from office Mike Pence becomes president. If Pence also had contact with the Russians there are many more Republican troglodytes in line for Trumpâs gilded throne. Getting rid of Trump will not end the bigoted anti-science avaricious misogynistic poison weâve had to witness this year. Also unless America gets rid of its electronic voting machines and greatly curtails campaign contributions every election will be susceptible to outside influence and theft.Despite of all my bleak comments thus far there were some positives in 2017. Firstly watching wife-of-a-former-president Hillary Clinton be a front row spectator at Trumpâs inauguration brought a Paul Ryan-worthy smirk to my face. Obamaâs post-presidency travels and income have provided irrefutable evidence that he was and still is yet another money-obsessed tone deaf neoliberal elitist. Progressives can now say âI told you soâ and use their (hopefully mild and considerate) smugness to pull more people out to the true left. Bob Corker Joe Barton Pat Tiberi and Blake Farenthold among others will not be around in 2018 (although unfortunately still stealing oxygen). On a more serious note there really is plenty to be hopeful about moving forward. The womenâs march in January attracted approximately half a million people in Washington alone and has since been ranked as the largest single-day protest in history. The fight against neofascism and neoliberalism will never succeed without women being at the forefront. Thankfully that is exactly what is happening. The increase in women participating in public life is fueling an all-around increase in political awareness and activism. More and more Americans are educating themselves on their government and public policy which will lead to better-informed voting cutting-edge grassroots activism and a more diverse pool of candidates from which to choose. The progressive left has grown exponentially in both membership and ideas. 2018 could very well see one or more socialist organizations become electoral forces. The community bill of rights movement as well as the increase in community radio stations and local nonprofits could ignore electoral politics and achieve much of what the government refuses to. There is absolutely no reason to be hopeful about our government as it currently stands but there is still plenty to be excited about. There could very well be enough energized progressives across the country to give us the America we all want and deserve.May you all have a happy healthy successful and goddamn radical 2018!Can the Green New Deal save the planet?The Cleveland School of Cannabis opens Columbus locatioThe real reason why Charter School apologists bully Columbus City School,1
Best Government Money Can Buy | Freepress.orBest Government Money Can BuVery few Americans know who Sheldon Adelson is and fewer still appreciate that as Americaâs when he speaks the Republican Party listens. By virtue of his largesse he has been able to direct GOP policy in the Middle East in favor of Israel which might well be regarded as his true home while the United States exists more as a faithful friend that can be produced at intervals whenever Israel finds itself in need of a bit of cash or political cover.Adelsonâs recent successes in translating his political donations into policy favorable to Israel have included shifting the US Embassy to Jerusalem cutting aid to Palestinians ending the Iranian nuclear monitoring agreement and closing the Palestine Liberation Organizationâs diplomatic office in Washington. All those Trump Administration measures were reportedly worked out privately by Adelson speaking directly with the president.Adelsonâs activities in buying politicians reflect what he believes he reportedlythat âthereâs no such thing as a Palestinian.â Nor does his world view include much concern for the country that has sheltered him and made him wealthy. He served in the US Army in World War 2 and has said that he as he would rather have worn an Israeli army uniform. He also expressed his desire that his son might become an Israeli Army sniper.Adelson benefits from his exceptional access to the White House to the detriment of actual American interests. AÂ New York TimesÂ article âSheldon Adelson Sees a Lot to Like in Trumpâs Washingtoâ states that he âenjoys a direct line to the presidentâ and meets the president monthly âin private in-person meetings and phone conversations.â He has been delighted with the openly expressed threats emanating from the Administrationâs key foreign and national security policy spokesmen regarding Iran. He would like to see the United States go to war with the Iranians to destroy their government and bring about some kind of regime change and judging from recent developments he just might get what he seeks which could easily have catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond.Adelson is somewhat unhinged on the issue of Iran and hasdropping a nuclear bomb on a desert region of the country as a negotiating tactic to show âwe mean businessâ so Washington could then âimpose its demands [on Iran] from a position of strength.â If Iran continued to resist Adelson would to drop the next one on Tehran. If Tehran were to be nukedIranians would die which doesnât bother Adelson one bit. Such a development would in Adelsonâs opinion be good for Israel which is his primary concern.Adelsonâs power over policy makers is also evident in what the White House does not do. Israeli snipers have shot deadunarmed Arab demonstrators in Gaza without so much as a word of condemnation coming out of Washington. Indeed the Donald Trump Ambassador to Israel David Friedman has gone out of his way to defend the killings and also to support the expansion of the illegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank.to have had a hand in personnel changes in the White House. He has used his money and influence to advance the careers of United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while also arranging the removal of H.R. McMaster and Rex Tillerson for âbeing anti-Israeliâ and not sufficiently willing to go to war with Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis the only actual adult remaining in the room when foreign policy is discussed is believed to be the next target for removal.How does Adelson do it? Money talks. He is worth. His fortune came from casinos both in the US and in China which some might consider to be promotion of vice. To buy and maintain the Republican support for right wing Zionist policies he has donated what is for him pocket change $55 million so far this year in support of GOP candidates in the Midterm elections. In 2016 heto the Trump campaign and to other Republicans donating $35 million to the former and $55 million to two top Republican PACs â the Congressional Leadership Fund and the Senate Leadership Fund.In Americaâs corrupt political culture a monster like Sheldon Adelson can buy both a White House and Congress on behalf of a foreign government for a paltry $150 million or so. It is a reasonable investment for him given his views as through him Israel is able to control a large slice of American foreign policy while also receiving billions of dollars each year from the US Treasury. And for those who think it would be different if the Democrats were in charge think again. The Democrats have their own Adelson. His name is Haim Saban an Israeli-American media magnate whohe is a âone issue guy and my issue is Israel.â He is also the largest individual contributor to the Democratic Party.,1

window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');Trump tells immigrants seeking asylum that 'our country is full'Trump tells immigrants seeking asylum: 'Our country is full'Donald Trump had a unwelcoming message to those seeking political asylum in the United States: Donât bother.âOur country is fullâ Trump said at an event in Calexico Calif. to promote construction of a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. âOur area is full. The sector is full. Canât take you anymore Iâm sorry. Canât happen. So turn around thatâs the way it is.âTrump described his remarks as âour new statementâ and said it applied to asylum seekers as well as immigrants crossing the border illegally.âIf you look at our southern border the number of people and the amount of drugs human trafficking â the human trafficking is something that nobody used to talk about I talk about it. Itâs a terrible thing. Itâs ancient and itâs never been bigger than it is modern right now today. All over the world by the way not just here. All over the world human trafficking a terrible thing.âAccording to figures provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials the number of people arrested for illegallyrose from 47986 in January to 66450 in February. Families many traveling from Central American countries made up more than half of those numbers CBP said.While arrests of criminal aliens have continued to fall the past two years Trump assured his audience that âthere is indeed an emergency on our southern border.ââItâs a colossal surgeâ Trump said of the migrant caravans from Central America âand itâs overwhelming our immigration system. We canât take you anymore.âSpecifically Trump singled out those seeking asylum saying that a large number of them were gang members.âItâs a scam. Itâs a hoaxâ Trump said. âI know about hoaxes. I just went through a hoaxâ which is how he refers to special counselof his campaignâs ties to the Russian government.At the same time Trump proclaimed that Mexico âhas been absolutely terrific for the last four daysâ arresting âthousandsâ of Central American migrants before they could reach the U.S. border. But then the president issued another warning.âIf for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the U.S. will be forced to tariff at 25 percent all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the border to us. If that doesnât work I will close the borderâ Trump vowed.Trump had backed off from that threat earlier in the week after lawmakers from both parties threw cold water on the idea.âClosing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing thatâ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned.Shutting down Americaâs southern border would threaten American jobs &amp; our broader economy while also running counter to our nationâs values.As for the country being âfullâ the United States with aof 35 people per square kilometer ranks 175th of 240 countries between Venezuela and Kyrgyzstan.Trumpâs rolling up the welcome mat for immigrants stands in opposition to the long-standing American tradition of welcoming immigrants summed up by the lines in Emma Lazarusâs poem âThe New Colossusâ inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty. âGive me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...âIn February Trump painted a very different picture regarding the countryâs need for new immigrants.âI need people coming in because we need people to run the factories and plants and companies that are moving back inâ Trump told reporters in February. âWe need people.âRead more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanLori Loughlin &amp; Felicity Huffman Might Go To Jail But That Doesn't Mean Their Careers Are OveAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say Itâs Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Compromise?

He issued a nationwide preliminary injunction that prevents the administration from forcing future asylum-seekers back into Mexico. The order goes into effect on Friday.Seeborg who was nominated by former President Barack ObamaÂ ruled that the Trump policy was not properly implemented and violated both U.S. laws and the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees which the U.S. is a party to. The asylum-seekers SeeborgÂ ruled were already fleeing dangerous conditions in their home countries only to be returned to Mexican border towns ""where they face undue risk to their lives and freedom.""The ruling marks the third straight time the Trump administration has been shot down in its attempts to limit or halt asylum-seekers who have been arriving at the U.S. border in record numbers.""Try as it may the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States"" saidÂ Judy Rabinovitz deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case.another federal judge struck dowthe Department of Justice's attempt to cut off asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. In Novemberanother federal judge struck dowJustice'sÂ attempts to cut off asylum for people who crossed into the country illegally which is allowed under U.S. law.In that case U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar wrote that Trump ""may not rewrite the immigration laws.""Families hoping to seek asylum in the United States wait on the bridge connecting Reynosa Mexico to Hidalgo Texas on March 15 2019.Central American migrants who were among the first to be returned to Tijuana after requesting asylum at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California and several humanitarian groups that have been assisting migrants.The policy officially called thebut informally referred to as the ""Remain in Mexico"" plan started in January at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California. The policyÂ has expanded to the Calexico Port of Entry about 120 miles east of San Ysidro and Homeland Security officials say the plan is to gradually roll it out to all other ports along the U.S.-Mexico border.It allows migrants from countries other than Mexico to request asylum at U.S ports of entry but then requires them to return to Mexico to wait for a decision. Previously asylum seekers were released into the U.S. and given a notice to appear in immigration court to proceed with their case.The U.S. and Mexican governments had been negotiating a joint plan where Mexico would assume responsibility of the waiting asylum applicants but when those talks broke down the Trump administrationit would unilaterally implement the policy forcing Mexico and collection of humanitarian groups to care for those migrants in Mexico.President Donald Trump tours border walA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.President Donald Trump speaks with members of the US Customs and Border Patrol as he tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico Calif. on April 5 2019.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Authorities arrested a woman on Friday who is accused of sending a threatening letter to Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine last year the Justice Department announced Monday.A criminal complaint against Suzanne Muscara dated Friday accused the Maine woman of violating a federal law against mailing threats by sending a letter last October to Collins shortly after her vote in favor of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.Court documents said Muscara's initial appearance was held in Bangor Maine on Monday afternoon and that Muscara was ""ordered temporarily detained"" with a preliminary hearing set for next week.Halsey Frank the US attorney for Maine announced Muscara's arrest and charging in a statement Monday morning and an attorney listed in the federal court system for Muscara did not immediately return a request for comment.The statement from Frank's office said if convicted Muscara ""faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250000 fine.""Collins' office confirmed the arrest on Monday. ""Senator Collins and Mr. (Tom) Daffron greatly appreciate the extraordinary efforts made by state and federal law enforcement agencies which culminated in an arrest in this case"" said Collins' spokeswoman Annie Clark.Daffron Collins' husband ""received a threatening letter that the writer claimed was contaminated with ricin"" aThe complaint against Muscara cited FBI agent Michel Verhar who said in an affidavit that an initial letter sent to Daffron said ""Good luck to you and Susan in the next life"" and that the letter claimed to be coated in ricin but that tests showed ""no hazardous materials were present.""Verhar said after the initial letter a postal inspector was assigned to screen all mail sent to Collins' residence and that inspector observed ""a fine white powder"" leaking from an envelope addressed to Collins. Tests showed the envelope tested negative for toxins according to Verhar and contained a flyer inside that read ""AnthRAX!!! HA HA HA!!!"" along with a stick figure ""with the letter 'X' for eyes the tongue sticking out and with 'You' and an arrow pointing at the stick figure face.""The FBI determined the white powder was starch and found a fingerprint that matched Muscara whose prints were in the FBI's database after a 2013 arrest in Pennsylvania according to Verhar.Verhar said he and another FBI agent approached Muscara last Friday who waived her Miranda rights and told them ""she had sent an envelope by mail to Senator Susan Collins that contained a white powder"" and recalled ""using the word 'anthrax.'""CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Klobuchar: Infrastructure is a 'bread and butter' issuKlobuchar: Infrastructure is a 'bread and butter' issuSen. Amy Klobuchar raised more than $5.2 million in the first seven weeks of her presidential bid the Minnesota Democrat's campaign announced Monday.Her fundraising haul appeared to edge her just past another senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Cory Booker who raised about $5 million. But Klobuchar now in her third Senate term ranks behind the early leaders in fundraising -- led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who collected $18.2 million during the first 41 days of his campaign and California Sen. Kamala Harris who raised $12 million in the first quarter.Klobuchar's fundraising also lagged behind that of former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke who entered the race more than a month after the Minnesotan and collected $9.4 million in just 18 days. He benefited from an enormous donor base built during his 2018 Senate bid. His strength as a small-dollar fundraiser helped him collect a record-smashing $80 million on his way to losing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Klobuchar coasted to re-election in Minnesota last fall and ended her Senate campaign with more than $3 million in leftover funds. Those reserves helped her start April with $7 million remaining in the bank.Two other Democratic contenders have announced how much money they have remaining in their bank accounts: Sanders with $28 million and Booker with $6.1 million.The fundraising totals offer an early snapshot of the financial strength of candidates in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump in the general election.Some of Klobuchar's fundraising has included higher-dollar events where she raised money for both the primary and general elections. Money raised for the general election would not be available to her until she received her party's nod. Her campaign's news release did not break out how much money specifically was raised for the primary.""Since that snowy day we launched in February the outpouring of support has been incredible"" Klobuchar said Monday on Twitter referring to her outdoor campaign announcement in the middle of a Minnesota snowstorm. She said her campaign had received donations from every state.With at least 17 contenders already declared and others waiting in the wings no Democratic candidate is posting record-breaking totals. Democrat Hillary Clinton for instance raised an eye-popping $47.5 million during her first quarter of the 2016 presidential race.Given the intense competition for the nomination in 2020 candidates' ability to draw in new small-dollar donors who can contribute repeatedly will be a key test of their staying power ahead of the Iowa caucuses which are nearly 10 months away.Klobuchar's aides said she attracted nearly 100000 online donors with an average online donation of $40. In addition 85% of all donors contributed less than $100 her campaign said.Klobuchar did not disclose how many people in total contributed to her campaign.In the news release her campaign aides said Klobuchar's bid would be ""homegrown"" and emphasized that she already has visited 10 states and met with ""thousands of voters"" in her fight for the nomination.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');Lawmakers from both parties ridicule Trump's 'idiotic' wind power theorieTrump just a blowhard on windmills lawmakers say of 'idiotic' commentPresident Trumpâs assertion at Tuesdayâs Republican Congressional Committeeâs annual dinner that the noise from wind power turbines ââ is being ridiculed by Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike.Sen. Chuck Grassley R-Iowa blasted the presidentâs claims in a Wednesday call with reporters.âIâm told that the White House respects my views on a lot of issuesâ Grassley said adding that Trumpâs âcomments on wind energy â not only as a president but when he was a candidate â were first of all idiotic and it didnât show much respect for Chuck Grassley as the grandfather of the wind energy tax credit.âDonald Trump and a wind farm. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP Getty Images)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Grassleyâs characterization.âThe president is saying that wind power is causing cancerâ Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. âI associate myself with the remarks of Chairman Grassley. Itâs an idiotic statement.âOn Wednesday Grassley joined a bipartisan group of 19 senators in signing a letter pushing âto ensure American remains a leader in wind energy technology.âThere is no scientific evidence to support Trumpâs claim that the noise from wind turbines is correlated with or causes cancer. Asked Wednesday whether Americans should be worried about such a risk White House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp was unable to explain the presidentâs remarks.âI donât have an answer to thatâ Schlapp replied.Connecting the noise from wind power turbines with cancer wasnât the only dubious claim the president made Tuesday about the alternative energy source.âIf you have a windmill anywhere near your house congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in valueâ Trump said.In February Trump lost a court case against the government of Scotland over the billionaireâs battle to halt construction of an 11-turbine wind farm offshore from his Aberdeen golf resort. The club must now reimburse the Scottish government for legal costs.Financial disclosure forms show however that while Trumpâs quixotic fight against the windmills will cost him millions in legal fees his golf propertyAt an October rally in Ohio Trump also claimed that a downside of wind power was that electrical service stops when the breeze dies.âWhen the wind doesnât blow just turn off the television darling please. Thereâs no wind. Please turn off the television quickly!â Trump said.Power generated by wind turbines generally is fed into a regional grid that receives energy from a variety of sources so that the lack of wind on a given day does not disrupt electricity.The depth of Trumpâs antipathy for wind power however may extend beyond the limits of reason. The man who proudly proclaims he âdigs coalâ has long railed against wind turbines including during White House meetings about renewable energy according to a report byâI hate the wind!â the president is said to have told senior administration officials.Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Kevin McAleenan has a good understanding of border operations: Former acting ICE DirectoOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes AddÂ to Supply ConcernAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburDozens of neglected animals evacuated from Gaza zoU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say Itâs Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Compromise?

(Photos: J. Scott Applewhite/AP AP)Pelosi also offered Biden some unsolicited advice saying he should respect peopleâs space by keeping them an armâs length away.âJoin the straight-arm clubâ she joked.Her comments come following accusations bytwo women who say Biden âinvadedâ their personal spacin separate incidents during his two terms as vice president. Lucy Flores a former Nevada state assemblywoman claims Biden approached her from behind and kissed the back of her head without her permission as they were waiting to take the stage at a political rally in Las Vegas in 2014.said she âfelt invadedâ and described the episode as âa violation of my personal spaceâbut that she does not consider it a sexual assault or harassment or that Biden had âa bad intention.âOn Monday Amy Lappos a former aide to Rep. Jim Himes D-Conn.she says she had with Biden in 2009. Lappos said Biden touched her inappropriately and rubbed noses with her at a political fundraiser in Greenwich Conn.âIt wasnât sexual but he did grab me by the headâ Amy Lappos told the Hartford Courant. âHe put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me. When he was pulling me in I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.âI never filed a complaint to be honest because he was the vice president. I was a nobodyâ she added. âThereâs absolutely a line of decency. Thereâs a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. Itâs not cultural. Itâs not affection. Itâs sexism or misogyny.âBiden and Pelosi hug during a White House event in 2010 celebrating the Affordable Care Act. (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images)saying he does not remember the alleged incident involving Flores but does not believe he ever acted inappropriately.âIn my many years on the campaign trail and in public life I have offered countless handshakes hugs expressions of affection support and comfort. And not once â never â did I believe I acted inappropriatelyâ the statement read. âIf it is suggested I did so I will listen respectfully.âBiden continued: âBut it was never my intention. I may not recall these moments the same way and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences and men should pay attention. And I will.âThe accusations come as the 76-year-old is considering another presidential run his third.Meanwhile several women have come to Bidenâs defense.Stephanie Carter the wife of former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter said that a viral photo showing Biden touching her during her husbandâs 2015 swearing-in ceremony â which resurfaced in the wake of Floresâs claims âhas been taken out of contexâLet me state upfront that I donât know [Flores] but I absolutely support her right to speak her truth and she should be like all women believedâStephanie Carter wrote in a Medium post Sunda. âBut her story is not mine.

Formed after the Islamic revolution in 1979 the IRGC is not only Iran's most powerful military institution it holds deep influence over domestic politics and the economy with interests extending to and beyond the construction telecommunications auto and energy industries.Beyond the internal dissent the designation triggered within the US government the move could also increase tensions with allies particularly where the IRGC has ties to militias and officials and Lebanon where it backs Hezbollah which is part of the government.Iran's Supreme National Security Council responded Monday by declaring the US a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and American troops operating in the region as ""terrorist groups"" according to IRNA Iran's state-run news agency.""The Islamic Republic of Iran declares itself in reciprocity against the unlawful and unreasonable action of the United States today considering the United States as a terrorist sponsored government and the Central Command of the United States CENTCOM and all its affiliated forces as terrorist groups"" the National Security Council of the Islamic Republic of Iran said in a statement IRNA reported.""Obviously the US regime will take all the responsibility for the dangerous consequences of this undertaking"" the statement said.The IRGC designation marks the first time that the United States has ever named a part of another government as a foreign terrorist organization.In an important step to counter the Iranian regime's terrorism the U.S. has designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps incl. Qods Force as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. We must help the people of Iran get back their freedom.It takes effect on April 15 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department Monday.Economic and travel sanctions on the elite military group mean any group or individual that does business with the IRGC could face criminal prosecution for providing material support to a terrorist organization.""This historic step will deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world"" Pompeo said. He warned that businesses with a presence in Iran or engaged with its companies will have to take extra steps to ensure they are not violating US sanctions.Brian Hook a senior policy adviser to Pompeo said Monday that the IRGC controls ""up to half Iran's economy.""""It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant amount of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy"" Pompeo said. ""Businesses and banks around the world now have a clear duty to ensure that companies with which they conduct transactions are not connected to the IRGC in any material way.""Senior officials said the designation decision formally under the State Department's purview represents the next step in the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign against Iran but the move had met with internal resistance because of concerns about American troops in the Middle East.Defense officials have told CNN that US troops in Syria and Iraq often find themselves operating in close proximity to members of the IRGC. The US has about 5000 troops in Iraq and close to 2000 in Syria.Last year CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats cautioned the administration that designating the IRGC could pose dangers to US forces according to one source familiar with the matter.Asked about the risks to US troops in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq Hook told reporters at the State Department that ""the decision leading up to this process was a full interagency process that included every member of the NSC. We have taken all measures that are appropriate and prudent in the context of this designation.""He added that ""whenever we and other nations call out and expose the regime for what it is it behaves like a mafia organization increasing its threats. We will not be deterred by their threats.""Nathan Sales the State Department's Coordinator for Counterterrorism said the agency would not discuss details of measures being taken to ensure the safety of US personnel.""I can assure you that we take force protection very very seriously. And that is why we have run a robust interagency process to make sure that all interested parties are prepared for whatever the Iranian regime might throw at us"" he said speaking alongside Hook Monday.Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich Pentagon spokeswoman said Monday that ""the Department of Defense is prepared to implement the President and Secretary of State's decision to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.""""As a matter of policy we do not discuss adjustments to force protection levels or measures for operational security reasons"" Rebarich continued. ""As always DoD has taken prudent measures to ensure the safety of our forces around the world and maintain our readiness to carry out our missions.""who have long agitated for FTO designation of the IRGC fully understand its consequences for US forces in the region. In fact they seek to drag US into a quagmire on his behalf.should know better than to be conned into another US disaster.Mark Dubowitz CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said it was ""fitting that the most dangerous terrorist group in the world responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents and backed by a massive state apparatus and vast energy wealth is being designated finally as a foreign terrorist organization.""The designation now means ""the US government can truly unleash its full economic prosecutorial and political powers"" to punish Iran Dubowitz said.Trita Parsi the author of ""Losing an Enemy - Obama Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy"" warned that the designation carries significant political implications and ultimately will not serve US security interests.""This move closes yet another potential door for peacefully resolving tensions with Iran"" Parsi said. ""Once all doors are closed and diplomacy is rendered impossible war will essentially become inevitable ... this decision does not in any way shape or form serve US national security. On the contrary it makes America less safe by making war more likely.""""Even if future administrations would want to resolve tensions with Iran the spiderweb of sanctions and terrorism designations makes any meaningful movement towards a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran politically unfeasible in Washington"" Parsi said.The move was warmly welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who thanked Trump in a tweet and appeared to take some credit for the move which comes a day before Israeli elections.""Thank you my dear friend President of the United States Donald Trump for your decision to declare Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a terror organization"" Netanyahu wrote. ""Thank you for responding to another one of my important requests that serves our interests and the interests of regional countries.""The IRGC designation follows Trump's March 21 announcement that the US would recognize Israeli control of the Golan Heights a step that counters United Nations resolutions against land being seized by force. Like the President's decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognize the city as Israel's capitol the Golan decision reversed decades of US policy and countered international norms.CNN's Ryan Browne Oren Liebermann Kylie Atwood Sara Mazloumsaki and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Background: Fred Trump. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP (3) Getty Images)Call him âPatient 1â: An individual in Washington D.C. who presents with symptoms of mental decline including a bizarre inability to remember where his own father was born. a psychiatrist on the faculty at the Yale School of Medicine has some insights to share which we will get to in a moment.On Tuesday at a meeting with the secretary-general of NATO President Trump launched into an impromptu riff on one of his favorite topics the reluctance of Americaâs wealthy European allies to pay more toward their own defense. Then in what might have been a clumsy effort to show no hard feelings heexpressed his love for German the ancestral home of the Trump (or originallyâMy father is German right? Was German. And born in a very wonderful place in Germany so I have a great feeling for Germany.âwas born in 1905 in the Bron approximately 4000 miles from Germany as the accompanying map shows. Trumpâs grandfather was born in Germany but was living in the United States with his wife when Frederick was born.Frederick Trump's birth certificate from the state of New York borough of the Bronx.Of all Trumpâs many misstatements exaggerations empty boasts and slips of the tongue this one â which Trump has made at least twice before â stands out for its sheer inexplicability. Ordinarily when Trump says something ridiculous itâs for an obvious purpose. He has been onan unhinged rant recently about windmillfunction in the electrical grid he misunderstandand whose sound he says causes cancer. That is an assertion for which the White House was unable to provide any support because he unquestionably made it up. But at least itâs consistent with his general disdain for environmentalism and explainable by his self-interest in fighting to stop an offshore wind farm that he believes will ruin the views from one of his golf resorts in Scotland. And it is strictly speaking unfalsifiable; the carcinogenic effect of windmill noise like a lot of other nonsensical beliefs hasnât been scientifically studied so all you can say is that thereâs no evidence for it.But thereâs a New York birth certificate that contradicts Trumpâs claim about his father and no obvious advantage for him to make up a story about it. To the contrary Trump early in his career disguised his German ancestryclaiming his family was actually from Swede a lie that apparently was intended to make it easier to do business in a city with the largest Jewish population in the world. And in his first memoir âThe Art of the Dealâ he wrote that his fatherâs âclassic Horatio Algerâ story began with his birth âin New Jersey in 1905.â The Bronx is only just across the Hudson River from New Jersey but it is in a whole different state. but one can imagine Freudian explanations for this peculiar assertion or at least I can. Mistakes Sigmund Freud theorized are often the key to hidden feelings and memories. Is it just a coincidence that Trump who got his start in national politics by peddling a conspiracy theory about his predecessorâs family and birthplace and who constantly measures himself against him repeatedly makes the same bizarre gaffe about where his own father was born? Is it resentment toward his overbearing father who made a fortune building apartment houses in the outer boroughs and reportedly never quite trusted his sonâs foray into glamorous Manhattan real estate? Someone I know who worked closely with Trump in the early 1990s when his casino empire was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy recalls him saying dolefully at the time âI should have listened to my father and stuck with Brooklyn. My father is going to say âI told you so.ââOf course Iâm no psychiatrist. But that holds the advantage that I am not bound by the American Psychiatric Associationâs ââ which forbids members to offer opinions at a distance on the mental health of public figures. The provision was added to the professionâs code of ethics after a number of psychiatrists publicly speculated on the fitness and stability of 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. He of course never became president but Trumpâs ascendance has prompted a number of prominent psychiatrists to declare an overriding emergency. Organized as theWorld Mental Health Coalition they held a conference in Washington last month on âThe Dangerous State of the World and the Need for Fit Leadership.ââWe are talking about the profound danger of the mentally unstable individual who holds the highest office in this country and most powerful single office in the entire worldâ said one of the speakers Jeffrey Sachs a Columbia University economist.âHe is rapidly decliningâ Lee the groupâs president said of Trump in an interview. âHis rallies have been increasingly less coherent with greater signs of paranoid responses increasing attraction to violence increasing espousal of conspiracy theories. A few weeks ago there was the â and the other day he referred to Venezuela as a company while recently he confused his fatherâs birthplace with his grandfatherâs.âHis mistakes are growing more and more bizarreâ Lee said. âIf we match the pattern of his deterioration against pathology what disease states look like we can say he is not well.âContinually we have been seeing that his erratic thoughts and behavior are more consistent with mental pathology than strategy. Now we are seeing a pattern of cognitive decline.âShortly after Trump took office Lee edited a book called âThe Dangerous Case of Donald Trumpâ a collection of essays by mental health professionals which recently appeared in a second edition. âWhat we said then was that he was worse than he appeared in public and would grow more dangerous over time. That his mental pathology would spread into his administration and the population.â She referenced a phenomenon called âshared psychosisâ in which delusions spread from one family member to his or her relatives.âIn terms of the presidencyâ she said âthe nation is the family. That is what weâre seeing now. One of the first things you lose is the ability to recognize that something is not right and to get help. An increasing proportion of the population is unable to recognize that something is not right. What you do in such a situation is contain the person remove them from access to weapons and do an urgent evaluation. Then you manage the person in the least restrictive manner according to the results of the evaluation.âLee said her organization was âin the process of forming an expert panel that can test fitness for dutyâ by presidential candidates pointing out that military officers in control of nuclear weapons undergo regular psychological evaluations. The exam she has in mind tests for such things as the ability to consider the consequences of decisions to follow a logical train of thought and to understand and explain back a story or scenario.I think that would be a good thing to do for Trump and for any of his would-be successors.But if I were administering the test Iâd start with one simple question:âDo you know where your father was born?âRead more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?A Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes AddÂ to Supply ConcernAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesProsecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock',1

And while Trump this week ruled out taking a vote on an Affordable Care Act alternative prior to the election amid Republican resistance to the prospect Mulvaney said the forthcoming plan would provide GOP candidates with campaign fodder.""Republicans have better ideas than Democrats. We should not be afraid to talk about that"" Mulvaney said on Fox News. ""We want to run on this.""Trump stunned Republicans late last month when he paired his administration's decision to back an Obamacare court challenge with a call for the GOP to develop a legislative replacement. White House allies lawmakers and even members of Trump's own staff werewhen the Justice Department filed a brief in court supporting the complete invalidation of the Affordable Care Act without preparing anything to take its place should that ruling stand.Unhappy with the President's decision to plunge the party back into a battle it lost less than two years ago Republicans said they would await guidance from the White House.

"Mueller report: What we know about the obstruction of justice case against Trump - VoLog In or Sign UWhat we know about Muellerâs case against Trump on obstruction of justicRecent leaks suggest tension between Attorney General Barr and members of Muellerâs team.What we know about Muellerâs case against Trump on obstruction of justicAttorney General William Barr departs the White House on February 15 2019.Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty ImageSerious tensions appear to be emerging between members of special counsel Robert Muellerâs team and Attorney General William Barr on obstruction of justice.Mueller team members have told associates their evidence against Trump on obstruction is âalarming and significantâ per the. Some of them feel Barrâs letter to Congress didnât properly describe âderogatory informationâthe report includes new material thatâs not publicly known.Yet Muellerâs report did not say whether or not Trumpâs conduct qualified as criminal and Barr then declared that per his review of the evidence it did not.But the recent leaks suggest Mueller team members think Barrâs assessment was too benign â and that thereâs more to the story.One possibility of whatâs going on is that Muellerâs team outlined an extensive pattern of troubling behavior from Trump that raised obstruction concerns but that Barr concluded there was no one incident that qualified as slam dunkâ obstruction of justice. And in fact since the obstruction debate began legal experts have disagreed on the strength of the publicly known evidence â some told Vox the casesaid it wasnât quite therThere could be other reasons for the disagreement; for instance Barr could be taking an extremely generous view of Trumpâs intent. We wonât know for sure until Muellerâs fuller report is released.But to understand the increasingly contentious debate over whether the president obstructed justice itâs worth reviewing what we already know Mueller investigated. From that itâs easy to see how some prosecutors may have concluded there was an extremely obvious pattern of obstruction of justice from Trump â while others may have thought there was no one example strong enough to justify a charge.1) Trumpâs interactions with James Comey regarding âloyaltyâ Michael Flynn and the Russia probIn the months before Trump fired James Comey the then-FBI director documented a series of interactions with the new president that he found troubling.On January 27 2017 Trump had Comey over for dinner at the White House. According to Trump asked for his âloyaltyâ and told him âI need loyalty.âOn February 14 2017 the day after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned Comey attended a briefing at the White House. When it was over Trump made clear he wanted everyone but Comey to leave. According to Trump said he wanted to âtalk about Mike Flynnâ and said âI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go.â Comey interpreted Trump to be referring to an FBI investigation into whether Flynn made false statements about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.On March 30 2017 Trump called Comey. According to Trump complained about the FBIâs Russia investigation calling it a cloud over his presidency asking what could be done to lift the cloud. Trump also inquired whether Comey could publicly state that Trump himself wasnât under investigation (which was to be fair something ComeyOn April 11 2017 Trump called Comey. According to Trump complained about the Russia investigation and the âcloudâ again and again asked whether Comey could publicly state that Trump wasnât personally under investigation.All of these seem to be efforts from Trump to get the FBI director to do his bidding. The most legally problematic of them may be Trumpâs request that Comey drop the Flynn investigation.have argued that this could be characterized in a more defensible way: as a recommendation of prosecutorial discretion from the head of the executive branch. Barr himselfin a memo he wrote last year before his appointment as attorney general. Yes recent norms dictate that a president shouldnât get involved in investigations but does that mean such a thing is illegal?2) Trumpâs decision to fire Comey and whether it was an attempt to obstruct the Russia probThe act that prompted Muellerâs appointment in the first place was Trumpâs decision to fire Comey.Although the White House claimed Comey was fired due to his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation questions immediately arose about whether Trumpâs true motivation was to try to obstruct the Russia investigation.The weekend before Trump fired Comey the president had White House senior adviser Stephen Miller draft a letter to Comey blasting the Russia probe as âfabricated and politically motivatedâper the New York Time. The letter was never sent.On May 8 2017 Trump called Sessions and Rosenstein to the White House to discuss firing Comey. Trump gave Rosenstein Millerâs letter and Rosenstein said he would write his own memo. âThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax when will this taxpayer funded charade end?âThe next day May 9 the White House announced Comeyâs firing. In doing soa memo from Rosenstein criticizing Comeyâs handling of the Clinton email case a letter from Sessions recommending Comeyâs removal. They also released a letter from Trump making public that Comey had told him âon three separate occasions that I am not under investigation.âOn May 10 2017 Trump had a private meeting with Russiaâs ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. âI just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy a real nut jobâ Trump said according to a document. âI faced great pressure because of Russia. Thatâs taken offâ he added.Trump told NBCâs Lester Holthat he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosensteinâs recommendation. âAnd in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said âYou know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up storyââ he said. The statement appeared to directly tie the Russia investigation to Comeyâs firing.The evidence seems clear that displeasure with the Russia investigation was at least part of Trumpâs motivation in firing Comey. The potential defense from the presidentâs team though is that this doesnât necessarily show Trump had corrupt intent aimed at covering up wrongdoing. Rather Trump could have fired Comey because he sincerely believed the Russia investigation was an unfair witch hunt. Beyond that Barrâs 2018 memothat the president has the power to fire the FBI director so that this canât be an obstructive action.3) Trumpâs pressures on Jeff Sessions and other officialBeyond just Comey Trumpâs contacts with Justice Department and intelligence officials regarding the Russia probe also came under scrutiny. For instance the special counselwanted to ask Trump many questionabout his treatment of Jeff Sessions.On March 1 2017 thethat Sessions had a meeting with the Russian ambassador that he didnât disclose during his Senate confirmation hearing. Public pressure on Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation ensued.Around this time Trump instructed White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing himself. But it didnât work â on March 2 2017 SessionsTwo days later Trump told Sessions that he should reverse his decision during a private conversation at Mar-a-Lago. (Sessions did not do so.)On May 17 2017 when Trump got the news that Mueller had been appointed as special counsel he called Sessions an âidiotâ and said he should resignSessions then submitted a resignation letter. Trumpheld onto it until May 31 2017but then returned it to Sessions â rejecting the resignation.But in late July 2017 Trump turned his attention to Sessions again. The president began mocking and berating his own attorney general in tweets and calling his recusal âthat Sessions wasnât looking into âHillary Clinton or Comey crimes.âAround the same time TrumpWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus to get him Sessionsâs resignation. Priebus apparently failed to do so and Trump ended up firing Priebus shortly afterward.The special counsel may have been probing whether Trump was trying to force Sessions out so he could appoint a replacement who would fire Mueller. Of course Trump eventually did fire Sessions â but much later and his replacement did not fire Mueller.Muellerâs team also interviewed Trumpâs top three intelligence officials about their interactions with him.In March 2017 after Comey confirmed that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaignâs Russia ties in congressional testimony Trump reached out to CIA Director Mike Pompeo Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and NSA Director Mike Rogers.for help supporting his public narrative of âno collusionâ with Russia. Trump also asked Coats to try to get Comey to stop investigating Flynn.Finally Mueller even investigated an attempt by Trump to fire ... Mueller himself.In June 2017 just weeks after Muellerâs appointment Trump told McGahn that he wanted Mueller firedaccording to the New York Time. However McGahn did not carry out the order.Again we have a pattern of behavior in which Trump expresses great displeasure about the Russia investigation to key officials and in which he seems to be trying to get officials to bend to his will. But do these complaints and occasional (aborted) actions rise to the level of criminal obstruction of justice?4) Trumpâs interactions with Russia probe witnesses and defendantMueller has also dug into Trumpâs interactions with potential Russia probe witnesses. Heâs explored whether Trump dangled pardons to keep associates loyal Trumpâs involvement in crafting false or misleading statements issued by key figures and Trumpâs attacks on hostile witnesses.In April 2017 two months after Michael Flynnâs ouster as national security adviser Flynn told associates that he had gotten âa message from the president to stay strongâaccording to a report by Michael IsikofAt some point in 2017 before Flynn and Paul Manafort had been charged by Mueller Trump lawyer John Dowd was in contact with lawyers for both men â and âbroached the ideaâ that they could be pardonedper the New York TimeOn July 8 2017 Trumpâs team strategized over how to respond to questions from the New York Times about a meeting Donald Trump Jr. had had with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in 2016. President Trump thena statement for his son to release â butwas highly misleading claiming the meeting was about Russian adoptions. In truth Don Jr. agreed to the meeting in hopes of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton said to be coming from the Russian government.The next morning White House communications director Hope Hicks had a call with the president and Mark Corallo a spokesperson for Trumpâs outside legal team. On the call Hicks said that Don Jr.âs emails revealing the true purpose of the Trump Tower meeting âwill never get outâ. (They got out two days later.)In August 2017 Trumpâs lawyer Michael Cohen sent a letter to congressional committees several multiple false statements about talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow that had taken place during the campaign. Cohenabout how Trumpâs legal team reviewed his testimony in advance and said he interpreted some statements by Trump as suggestions he should lie.Trump has also repeatedly attacked witnesses that could be hostile to him in the investigation such as James Comey and Comeyâs deputy Andrew McCabe. He has for instance demanded that the Justice DepartmentMuch depends on the facts here. Itâs not clear for instance why Trump telling Don Jr. to give a false public statement would necessarily be considered obstruction â lying to law enforcement officials is a crime but lying to the public isnât.We wonât know more until we see what Mueller found but the debate may not go away even theAs you can tell thereâs ... a lot of potential evidence here. But does it add up to criminal obstruction of justice? Barr evidently maintains that it didnât and Mueller didnât say one way or the other.This may reflect a divide among legal experts thatâs been evident for some time. Some have long viewed the public evidence against Trump as quite strong. âIf Trump exercises his power â even his lawful power â with a corrupt motive of interfering with an investigation thatâs obstructionâ Lisa Kern Griffin an expert on criminal law at Duke University told my colleague Zack Beauchamp. âThe attempt is sufficient and it seems to be a matter of public record already.â. Some pointed to the presidentâs unique role (as Barr did in his memo). Others maintained that Trumpâs known acts simply werenât as clear-cut examples of obstruction as say urging witnesses to lie under oath or destroying evidence. âThis is not yet the type of case weâd ordinarily see an [obstruction of justice] indictment come out ofâ Laurie Levenson a former prosecutor and law professor at Loyola University told me last year.Another potential clue in Barrâs letter is what he writes about the presidentâs intent. âCorrupt intentâ is one of the three requirements Barr says must be proven for an obstruction offense â and Barr says that in his view the failure to establish an underlying crime from Trump related to Russian interference suggests Trumpâs intent with the many above actions may not have been corrupt. Itâs not clear whether Mueller shares this assessment though recent reports suggest some on his team donât have such a rosy view.Thereâs much we still donât know about what Mueller found and how both he and Barr reached their respective conclusions. But with Barr saying he expects to release a redacted version of Muellerâs report by mid-April weâll know more soon enough â and the American people will get to make up their own minds about whether the president is an obstructive crook.Special counsel Robert Muellerâs Trump-Russia investigation: news and latest updateWhat we know about Muellerâs case against Trump on obstruction of justicSenate Republicans keep blocking a resolution to make the Mueller report publiRep.

Social Media Madness: The Russia Canard | Freepress.orSocial Media Madness: The Russia CanarFor several months weâve been hearing a crescendo of outcries that Russia used social media to sway the 2016 presidential election. The claim has now been debunked by an unlikely source -- one of the most Russiagate-frenzied big media outlets in the United States theFar away from the media echo chamber thenews story is headlined: âThereâs Still Little Evidence That Russiaâs 2016 Social Media Efforts Did Much of AnythinThe article focuses on âwhat we actually know about the Russian activity on Facebook and Twitter: It was often modest heavily dissociated from the campaign itself and minute in the context of election social media efforts.âIn fact the ballyhooed Facebook ads were notablytargeted to be seen in swing states the piece byjournalist Philip Bump reports. As for the much-hyped tweets they were smaller than miniscule in quantity compared to overall election-related tweets.But donât expect the fervent canard about Russian manipulation of social media to fade away anytime soon. At this point the Russiagate atmosphere has become so toxic -- with incessant propaganda credulity fear-laced conformity and partisan opportunism -- that basic logic often disintegrates.One of the weirdest aspects of claims that Russia undermined the election with social media has involved explaining away the fact that few of the ads and posts in question actually referred to Hillary Clinton Donald Trump or the election. Instead weâre told the wily Russians tried to help Trump by inflaming social divisions such as racial tensions. Itâs a rampant storyline (renderedby NBC News political director Chuck Todd) thatâs reminiscent of the common claim during the civil rights movement that âoutside agitatorsâ such as Russian-directed reds were inflaming and exploiting racial tensions in the South.From there itâs just a hop skip and jump to smearing Americans who dissent from U.S. orthodoxies as useful idiots who serve the interests of plotters in the Kremlin.Of course history is not exactly repeating itself but itâs rhyming an awful lot. There are real parallels between the McCarthy Era and todayâs anti-Russia fervor in the United States.Despite all the information and analysis that have strengthened progressive understanding in this country during the last few decades fixating on Russia as culpable for the election of Trump has been widely irresistible. Perhaps that fixation is less upsetting than deeper realization of just how rotten the U.S. corporate system of injustice has become -- and how the forces that brought us the horrors of the Trump presidency are distinctly homegrown.on the USA. The consequences include heightened U.S.-Russia tensions that absolutely mean heightened risks of nuclear war -- and worsening threats to democratic discourse at home.The conditioned reflex to label as somehow âpro-Putinâ any opinion that overlaps with a Kremlin outlook is becoming part of the muscle memory of much of the American body politic. Countless journalists pundits activists and politicians have fallen under the Russiagate spell. They include the liberal primetime lineup on MSNBC where -- as the media watchdog group FAIRlast month -- Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes routinely bypass stories of great importance in order âto lead with minutiae from the ongoing Russia investigation that has consumedÂ MSNBCâs coverage like no other news event since the beginning of the Trump presidency.âAcross most of the media landscape the meme that Russians attacked American democracy with social-media posts has been treated as self-evident.In a typical exercise of the conformity that afflicts the national press corps the Washington bureau chief forthis fall that the House intelligence committee needed more staff to investigate in his words âhowâ -- not whether -- âa foreign adversary attacked American democracy.â His piece breathlessly declared that âthe Trump-Russia scandalâ was âexpanding -- it now includes new revelations regarding Moscowâs use of social media in the United States to influence the 2016 campaign.âThat kind of stenography for powerful spin may snag cable TV appearances and lucrative book contracts but itâs a notable disservice to journalism and democracy.Meanwhile most Democrats on Capitol Hill are eager to engage in such rhetoric. So it was just another routine appearance when Senator Richard Blumenthal went on CNN a week before Christmas andâthere is increasing evidence that the Russians are continuing their attack on our democracy.â He said: âThe Russian attack on our elections in 2016 was endlessly ingenious and inventive using all kinds of social media all kinds of intermediaries sources of information for them.âTo put it mildly that sort of bombast gains vastly more airtime than discussing the urgent need for dÃ©tente between the worldâs two nuclear superpowers.On MSNBC Rachel Maddow has climbed with her ratings to great mass-media acclaim while advancing herselfof the Trump presidency as one of the most prominent and irresponsible Russia baiters in U.S. media. At this rate when Maddow retires -- if she and the rest of us are lucky enough to avoid a nuclear holocaust -- she can look back on a career thatinto an obsessive crusade against Russia that increased the chances of World War III.In the poisonous media environment that keeps boosting her fame and fortune itâs grotesquely fitting that Maddow ---- has devoted so much of her program to the illusory Russian assault on democracy via social media.Thatâs the way it goes in the propaganda-polluted land of Russiagate.,1

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Lobbyist Sam Patten provided ""substantial assistance"" to special counsel Robert Mueller and several other ongoing investigations federal prosecutors said Monday paving the way for him to potentially avoid jail time at his sentencing this week.The case has been full of intrigue from the beginning givento several prongs of Mueller's investigation. He founded a company with a suspected Russian operative steered foreign money to President Donald Trump's inauguration was closely tied to Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and advised the controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica.Prosecutors from the US attorney's office in Washington didn't recommend a sentence for Patten who first came under investigation by Mueller's team. Heto illegally lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party that favors closer relations with Russia.The prosecutors said Patten's cooperation was ""immediate"" and ""substantial."" They told the judge that Patten deserved leniency and formally requested a reduction in his sentence.""Patten has met with government investigators in person or by phone a total of nine separate times to answer numerous questions and explain various documents"" prosecutors wrote. ""In all of these sessions Patten has been honest and straightforward with government investigators.""But almost all of the details surrounding Patten's ""substantial"" assistance will remain secret for now. Both sides said they would submit additional filings under seal with that information.The court filings revealed that Patten provided evidence against Manafort and was prepared to testify against Manafort at trial. Prosecutors said Patten's experience as an overseas political constant made him a ""valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities.""For his part Patten asked for probation instead of prison. His lawyers said he never intended to cover up anything related to Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. When he pleaded guilty Patten admitted that he illegally funneled money from a Russia-friendly oligarch to Trump's inauguration fund and that he lied about it to a congressional committee.""His crimes were not motivated by greed or a desire to conceal relevant information from the American public or to aid or cover up any potential interference with the 2016 Presidential election"" they wrote. ""To the contrary Mr. Patten's decisions in this case stemmed primarily from a desire to accommodate his clients' requests and to present himself in the best possible light after unexpectedly finding himself a subject of the Russian interference investigation.""That $50000 donation was a tiny fraction of the $107 million raised by Trump's inaugural fund. But federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkthat committee for a slew of potential crimes including fraud money laundering and conspiracy. It's not clear if Patten helped with that investigation whichThe contribution was not part of a broad effort to inject foreign funds into Trump's inauguration his lawyers said. Patten didn't even like Trump and opposed him in 2016 they added.""Mr. Patten did not support the Trump campaign and while he may have known people who worked for the campaign at various times he had no personal connection to it"" his lawyers wrote. ""Indeed Mr. Patten not only openly opposed the Trump candidacy but even broke with his party when he voted for President Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election.""In his first public comments about his crimes Patten submitted aexpressing remorse and describing how his actions triggered a ""very dark"" period for him and his family.""In the eight months since I pleaded guilty before you and more than a year since this journey began for me I have changed"" Patten wrote in the two-page letter which was dated March 28. ""To an even more meaningful degree than the day the FBI came to my door I have surrendered. But in admission and surrender I have also come to know a certain peace.""Patten who said in court last year that he was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression has given up drinking and attended more than 150 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous since his guilty plea his lawyers said. They submitted 45 pages of letters asking for leniency from Patten's family friends his AA sponsor and even his childhood babysitter growing up in Maine.A sentencing hearing for Patten is scheduled for Friday. Overseeing the case is Judge Amy Berman Jackson who handled Manafort's case and several other Mueller prosecutions. Patten's sentencing waswhile he cooperated with investigators.This case is unique as Patten pleaded guilty to a crime that is rarely prosecuted by the Justice Department. Onlyhave been charged in the past 50 years with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act a federal law that was enacted shortly before World War II.The small number of comparable cases means Berman Jackson will have ""even broader discretion"" than usual when she decides Patten's fate on Friday prosecutors noted. The maximum potential sentence is five years in prison and a $250000 fine though a much less severe outcome seems likely in this case.Patten's foreign client was the Opposition Bloc a Ukrainian political party that favors close ties with Russia. The party was formed by allies of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych after he fled the country amid unrest in 2014. Patten and Manafort worked for some of the same clients and Manafort wasin prison for crimes relating to his own lobbying.CNN's Kara Scannell contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Trumpâs asylum judges comment briefly explained - VoLog In or Sign UTrump isnât getting rid of immigration judges â but his administration is still making it harder to seek asyluDonald Trump is not a reliable source on his administrationâs immigration policy.Trump isnât getting rid of immigration judges â but his administration is still making it harder to seek asyluPresident Donald Trump talks to reporters while welcoming NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the White House on April 2 2019.If you take Donald Trump at his word he wants to get rid of judges.But it is a bad idea to take Donald Trump at his word or to assume that just because Trump says he wants a thing that thing is going to happen.During a rambling press appearance Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Trump went on a brief rant about all the changes to immigration policy he wanted Congress to pass featuring some old favorites â like ending âchain migrationâ and the visa lottery â but including a new spin on Trumpâs attacks on asylum seekers:And we have to do something about asylum. And to be honest with you you have to get rid of judges.Every time â and you wonât even believe this Mr. Secretary General â you catch somebody thatâs coming illegally into your country and they bring them to a court. But we canât bring them to a court because you could never have that many judges. So they take their name they take their information and they release them. Now we donât release too many. We keep them. Itâs called âcatch and keep.â But you donât have facilities for that. But you have to bring them through a court system. If they touch your land âone foot on your land: âWelcome to being Perry Mason. You now have a big trial.âThe âwe have to get rid of judgesâ comment has raised some alarm from people who are especially attuned to any apparent Trump attack on democratic legitimacy and the rule of law. Even people who are properly understanding the âjudgesâ comment as being about immigration judges are taking this as a serious declaration by Trump that he wants to end due process for people seeking asylum in the United States.Although the comment is a vivid example of the presidentâs attitude toward migrants who have a legal right to seek asylum in the US given that it was part of a press appearance in which Trump lied about his fatherâs birthplace and repeatedly pronounced âoriginsâ as âorangesâ it would be foolish to take this comment as a statement of imminent administration policy.The Trump administration is trying to allow fewer asylum seekersUnsurprisingly Trumpâs comments do not reflect the reality of American immigration law.People apprehended crossing into the US without papers specifically do nohave the right to a hearing before an immigration judge to determine if they can be deported (unlike people arrested by immigration agents while living in the US). Theyâre eligible for whatâs called âexpedited removalâ or deportation without a court hearing.However the US has an obligation under domestic and international law not to return people to persecution â something that could happen if everyone were deported with no questions asked. So if a migrant says she fears persecution in her home country she has a right to a screening interview with an asylum officer to see if sheâll be allowed to apply for asylum in the US.This is what Trump is talking about with his âone foot on your landâ comment â the right to seek asylum is triggered as soon as a migrant sets foot on US soil which is why the Trump administration is more successful alimiting asylum seekers from entering the US at ports of entrtrying to stop people from being able to seek asylum after theyâd arriveIf the asylum officer determines during the screening interview that the migrant has a âcredible fearâ of persecution if returned the asylum seeker is allowed to stay file an application and get a hearing before a judge. If the asylum officer determines there isnât a credible fear the asylum seeker can appeal the decision to a judge but the odds of getting a judge to overturn a negative finding are diminishing under Trump.âCredible fearâ is a deliberately generous standard because it is designed to reduce the odds that someone is sent back who should be protected. The standard for the judge approving the asylum application is deliberately higher.The gap between approval rates for the two is a source of great frustration for the Trump administration which sees it as evidence of either outright fraud or at least overly generous screening processes. (The argument is that between an asylum seeker passing her credible fear screening and having her court appearance she could disappear into the US as an unauthorized immigrant; while a substantial number of families seeking asylum donât show up for court hearings itâs not at all clear that the majority of them are deliberately absconding.)But the administrationâs solution isnât to eliminate the court process. Itâs to have fewer people pass the credible fear screening.Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a ruling last year limiting the extent to which victims of domestic and gang violence could claim persecution â his ruling initially applied to screening interviews as well as the final evaluation of asylum applications until a judgeruled against its use in âcredible fearâ screenings in Decembe. The Trump administrationâs asylum ban attempted to hold asylum seekers who crossed between ports of entry to a higher standard â known as âreasonable fearâ â to avoid deportation without a hearing; that also got struck down in court.Currently under the Migrant Protection Protocols some migrants are being held to an even higher standard to avoid being returned to Mexico while their asylum cases are on a judicial docket. That policy hasnât yet been struck down by a judge. But even asylum seekers who fail that screening are going before an immigration judge; itâs just a matter of forcing them to wait in Mexico before they do it.Recent reports from Border Patrol union officers indicate the administration may be trying to take credible fear screenings out of asylum officersâ hands entirely and having Border Patrol agents do them themselves â which union officials assume will lead to fewer migrants passing the screenings. That also raises a lot of legal and policy questions and may or may not happen especially since Border Patrol agents are already overwhelmed in dealing with unprecedented numbers of families coming into the US without papers.Trump occasionally insists on something vehemently enough that his administration is forced to create a policy that resembles his rants but itâs not very frequent. Instead the story of immigration under the Trump administration is that the administration is doing a lot of things that Trump may not know about or understand.Rep.

Elizabeth Warren 2020: âWe should get rid of the filibusterâ - VoLog In or Sign UElizabeth Warren: âWe should get rid of the filibusterâWarren makes the case that the filibuster has perpetuated racism and economic inequality.Elizabeth Warren: âWe should get rid of the filibusterâDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attends the National Action Networkâs annual convention on April 5 2019 in New York City.Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to be clear: The filibuster â a Senate procedure that has been used to essentially require 60 votes on any piece of legislation â is racist and should be abolished.âFor generations the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justiceâ Warren said at Rev. Al Sharptonâs civil rights group National Action Networkâs convention Friday. âAnd in recent years itâs been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything.âWarren was explicit. If Democrats reclaim power they should get rid of the filibuster she said.âSo let me be as clear as I can. When Democrats next have power we should be bold and clear: Weâre done with two sets of rules â one for the Republicans and one for the Democratsâ Warren said. âAnd that means when Democrats have the White House again if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country then we should get rid of the filibuster.âThe filibuster has become the center of one of the biggest government reform debates of the 2020 presidential election cycle. The filibuster is any attempt to block or delay action on a bill by debating it at length. According to if a senator is recognized they usually have the right to the floor as long as they wish. The only way to end a filibuster in the Senate is to pass cloture which limits debate to 30 hours with the support of 60 members of the Senate.In other words because almost every bill gets filibustered in the Senate every single piece of legislation essentially needs 60 votes to pass â a rule that would inevitably serve as a death blow to bold progressive ideas like Medicare-for-all $15 minimum wage and so on.And as Warren points out the filibuster has also been used to hold back major civil rights progress in the past.âDo you know when the first bill to make lynching a federal crime was introduced? 1918â Warren said at the convention. âOne hundred years ago. And it nearly became the law back then. It passed the House in 1922. But it got killed in the Senate â by a filibuster. And then it got killed again and again and again. More than 200 times. An entire century of obstruction because a small group of racists stopped the entire nation from doing what was right.âMost 2020 candidates are reluctant to end the filibusteWarren has expressed an openness to ending the filibuster in the past. She toldthat âall the options are on the table.â Now she is cementing her position on the Senate rule.And while sheâs not completely alone in this stance â candidates South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee have also supported it â sheâs in the minority among her Senate colleagues running for president.âWe should not be doing anything to mess with the strength of the filibusterâhas said. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said she isSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has raised the concerns most filibuster defenders have: Sheâs nervous what would happen if Democrats end up in the minority. who has always campaigned on the boldest progressive ideas that donât even have the buy-in of most sitting Democratic senators says heâs ânot crazy about getting rid of the filibusterâ instead calling for statehood for the District of Columbia. Itâs a position thatsome have argued is tantamounto Sanders admitting heâs not serious about actually making any of his policies law.Thereâs no question that the filibuster makes it much harder for the Senate to pass major legislation and would render almost all the ideas that progressive 2020 candidates are currently running on extremely difficult to pass into law. There is one workaround through an obscure process called which allows the Senate to pass one piece of legislation a year with a simple majority. Itâs how Republicans attempted to repeal and replace Obamacare and passed their tax bill. But budget reconciliation has a bunch of restrictions that wouldprevent Democrats from passing minimum wage increases or robust health care change the filibuster also has given lawmakers some political cover on difficult votes:A senator can even take a position in favor of some sweeping piece of legislation and then quietly reassure interest group opponents that everyone knows this isnât getting 60 votes and really just represents an opening bid. Senators in purple states meanwhile often enjoy the ability totaking clear positions on issues. Since many areas of policy can in practice only be legislated on via bipartisan deals itâs usually possible for a member to remain ambiguous whenever that seems most suitable.Warren however isnât going to wait for progressives to suddenly take supermajorities in the Senate. And her case for getting rid of the filibuster is twofold: It not only allows for an unjust class system to worsen in this country but also perpetuates racial divides.âWe canât sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behindâ Warren said. âWe canât sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington and while too much of a childâs fate in life still rests on the color of their skin.âElizabeth Warrenâs 2020 presidential campaigElizabeth Warren: âWe should get rid of the filibusterâElizabeth Warren wants CEOs to go to jail when their companies behave badlRep.

Why Ocasio-Cortezâ Platform Is So Great | Freepress.orWhy Ocasio-Cortezâ Platform Is So GreaAlexandria Ocasio-Cortezâ platform is dramatically better than many may realize. It tackles the greatest evil in existence in a way that no other big-2 congressional candidateâs website does and which most do not even mention. And in doing so it makes serious much of the rest of her socialist platform in a way that even presidential candidate Bernie Sanders did not â a way promoted by the peace movement the Poor Peopleâs Campaign and Black Lives Matter.War and war preparations eat up 60% of the funding that Congress members decide on each year. Most candidates including most progressives refuse to mention that even while (in some cases) proposing to somehow fund massive human and environmental programs. When he ran for president Bernie Sanders was willing to accept the endlessly repeated label of âTax Increaserâ rather than say heâd cut a small fraction of the military to pay for everything he wanted.By labeling her foreign policy platform âA Peace Economyâ Ocasio-Cortez using a phrase popular with the peace movement makes the financial connection without shying away from the immoral and criminal and counter-productive character of war. Thethat war endangers rather than protecting erodes rights militarizes police and society destroys the natural environment directly kills and injures and traumatizes and harms millions and â on top of that â does the most damage through the diversion of resources from where they could do good. War is the only place where enough money sits with which to try to protect the environment or to guarantee education or retirement or other basic rights. Candidates who do not mention war spending are not serious about the things they do mention. Many like are in the pay of weapons makers as well as just about every other corporate interest.But there are exceptions you say! There are progressive leaders! There is The Resistance! Is there? Elizabeth Warrenâstells us right at the top that some wars are âunavoidableâ or in the ânational interest.â Her top priority is that wars be paid for up-front rather than creating debt. In the next breath sheâs bragging about weapons production in Massachusetts. Warren wants war-plus that is: militarism AND diplomacy. She moves on to support for imperialism in the Pacific and fear-mongering over North Korea justifying troop presence because of existing troop presence plus âeconomic interests.â Offering hypocritical accusations against China as well as North Korea as examples of her desired âdiplomacyâ Warren proposes militarism plus diplomacy plus sanctions (a very diplomatic tool donât you know) as the three-part answer.Warren jumps to pushing Russiagate propaganda declaring that Russia âhackedâ Democratic party emails revealing the DNCâs slanting of its primaries against Bernie Sanders (although she doesnât mention that that is what they revealed) and declaring this action to be (1) fact because âintelligenceâ agencies say so and (2) an âattack.â But before you can take in the WWIII significance Warren is on to demonizing Iran and backing deadly sanctions there and supporting U.S. wars in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan. Despite massive public pressure to improve Warrenâs position on Palestine remains pathetic and delusional including imagining that some geographic location remains for a second state in a two-state âsolution.âTo her credit Warren supports concrete steps to reduce nuclear weapons. But she concludes her platform with more unproven and hypocritical accusations against Russia and the very dangerous and reckless leveling of threats against anyone engaged in âcyberattacks.âWell sure you say there are always exceptions. Warren is an outlier one of those rare progressives who like the Womenâs March the Climate March the March for Our Lives MSNBC the DNC and almost every Democratic member of Congress has accidentally missed out on understanding what war and peace are all about. Still she has the best intentions and with a little help and only a small reduction in sheâd be just as great as say Bernie Sanders.But have you read Bernie Sandersâ? He too opens by proposing that war is sometimes necessary which is. Then he lists wars he opposed the start of and did little to try to end and wars he supported the start of came belatedly to regret and did little to try to end. His top priority is that wars be fought by and funded by a coalition of countries. To his credit he proposes a shift of some unspecified degree somewhat away from militarism and somewhat toward peaceful foreign relations. But he views the cost of war through U.S. troops and U.S. dollars never mentioning the vast majority of the victims of U.S. wars. And he goes on about how attacking Afghanistan was justified as an act of revenge (which is not legal moral effective â or consistent as many places could have been attacked on the same basis). Then he jumps to false accusations against Iran albeit supporting a written agreement rather than a war. His statement on Palestine is nearly identical to Warrenâs. He fear mongers terrorism but wants war with murder only no torture no lawless imprisonment no erosion of civil liberties. He wants wars that follow the rule of law despite the unmentionable fact that under the UN Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact all of these wars are illegal.Yeah yeah yeah you may reply there are always exceptions and Sanders has improved on matters of peace and war since his last campaign ended and his possible next campaign has not yet begun. But surely Iâm cherry picking. Why donât I look to an actual peace advocate like Congresswoman Barbara Lee who votes against wars and sometimes tries to end them? Despite herbeing seven years old Leeâs position is indeed far superior to if shorter and less specific than Warrenâs or Sandersâ. She focuses on spending and opposes war-making in general. She opposes âpreemptionâ even while in the end believing it theoretically possible to âexhaust all peaceful diplomatic means.âis also shorter than Warrenâs or Sandersâ but clear enough so that many specific questions have been answered in general. She avoids mealy-mouthed Washingtonian-nazistic terms like âpreemptionâ (which in fairness Lee was quoting from Bush) and denounces aggressive wars as âacts of aggression.â Without ever proclaiming herself to be yet another âoutsiderâ in politics she writes (or approves her staffâs or volunteersâ writing) as someone who actually has yet to be corrupted by the war-making capital of the earth.âSince the invasion of Iraq in 2003â she says âthe United States has entangled itself in war and occupation throughout the Middle East and North Africa. As of 2018 we are currently involved in military action in Libya Syria Iraq Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan and Somalia. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in these countries have been killed either as collateral damage from American strikes or from the instability caused by U.S. interventions. Millions more have fled their broken countries contributing to the global refugee crisis.âAlready in one paragraph Ocasio-Cortez has done six previously impossible-post-Kucinich things before breakfast. Sheâs opposed the wars as a whole. Sheâs listed them. Sheâs included Yemen. Sheâs included Libya. Sheâs named the primary victims and the guilty party. Sheâs named the cause of the refugee crisis. She continues:âThis continued action damages Americaâs legitimacy as a force for good creates new generations of potential terrorists and erodes American prosperity. In times when weâre told that thereâs not enough money Republicans and corporate Democrats seem to find the cash to fund a $1.1 trillion fighter jet program or a $1.7 trillion-dollar nuclear weapon âmodernizationâ program. The costs are extreme: the Pentagonâs budget for 2018 is $700 billion dollars: to continue fighting an endless War on Terror and refighting the Cold War with a new arms race that nobody can win.âAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is here doing what one generally has toretire in order to d: sheâs pointing out that the wars create more enemies and hostility and terrorism and danger rather than more safety and security and peace. The wars are counter-productive on their own terms on top of everything else wrong with them. She also goes after the âat least theyâre job-creatorsâ sociopathic line by pointing out that in fact they damage U.S. prosperity along with U.S. moral authority. This is a candidate from a district with much poverty denouncing in the rarest of ways one of the chief causes of that poverty in a manner that we donât tend to see in candidates from Washington D.C. suburbs but which we might start to see from some other places if we make it known that Ocasio-Cortez has this platform and wins on it. She goes on:âAccording to the Constitution the right to declare war belongs to the legislative body and yet many of these global acts of aggression have never once been voted on by Congress. In some cases weâve even acted unilaterally without the backing of the United Nations.âIn fact there has been no U.N. authorization for any of the wars in her list above. The U.N. authorized a rescue-from-a-fictional-threat in Libya not an overthrow. And the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not include the loopholes found in the U.N. Charter that is so often imagined must sometimes apply. But for Ocasio-Cortez to even mention the U.N. Charter is a giant leap forward. Watchwhen I tried to get Senator Tim Kaine to acknowledge the U.N. Charterâs existence. Alexandria goes on:âAmerica should not be in the business of destabilizing countries. While we may see ourselves as liberators the world increasingly views us as occupiers and aggressors. Alexandria believes that we must end the âforever warâ by bringing our troops home and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world.âSeveral more breakthroughs here that is: statements common in the peace movement but unheard of on television or Congressional campaign platforms. She says the U.S. is in the business of destabilizing countries. She cites the worldâs opinion. She proposes ending the wars (and foreign basing?). She does NOT mean replacing troops with aerial bombing because she says the bombing must end. And she points out that the bombing generates terrorism rather than snuffing it out. She concludes:âBy bringing our troops home we can begin to heal the wounds weâre opening by continuing military engagement. We can begin to repair our image. We can reunite military families separated by repeated deployments. We can become stronger by building stronger diplomatic and economic ties and by saving our armed forces only for when theyâre truly needed.âAnd she blows it in the end by proposing that war is sometimes needed. It. Yet how far she has come or failed to retreat in comparison with the Congress she hopes to join! And think of the legislative actions she must take if she believes in her platform and has the courage of her convictions. She must reintroduce and lobby for long-unseen economic conversion legislation. She must use the War Powers Act to force a vote on each illegal immoral disastrous war she has listed and any others like them she must seek to reduce military funding â perhaps creating legislation along with her one Congressional backer Ro Khanna along the lines of his recent attempted amendment that would have cut 5%. She must seek to block weapons sales abroad and to local police. She must introduce legislation that would make the U.S. military subject to environmental agreements that everyone else is subject to. She must work to replace military âserviceâ as a means to citizenship with free college as a right of the same. She must support diplomacy even when Trump does it. But she must support impeaching Trump for the reasons she already does plus the reasons included in her âPeace Economyâ platform.One Congress member cannot do any of this without a massive public movement that compels other Congress members to do so too. But part of so moving them must be showing our support for one among them who takes the lead. Right now the future Congress member in the lead is,1

Obama town hall Europe: avoid a âcircular firing squadâ over ideological purity - VoLog In or Sign UBarack Obama warns against a âcircular firing squadâ over ideological purity in politicâWe have to be careful in balancing bigÂ dreams and bold ideas with also recognizingÂ that typically change happens in stepsâ Obama said.Barack Obama warns against a âcircular firing squadâ over ideological purity in politicFormer President Barack Obama speaks to young leaders from across Europe in a town hall event on Saturday in Berlin Germany.Former President Barack Obama touched on growing divisions within his own party warning against pushes for ideological purity that can result in a âcircular firing squadâ in a town hall organized by the Obama Foundation in Berlin on Saturday.While taking audience questions about the frustration that comes with lack of change Obama expressed concern about a lack of compromise in Washington and said he specifically worries progressive politicians could be alienating potential allies.âOne of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States â maybe itâs true here as well â is a certain kind of rigidity where we say âOh Iâm sorry this is how itâs going to beââ Obama said. âAnd then we start sometimes creating whatâs called a âcircular firing squadâ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.âThe former president said he believes this approach âweakensâ movements and that those that would like to see a progressive agenda âhave to recognize that the way weâve structured democracy requires you to take into account people who donât agree with you.âObama ended his speech by advocating for patience and incremental change: âWe have to be careful in balancing big dreams and bold ideas with also recognizing that typically change happens in steps. And if you want to skip steps you can. Historically whatâs ended up happening is sometimes if you skip too many steps you end up having bad outcomes.âWhat else did Obama talk about?Obama took several audience questions and used them to speak at length about issues facing Europe and the United States.While the former president did not directly address President Trumpâs recent meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg or Trumpâs criticisms of the organization (the current president has said âNATO is as bad as NAFTâ for example) Obama explained why he believes NATO is important.âI canât say exactly what the United States and NATO are doing right nowâ Obama said. âI recognize that there are some strains. ... I think itâs important not to separate military alliances â the strength of Europe over the last 20 30 years has not been because there were a bunch of missiles fired. It was because â thankfully â it was because ideas won.âSpeaking about immigration in Sweden Obama said âWe canât label everybody who is disturbed by immigration as racist. You know thatâs a self-defeating tactic. You push away potential allies people who maybe just havenât thought about it ... but if theyâre exposed to new information and theyâre meeting people from other countries and they understand the nature of these different traditions and they see that others are eager to work with you then suddenly they go âAh okay.ââObama also encouraged people to take a more active role in government arguing citizens with new ideas should reach out to politicians who are open to them.âSometimes we think of the government as this âthingâ that is separate from usâ Obama said. âBut if weâre active citizens then part of our job is not just to get government to respond to you â  itâs also to improve the government.âHe added âThe point Iâm making is in addition to electing good people one of the things that you can do I think is encourage and work with governments to identify where are bottlenecks where are inefficiencies that could potentially be solved and then finding allies to help improve processes inside of government.âObama has called for ânew bloodâ in the past â and some of that new blood is at tension with the establishment over ideological puritIn an Obama Foundation event earlier this year Obama called forin the political ranks but new progressive House Democrats have at times found themselves at odds with more established party figures over issues fromrefusing to take corporate PAC moneFor the most part however Democrats have been following Obamaâs lead and have been careful to maintain unity in public.notes when Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to a question about the Green New Deal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) by saying âIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive. The green dream or whatever they call it nobody knows what it is but theyâre for it right?â Ocasio-Cortez didnât take it as a slight. Instead the first-term Congress member said âI think it is a green dream. I donât consider to be that a dismissive term.âSimilarly policy divides between Democratic 2020 candidates on issues likhave not led to open hostilities â at least not yet.When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) clearly stated âwe should get rid of the filibusteâ Friday she did not impugn any of her fellow Democrats instead arguing âFor generations the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice.

Democratic Autopsy: One Year Later | Freepress.orDemocratic Autopsy: One Year LateNorman Solomon Jeff Cohen Pia Gallegos Sam McCann and DoOriginally published at the Nation Magazine:In October 2017 a team of progressive researchers published âAutopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisiâ which probed the causes of the disastrous 2016 election defeat. The report came in the wake of the party leadershipâs failure to do its own autopsy. In a cover story forthat the âAutopsyâ is âan unemotional dissection of why the Democrats failed so miserably and it warns that the party must change profoundly or else remain a loser.âNow âDemocratic Autopsy: One Year Laterâ evaluates how well the Democratic Party has done in charting a new course since the autumn of 2017. This report rates developments in each of the seven categories that the original report assessed.The upsurge of progressive activism and electoral victories during the last year has created momentum that could lead to historic breakthroughs in the midterm elections and far beyond. Realizing such potential will require transforming and energizing the Democratic Party.Corporate Power and the PartThe Democratic Party has implemented modest reforms but corporate power continues to dominate the party. In 2017 and early summer 2018 the Democratic National Committee voted to refuse donations from a handful of toxic industries that contradict the partyâs platformâthough the ban on fossil-fuel money was effectively repealed in August 2018. Meanwhile thecontinue to freely take big corporate donations.A test for Democrats on Capitol Hill came this year when the GOP successfully worked with powerful bank lobbyists to weaken the Dodd-Frank Act (under the guise of helping small community banks). More than one-third of Senate Democrats joined the effort; many were recipients of significant banking donations. In the House 33 Democrats joined most Republicans to pass the measure; journalist David Dayen reported that nearly all of the 33 identify as corporate âNew Democrats.âIn September House minority leader Nancy Pelosi preemptivelyany potential left-populist agenda on Capitol Hill by backing reinstatement of a âpay-goâ rule to offset all new spending with tax increases or budget cuts. A former legislative director for three Democrats in Congress Justin Talbot-Zornpointing out that âbold progressivism and âpay-goâ fiscal conservatism are mutually exclusive.â He added: âThe existential challenge of climate change demands that we fully overhaul our energy and transportation infrastructure in a short period of time. The issues of Americaâs rising inequality and frayed social contractâincluding stagnant wages unaffordable college and exorbitant health care can only be fixed with major new investments.âAfter writing a recent analysis forthat looked at how Democratic leaders act on economic issues in states (from California to Connecticut) that they politically control David Sirota put his conclusions in a: Democrats in blue states âhave used their power to block single payer &amp; a public option enrich Wall St subsidize corporations slash pensions lay off teachers promote fracking &amp; engage in pay to play corruption.âFor the Democratic Party a crucial disconnect remains between rhetoric about corporate influence and subservience to it.In the summer of 2018 Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez told a predominantly black audience: âWe lost elections not only in November 2016 but we lost elections in the run-up because we stopped organizing.â¦ We took too many people for granted and African Americansâour most loyal constituencyâwe all too frequently took for granted. That is a shame on us folks and for that I apologize. And for that I say it will never happen again!âDuring the last 12 months voters of color have been key to notable electoral wins. But the party has a long way to go to fulfill Perezâs promise.In the November 2017 Virginia gubernatorial election Democrat Ralph Northam âwon three-quarters of the votes overallâ in racial-minority neighborhoods. âMargins grew by 10 percent in Hispanic neighborhoods.â Black voters turned out in higher numbers than they had before. Unfortunately Northamâs campaign spending priorities were distressingly similar to the partyâs 2016 behavior. Groups like BlackPAC and New Virginia Majority handled essential local black organizing but had aAlabamaâs special election for a Senate seat tells a similar slightly more encouraging story. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore a man accused of pedophilia and with a history of racist remarks. Jones won 96 percent of the black vote accounting for 29 percent of total votes castâmore than the stateâs 27 percent black population. BlackPAC and other groups including local NAACP chapters organized and knocked on more than 500000 doors with a tailored message addressing criminal-justice reform education and health care. The DNC also contributed to operations spending around $1 million on engaging black and millennial voters. Jones like Northam spent big onDonald Trumpâs assault on immigrants has mobilized some in the party to be stronger on immigrantsâ rights. Yet congressional Democrats were seen as having sold out Dreamers in their budget negotiations with Republicans. An April 2018 poll found that while 40 percent of Hispanics believe Democrats care about Dreamers 54 percent believe theyâre âusing this issue for political gain.âLikewise the Democratic Party must do much more to reform the police and justice systems. Eighty percent of Democrats want reform and 87 percent want to decrease the prison population. Running for Philadelphia district attorney as a comprehensive reformer Larry Krasner showed that these desires for change could beinto a winning campaign; turnout for his November 2017 election wasthan in previous DA elections. Krasner went on to implement policies such as dropping marijuana charges and dismissing problematic prosecutors in the DAâs office.Such policy approaches coupled with grassroots organizing enabled police accountability advocate Randall Woodfin to win the Birmingham Alabama mayoral race in 2017 and enabled progressive Democrat Earnell Lucas to win the race for Milwaukee County Wisconsin sheriff in August 2018. These campaigns suggest a path forward for Democratic candidatesâwhere the priority is to inspire voters and maximize turnout rather than to woo âpersuadableâ Republicans.Young People and the PartThe Democratic Party still isnât offering a bold vision that can excite young adults a demographic known for not voting much. Looking to the 2018 midterms the party put out its âBetter Deal for Our Democracâ platform. This is a modest step forwardâespecially the âCrack Down on Corporate Monopoliesââbut missing is a focus on the bread-and-butter issues that can materially affect young peopleâs lives such as redirecting resources from our bloated military towardfor free college education and Medicare for All.Young people more than their older counterparts are increasingly against obscene military budgets and US wars. But citizens with those views are without powerful representation in Washington. Sixty-eight percent of House Democrats and 85 percent of Democratic senatorsthe record-breaking 2019 military budget of over $700 billion including expansion of theOn the issue of paying for college party leaders have made a bit of progress. But instead of taking a clear stance in favor of free public college tuitionâsomething a strong majority of Democrats supportâcongressional Democrats proposed a law in July that would subsidize community colleges only and work to âmake college more affordable by reducing debt and simplifying financial aidâ asreported. Itâs a tepid approach.Like a growing number offor local and state offices as well as congressional seats most Democratic presidential contenders for 2020 have learned to push some compelling simple policy measures. But the Democratic leadership is still using a 1990s-era playbook of technocratic half-measures that donât inspireâor bring out to the pollsâAmericaâs youth.Voter Participation and the PartThe depressed turnout that cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election was due to both voter suppression efforts by Republicans and the Democratic Partyâs own inability to mobilize its base. The party has made some progress on both counts.To diminish turnout GOP strategists keep targeting people of color the young and others apt to cast ballots for Democrats. The DNCâs response has grown more robust in the past year with the creation of the âIWillVoteâ program to register new voters and fight voter suppression. The initiative has provided grants in 41 states and territories aiming to reach 50 million voters by November.The party has also supported restoring felonsâ right to vote. In April New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged to restore suffrage to felons on parole. In Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and party leaders are supporting a ballot measure to restore felonsâ voting rights.to vote has emerged as a popular and practical way to address discriminatory voter restrictions. In 2018 eight states and the District of Columbia approved or began implementing automatic voter registration. These laws were virtually nonexistent three years ago but now 13 states and DC have them.Yet most party leaders have remained hesitant to promote other clearly popular policies. And voters in marginalized communities often see scant difference between the two major parties. The Democratic Party could dramatically boost voter participation by mobilizing around progressive proposals that are such as higher taxes on the wealthy Medicare for All a $15 minimum wage stronger environmental protectionsThe Democratic Party routinely fails to take full electoral advantage of such public opinionâa major factor in its fundamental lack of credibility with voters. A Quinnipiac poll in March 2018 showed just 31 percent of the country had a positive view of Democratsâdown from 37 percent four months earlier and 44 percent a year earlier according to CNN polls. Voter turnout falls short when many are left doubting that the Democratic Party will make good on its progressive rhetoric.Social Movements and the PartFrom the party-platform struggles of 2016 through the âSummer for Progressâ coalition convened by Our Revolution in the summer of 2017 the DNC seemed tone-deaf to the policy demands of its base. When Summer for Progress activists marched to DNC headquarters in Washington they were met outside the front door byBut since mid-2017 many party leaders have been pulled along by the grassroots. The House of Representatives recently saw theof a Medicare for All caucus with at least 70 members. Even ex-President Obama. A year ago aheadline summed up the momentum: âThe stunning Democratic shift on single-payer: In 2008 no leading Democratic presidential candidate backed single-payer. In 2020 all of them might.âStudent survivors of the mass shooting at Floridaâs Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School became leaders of an intense new push for gun control. Within six weeks the #NeverAgain movement helped organize the March for Our Lives in Washingtonâwith 800 solidarity events across the countryâand a national voter-registration drive. Though most congressional Democrats had been avoiding or downplaying the gun-control issue it became hard to ignore this youth movement.Another youth-energized groundswell the climate-justice movement was dealt a slap in the face by the DNCâs reversal on accepting donations from the fossil-fuel industry. A: âThis sort of spineless corporate pandering is why Democrats keep losing.âThis has been a banner year for successful primary campaigns by progressive Democrats nationwide allied with organizations such as Our Revolution Justice Democrats Democratic Socialists of America Peopleâs Action Democracy for America Citizen Action Working Families Party and Progressive Democrats of America to name just a few groups that knocked on doors and e-mail inboxes all year. In New York State there was the defeat of powerhouse Representative Joe Crowley by 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and then a progressive deluge that unseated six âIndependent Democraticâ state senatorsâcorporatists allied with the GOP and Democratic Governor Cuomo. If thereâs a âblue waveâ in November much of the credit will belong to grassroots groups.How did the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee react to this grassroots energy? Often by intervening on behalf of(where the DCCC publicly attacked progressive candidate Laura Moser). Social movements have the ability to energize the Democratic Party but not if blocked by party leaders.Chants of âNo More Warâ from delegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention gave voice to sentiments that still resonate through the partyâs base and the broader US public notably in communities withhigher rates of military sacrific. While Trumpâs 2016 victories in swing states may have been aided by his posing as a foe of protracted war his administrationâs Middle East policies have exposed that masquerade. Unfortunately the positions of Democratic leaders on endless war and military spending offer little alternative.Few Democrats in Congress are willing to strongly challenge the unaccountable military budget which soaks up most discretionary spending that could be redirected toward the partyâs proclaimed domestic agenda. During federal-budget negotiations early this yearâwith Trump requesting a huge Pentagon-budget increaseâNancy Pelosi boasted in an e-mail to House Democrats: âIn our negotiations Congressional Democrats have been fighting for increases in funding for defense.â The office of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer declared: âWe fully support President Trumpâs Defense Departmentâs request.â Months later an overwhelming majority of House and Senate Democrats supported the massive 2019 âNational Defense Authorization Actâ of $716 billion.Trump has a dangerous admiration for authoritarian leaders. Democrats need to condemn such admiration without succumbing to reckless bellicosity.The United States and Russia possess 93 percent of the worldâs nuclear weapons. Yet many Democratic leaders seem oblivious to the threat of armed conflict with Russiaâa peril profoundly understood by Democratic presidents during the height of the Cold War.to evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election numerous Democrats engaged in extreme rhetoric calling it an âact of warâ and âequivalentâ to Pearl Harbor. Democratic leaders have rarely acknowledged the crucial need for âa shift in approach toward Russiaâ including âsteps to ease tensions between the nuclear superpowersâ in the words of an open letter calling for âElection Security and True National Securityâ released this summer.On matters of war and peaceâfor instance the 17-year war in Afghanistan and the Trump teamâs extremely one-sided Israel-Palestine policyâtop Democrats have offered few alternative policies. Theyâve made scant objections to Trump administration actions that a director at Amnesty International USA Daphne Eviatar hasas âhugely expanding the use of drone and airstrikes including outside of war zones and increasing civilian casualties in the process.âThe party leadership has routinely been absent in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen caused primarily by the US-backed Saudi war. In March Bernie Sanders Democrat Chris Murphy and Republican Mike Lee forced a vote on their Senate resolution to end US military support for the Saudis in Yemen. In the face of White House opposition and indifference among Democratic leaders it went down to defeat (55-44) thanks to. With the disaster continuing to worsen in Yemen the House Democratic leadershipdragged its feet while progressiveeffort to get a vote on a similar measure;Â finally in late September Khanna was able to introduce the resolution with some high-level partyDemocrats often denounce the GOP for immoral and extremist domestic policies favoring the powerful. The partyâs failure to challenge such foreign policies is a moral and political tragedy.Efforts to democratize the Democratic Party made some progress in August 2018 when the full DNC voted to bar superdelegates from voting for the presidential nominee on the first ballot. This reduction in the power of superdelegates grew out of anger among Bernie Sanders supporters about DNC favoritism for Hillary Clinton. In the end the reform passed with much support from the Clinton wing of the party and a major assist from DNC chair Tom Perez.Contrary to claims made by superdelegate defenders the reform moved toward greater racial diversity at the national convention. In 2016 the Pew Research Center found that 20 percent of superdelegates were black and about 36 percent were people of color; numbers provided by the Hillary Clinton campaign showed that convention delegates as a whole werethan superdelegatesâ25 percent black and 50 percent people of color.The DNCâS encouraging action on superdelegate reform contrasts sharply with the DNCâs failure to act on a proposal by its Unity Reform Commission to establish a Financial Oversight Committee that would present an annual report on the DNC budget to the entire DNC so that it could assess the effectiveness of expenditures and staff as required by the DNCâs Bylaws. The current Finance Committeeâentirely appointed by the DNC chairâconducts no such evaluations. A Financial Oversight Committee could help achieve what the DNC still lacks: transparency and accountability in howTo get closer to living up to its name the Democratic Party should rely on a broad base of small donors and refuse donations from corporations particularly those with interests adverse to the partyâs platform. The DNCâs reversal of its ban on fossil-fuel donations was a step backward.This summer the DNC voted in reforms to promote more openness and accessibility in presidential primaries and caucuses. The reforms urge state parties to work with their state government to combat voter suppression and implement measures such as same-day party switching and same-day registration. An extreme example of antidemocratic obstacles is in the state of New York where voters must declare their party affiliation more than six months in advance.Barriers to democracy inside the Democratic Party have obstructed efforts to make the party a powerful vehicle for progressive change. During the last year grassroots pressure has reduced some of those barriers. Looking ahead a truly democratic Democratic Party could profoundly revitalize the politics of our country.Norman Solomon is a journalist with a project of the Institute for Public Accuracy; the author of; and a co-founder ofJeff Cohen is the founder of the media watch group FAIR and co-founder of RootsAction.org.Pia Gallegos is the Chair of the Adelante Progressive Caucus of the Democratic Party of New Mexico.Sam McCann is a writer and researcher whose recent projects include Michael MooreâsDonna Smith is the National Advisory Board Chair of Progressive Democrats of America.,1

Google will offer some benefits for contractors after internal protest - VoLog In or Sign UGoogle will extend some benefits to contract workers after internal protesThe sudden layoff of 34 contract programmers angered employees and contractors alike.Google will extend some benefits to contract workers after internal protesGoogle employees and contractors walk off the job to protest the companyâs handling of sexual harassment claims on November 1 2018 in Mountain View California.Google employees are rewriting workplace rules at one of the worldâs largest tech companies.Following months of pressure from workers Google announced on Tuesday that it will start requiring contract companies to provide some benefits to the thousands of contract employees who work every day with Googleâs full-time employees at company offices around the world.Google said firms that provide it with contract workers must offer them paid sick days paid parental leave comprehensive health care and tuition reimbursement according to a spokesperson for Google. These contract companies which include catering businesses and cleaning services must also agree to pay workers at least $15 an hour.This is no small thing.Temporary workers contract employees and vendors (collectively known aknown as TVCs) now make up a huge part of Googleâs global workforce â. That includes everyone from cafeteria cooks to software engineers. But unlike Googleâs 90000 full-time employees contractors do not get the same pay perks or benefits. Many donât even get paid vacation.Googleâs temporary workers have grown increasingly frustrated with what they view as their second-class status and last month that frustration turned to outrage. On March 8 Google managers abruptly fired 34 contract writers on its âpersonality teamâ which developed the voice of Google Assistant in more than 50 languagesâWe demand that Google respect and uphold our existing contracts. For those whose contract was shortened we demand payment for the remaining length of the contractsâthey wrote in a lettecirculating internally which was signed by more than 900 employees and TVCs. âWe also demand that Google as a whole respect the work of contractors like those on the Personality Team. Convert contract workers to full-time employees give us the benefits and stability we deserve.âGoogle didnât respond to an email Wednesday from Vox about the workersâ demands but a spokesperson pointed to the new policy changes which addressed some of the points they raised.Several TVCs applauded the decision in a blog post Wednesday but said the laid-off employees are still waiting to hear back from Google about whether the company âwill respect our current contracts or convert us to full time positions.âGoogleâs policy change is the latest victory for Google workers who are using their collective leverage to successfully change policies they consider unfair and unethical. Their sustained pressure has prompted Google to reform itsagreements and to stop pursuing contracts to develop artificial intelligence technology for the US military. And theyâve now joined contract workers in their push for equal treatment.Contract workers have accused Google of creating an unequal workforcFull-time employees at Google have encouraged temporary workers to demand equal treatment dignity and respect.In December a group of TVCssent a scathing letter to CEO Sundar Picha accusing the tech company of creating a segregated workforce in which contract workers get paid less and get far fewer benefits than full-time employees who do the same work.Because contract workers are more likely to be people of color they also say the dynamic reinforces âa system of institutional racism sexism and discrimination.âThe letter which was shared with Vox was signed simply âTVCs at Googleâ so itâs unclear how many workers feel that way. But contractors now make up a huge part of from marketing and sales staff to computer programmers. Google has hired so many contractors in recent years that they now outnumber full-time employees (the company has aboutThe temporary workers who are employed by subcontracting firms but work in Googleâs offices said they wear different-colored badges and are often shut out of meetings and denied information needed to do their jobs.âIt is clear that we will continue to be mistreated and ignored if we stay silentâ they wrote in the letter. âGoogle has the power â âand the moneyâ â to ensure that we are treated equitably with respect and dignity.âis hardly the only US companto employ a large workforce of contractors the sheer size of the company and its temporary workforce points to a larger problematic trend within the US economy:Too many tech companies are trying to boost profit marginby hiring contractors whom they pay less and who receive fewer benefits than full-time employees on their payroll.Thousands of workers at Google donât get paid sick days or vacatioGoogle and other Silicon Valley tech companies are well known for their generous employee perks. Employees get catered parties stock options and substantial paid time off and parental leave. But less discussed is the companyâs reliance on contract workers which Bloomberg describes as a ââ that does all the grunt work for less compensation.

But here are a few paragraphs that capture the dynamic and why employees believe itâs problematic:Before each weekly Google all-hands meeting trays of hors dâoeuvres and sometimes kegs of beer are carted into an auditorium and satellite offices around the globe for employees who wear white badges. Those without white badges are asked to return to their desks.Googleâs Alphabet Inc. employs hordes of these red-badged contract workers in addition to its full-fledged staff. They serve meals and clean offices. They write code handle sales calls recruit staff screen YouTube videos test self-driving cars and even manage entire teams â a sea of skilled laborers that fuel the $795 billion company but reap few of the benefits and opportunities available to direct employees.letter contract workers expressed anger about this situation saying it creates an underclass within Googleâs workforce.The perceived mistreatment of contract workers was one reason that 20000 Google employees and TVCslast month at Google offices across the world. They were also angry about a New York Timesdetailing how Google paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of sexual harassment while staying silent about the alleged misconduct.âThese changes are significant and weâre inspired by the thousands of full-time employees and TVCs who came together to make this happenâ the employees responded in their blog post. âHowever even though these changes are an important step forward toacknowledging some of the needs of TVCs in genera thereâs still a long way to go.âItâs disturbingly easy to trick AI into doing something deadlHow digital technology is destroying our freedoAmazon is releasing its own AirPod look-alikeExclusive: Google cancels AI ethics board in response to outcrThe AI breakthrough that won the âNobel Prize of computingâThe absurdly high cost of insulin explaineCigna a major insurer is capping monthly insulin costs at $25.

Trumpâs absurd threat to close the border âif the drugs donât stopâ - VoLog In or Sign UTrump is blaming Mexico for the USâs drug problem. He should blame a failed war on drugs.Trump threatened to close the border âif the drugs donât stop.â But the problem isnât Mexico.Trump is blaming Mexico for the USâs drug problem. He should blame a failed war on drugs.President Donald Trump on Thursdaythat he will impose tariffs on Mexico or close the US-Mexico border âif the drugs donât stop or largely stop.âThe threat is supposed to push Mexico into action in the international war on drugs but more than anything it shows Trump doesnât understand why Mexico hasnât stopped drugs from flowing into the US. Itâs not Mexicoâs apathy; itâs that the war on drugs which Mexico is very much invested in isnât working.Mexico has been trying very hard for years to stop the flow of drugs into America. The US hasdedicated hundreds of millions of dollarand both military and law enforcement resources to Mexico for the cause while Mexico has built up its own police and military to fight drug cartels and other trafficking organizations. Mexico has sacrificed a lot here; according to the there have been 150000 intentional homicides linked to the drug war in Mexico since the government there escalated its war on drugs in 2006.But this clearly isnât working. Today drugs continue to flow freely into America â with illicit a synthetic opioid and heroin linked to tens of thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US each year as the nation deals with anTrumpâs comments put the failure on Mexico suggesting that the tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars itâs spent in this effort arenât enough. The reality is that a lot of the blame â if not most of the blame â falls on the US and a failure of American drug policy.Why the war on drugs isnât stopping drugs from MexicThe reason drugs are coming to the US is not because Mexico just one day randomly decided to send them here. Itâs because thereâs a huge demand for the drugs in the US. That demand creates a major drug market for criminal organizations which drug cartels readily tap into. In other words itâs American demand thatâs primarily driving the flow of drugs.More supply can lead to more drug use since easier access to drugs lets more people try illicit substances and get addicted to them. But there are a few reasons why the drug war which is largely focused on cracking down on supply hasnât worked.First is a concept known as the âprofit paradox.â One of the primary goals of the drug war is to make drugs more expensive by limiting their supply; the idea is that a drug habit is much more difficult to sustain if drugs are more expensive.But this also makes drugs immensely profitable. According to Jon Caulkins a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University the war on drugsthe price of drugs from production to sale in the US by as much as 10 times. This creates a paradox in which drugs are less affordable and accessible but the drugs that are sold are enormously profitable for criminal organizations despite all the trouble of smuggling the substances through Latin America and into the US. So drug cartels keep shipping drugs to the US despite the risks of military and law enforcement action.: When one source of drugs shuts down another takes its place. The name comes from the a beast that in some versions of the story grew another head when its previous one was cut off.Since drugs are so lucrative drug producers and traffickers donât just cease to exist when governments detain or kill them. The business is so profitable that someone will always be there willing to replace defunct organizations or leaders. So when Mexican and US officials someone simply replaced him as head of the Sinaloa cartel. And even if his powerful Sinaloa cartel collapsed another drug trafficking organization would just take its place. Thereâs simply too much demand for illicit drugs for a criminal organization to not take advantage of it.The effect is similar to the âballoon effectâ when cracking down on the drug trade in one area simply moves it to another area â sort of like pushing down on a balloon can simply move the air to other parts of the balloon. This effect has been documented all around the world includingThese concepts help explain why more aggressive anti-drug efforts havenât worked. A 2014by Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago found that while simply prohibiting drugs to some extent does raise their prices thereâs no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than less aggressive efforts. So escalating the drug war â what Trump is calling for here â just canât do much to stop the flow of drugs.The real answer is more addiction treatmenThese concepts are one reason border security experts say Trumpâs wallwonât stop the flow of drugs into the Uâ on top of the fact that most drugs are shipped through legal ports of entry not the illegal border crossings that a wall would attempt to prevent.These failures are also a big reason drug policy expertsas the main solution to the opioid epidemic. The thinking: If the US canât stop the supply it can at least reduce the demand by getting fewer people to use drugs.In other countries this has worked. When France opened up access to buprenorphine a highly successful opioid addiction treatment medication overdose deaths declined by 79 percent over the next five years as the number of people in treatment went up aThe American Journal on AddictionBut despite expertsâ calls Trump has not even proposed the tens of billions of dollars to treatment that expertsis necessary to combat the opioid epidemic. Meanwhile the US continues pouring tens of billions into its supply-focused drug war.And now Trump is upset that itâs not working.The opioid epidemic: America's deadliest drug overdose crisiTrump is blaming Mexico for the USâs drug problem.

Border news: Trump announces no closure but slowdowns at ports continue - VoLog In or Sign UThe border shutdown was a reality show threat but the border slowdown is reaAdd âresidents of border communitiesâ to the list of people whose lives Trump is using as leverage.The border shutdown was a reality show threat but the border slowdown is reaThe San Ysidro border crossing connecting San Diego California and Tijuana Mexico is the busiest port of entry along the US-Mexico border. Slowdowns have hit several ports as port officers are reassigned to care for migrants in Border Patrol custody.President Trump having successfully squeezed several news cycles out of a will-he-or-wonât-he reality show drama over his threats tobetween the United States and Mexico has apparently decided he prefers threatening to close the border over actually moving to do it.On Thursday Trump announced that he wouldnât close the border imminently but said it was on the table if Mexico didnât âstop or largely stopâ drugs and unauthorized immigrants from coming into the US.The announcement matters for US businesses (and people) who were worried about an imminent shutdown. But it doesnât actually change the fact that on the ground there already is a slowdown at ports of entry â for the same reason that officials not named Trump were saying port closures might be needed to begin with.And the past week has shown that using a border shutdown as a threat to get other people to do what Trump wants â especially when Trump isnât exactly defining his goals in a realistic way â affects Americans whether or not there is ever an actual announcement that âthe borderâ is closed.There is already a border slowdown and Trumpâs declaration doesnât change thaTrumpâs threats of shutting down âthe borderâ were always only a threat to shut down US ports of entry â official border crossings where people cars and trucks can come legally into the US. He canât stop people from crossing into the US between ports of entry illegally and he canât stop such people from seeking asylum in the US once theyâve set foot on US soil. (The administration has already tried to ban people who enter the US illegally from seeking asylum and got held up in court.)And even at ports what Trump talks about as an on/off switch â closing the border or not closing it â is really a dimmer: the possibility of reducing staff or shutting down lanes at individual ports of entry.That switch is already dimmed.DHS is already reassigning some staff from working at ports to supporting US Border Patrol officials in the care and processing of apprehended migrants. On Monday Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen ordered 750 port staff to be reassigned and directed Customs and Border Protection (which oversees both ports and Border Patrol) to look into the possibility of shifting as many as 2000 port officers.For everyone in Trumpâs administration other than Trump that was the basis for talking about closing ports of entry entirely. While Trump talked about it as a bargaining chip administration officials talked about it as a necessary act of logistics.âWhy are we talking about closing the border?âacting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney aske(rhetorically) in a Sunday interview on ABC. âNot for spite and not to â not to try and â and undo whatâs happening but to simply say look we need the people from the ports of entry to go out and patrol in the desert.âThe reassignment of hundreds of officers has caused unusual slowdowns at various ports over the past few days. On Monday the port crossing at Otay Mesa in California closed for the night with 150 trucks waiting to cross; on Wednesday lines to cross into El Paso from Ciudad Juarez were so long that the local government of Juarez brought port-a-potties to relieve people waiting.Bridge wait times are so long at the Bridge of the Americas that Juarez has brought in port-a-potties for anyone stuck in traffic. (Courtesy: Beto Delgado)The ports along the border that are affected and vary from day to day. That makes sense given that the reason for the shutdown is reallocating staff hours. More importantly it makes sense if the administration is trying to minimize the disruption to trade and legal border crossings.Declaring flatly that the border is âclosedâ would do the exact opposite â it would have maximized the disruption.Thatâs consistent with the way Trump talks about closing the border: as a threat to get everybody else to comply with what he wants.Trump uses border closure as a bargaining chiAt first Trump was attempting to pitch a border closure as an affirmatively good thing for the US saying it would benefit the American economy because of the trade deficit (which is economically illiterate).He later stopped doing that â acknowledging what have reportedly been repeated briefings from top White House economic staff explaining to him that it would be a very bad idea for American businesses as well as Mexican ones.Instead heâs now explicitly calling it a bargaining chip.âIf we donât make a deal with Congress or if Mexico â and probably you can say âand/orââ â if Mexico doesnât do what they should be doingâ by stopping people from coming Trump said Tuesday âthen weâre going to close the border. Thatâs going to be it.âIn that respect his announcement Thursday that he wouldnât close the border was barely a reprieve. Because what Trump is demanding in return â that Mexico stop or âlargely stopâ drugs and migrants from entering the US â is at worst impossible and at best impossible to define.The Mexican government has generally cooperated with the Trump administration on migration (and has been stepping up its interdictions of migrants over the past week days before Trump acknowledged that Mexico was âfor the first timeâ stopping migrants) but itâs impossible to stop everyone from coming to the US. While Mexicoâs administration initially granted large numbers of temporary visas to Central American migrants to travel legally through Mexico en route to the US when President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador took office in December they stopped that policy after a month â and the number of families coming to the US has only spiked since then.Trump is essentially asking that Mexico do something in a year that itâs been trying and failing to do for the past 15 years: eradicate human and drug smuggling in the country. And because heâs not clarifying what âlargely stopâ means heâs raising the chance that Mexico could do everything possible and still not please him.Itâs hard to successfully use threats to get your way if youâre not clear about what exactly you want.Trump has done this before. His efforts to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program featured a six-month period for Congress to take legislative action to help the 700000 young unauthorized immigrants DACA protected from deportation before those expirations began to expire en masse. Those negotiations were already falling apart before a federal judge stepped in and stopped Trump from ending DACA (a court battle the Supreme Court is almost certain to take up next term).Now DACA is in a zombie state in which unauthorized immigrants who had DACA protections before Trump tried to rescind them are allowed to keep renewing but are forced to continually consider how to maximize the time theyâll be protected if the Supreme Court sides with Trump.Hundreds of thousands of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are in an even more dire position. They too are protected by a court ruling that stopped Trump from ending their legal status. But if a future court ruling goes against them some could lose protections immediately if thatâs what the administration chooses to do.Just last week Trump made the decision to extend a similar set of protections to hundreds of Somali immigrants just days before they were set to lose their status. And now heâs giving Mexico â and everyone who lives works or trades along the US-Mexico border â a similar âreprieve.âThe uncertainty itself matters. Mexican growers and the US businesses that import their produce will be forced for the next year to think about whether they should plan for a border closure in spring of 2020 or whether they should go on with business as usual and risk catastrophic losses if the border is closed. People who live in Mexico but work in the US will spend a year wondering if theyâll be able to get to work come next April â just like the DACA and TPS recipients who wonder if theyâre going to be able to keep their jobs or whether theyâll have to be fired once they lose their permission to work legally in the US.Trump thinks of threats as leverage. But theyâre only leverage because they cause pain.Rep.
