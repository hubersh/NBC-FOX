Trugman at the New York Post reported this week that the final numbers for the Obama Administration are in and they are abysmal:On Thursday we closed the book on the Obama economic Ì¢åÛåÏmiracleÌ¢åÛå Ì¢åÛåÓ and itÌ¢åÛåªs a miracle we are not in a recession.Last week the Commerce Department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product. The number came in at a paltry 2.1 percent meaning that growth during President ObamaÌ¢åÛåªs final year in office Ì¢åÛåÓ the end of an Ì¢åÛåÏError of HopeÌ¢åÛå Ì¢åÛåÓ landed with a big thud at just 1.6 percent.That low-water mark puts the Obama presidency in last place among all the post-World War II presidents when it comes to economic growth.The rate of real economic growth is the single greatest determinant of both AmericaÌ¢åÛåªs strength as a nation and the well-being of the American people.From 1790 to 2000 U.S. RGDP growth averaged 3.79%. America needs at least 3.0% economic growth-the nation cannot defend itself and pay its bills without it. However AmericaÌ¢åÛåªs elites have largely given up on growth and are now distracting themselves with academic musings about Ì¢åÛåÏsecular stagnation.Ì¢åÛåBy February of 2016 it was clear that Obama had given up on economic growth. ObamaÌ¢åÛåªs Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasted in early 2016 that America will never see 3.0% economic growth again.As a result of his failed economic policies Obama now ranks as the fourth worst presidency on record in GDP growth at 1.6%. Only Herbert Hoover (-5.65%) Andrew Johnson (-0.70%) and Theodore Roosevelt (1.41%) currently have lower average annual GDP growth than Barack Obama. In addition Obama has the lowest annual GDP growth rate of any President since World War II.Barack Obama is the only U.S. president in history who did not deliver a single year of 3.0%+ economic growth.Here are the average growth rates for each president since World War II:G.H.W.

Virginia should do more to help foster kids find homes with family advocates say - Daily PresVirginia should do more to help foster kids find homes with family advocates saAileen Devlin/Daily Press / Daily PresDemocratic state Sen. Monty Mason walks to his seat on the first day of the Virginia General Assembly at the State Capitol in Richmond on Wednesday Jan. 10 2018. (Aileen Devlin/Daily Press / Daily Press)Virginia is full of grandparents and other relatives eager to take care of children otherwise headed for foster care but the state lags the rest of the nation when it comes to making this common-sense idea happen new data show.The problem advocates for children say is money.When a relative wants to take in a child they donÛªt receive the payments that foster care parents or group homes do.ÛÏIf youÛªre going to be a foster parent for my kid youÛªd get $700 a month; if my brother does he gets nothingÛ said state Sen. Monty Mason D-Williamsburg.ÛÏReal world case: I had a couple come in he works at the ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Control department) warehouse Û_ his sisterÛªs not not doing well and theyÛªve got two hours to decide what to do about her kids. If they donÛªt help the boy goes to Virginia Beach the girl to RoanokeÛ Mason said. ÛÏSo of course they take the kids. Now theyÛªve got five and debtÛªs piling up and theyÛªre struggling.ÛOnly 7 percent of Virginia children in foster care have a place with a relative the Annie E. Casey FoundationÛªs latest analysis of federal Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System data show.That percentage hasnÛªt changed in 10 years and is a fraction of the national average of 32 percent.Mason says the figures miss an important trend ÛÓ the overall number of children in foster care in Virginia is down in part because of a stepped-up effort to find alternatives. Often thatÛªs an informal agreement for a relative to care for a child.ÛÏBut thereÛªs no help for them Û_ and you know you bring a 13-year-old boy into your home your grocery bill is going to soarÛ Mason said.That kind of informal diversion doesnÛªt count as kinship care but even when a child formally enters the foster care system and is placed with relatives thereÛªs no stipend Mason said.Tackling that needs to be a top priority said Allison Gilbreath a policy analyst with Voices for VirginiaÛªs Children a non-profit advocacy group.ÛÏAll the data show children do much better with kinship placementÛ she said. ÛÏThey usually know the child better. TheyÛªre more likely to stick with them too.ÛChildren in kinship care are more likely to be adopted or to end up back with their birth parents which is supposed to be the systemÛªs top goal Gilbreath said.authorized the state to tap into a federal program that pays some kinship guardians. But only about 100 kids are eligible for this Gilbreath said.The reason is that to get the assistance the child must have lived with the relative for six months and the relative must have completed state training to become a certified foster parent. In addition the federal program says it wonÛªt pay unless the child is never going to return to his or her birth parents ÛÓ a decision children can make only after theyÛªve turned 14.Gilbreath said she hopes Virginia will expand access by creating a separate funding stream for kinship care as other states have.Virginia foster care kids are far less likely than young people elsewhere in the nation to find a permanent placement ÛÓ only 24 percent of Virginia children do compared to 43 percent for the nation as a whole according to the data compiled by the Casey Foundation.Since many kids in foster care got there because of trauma at home they often need help that other children donÛªt ÛÓ and making sure they have access to those services ought to be another state priority Gilbreath said.ÛÏYou may have taken in a child and suddenly you have to figure out Û÷How do I sign them up for school? WhereÛªs the other help they need?Ûª Û Gilbreath said.SheÛªs hoping the new federal Family First Prevention Services Act will bring money and evidence-based services to help kids. Mason meanwhile sponsored the legislation this year that aims at getting Virginia on a fast track to tap those federal resources.Pictures from Daily Press PhotographerVirginia is full of grandparents and other relatives eager to take care of children otherwise headed for foster care but the state lags the rest of the nation when it comes to making this common-sense idea happen new data show.The problem advocates for children say is money.,0

Last week he voted for the Democratic candidate in a special state Senate election in PittsburghÛªs affluent southern suburbs.ÛÏA decade ago I probably wouldnÛªt have even noticed this election was happeningÛ Heitman said ÛÏbut IÛªm making a point in voting in every one I can nowadays.ÛThe DemocratsÛª 2020 presidential primary may feature a historically diverse field of women and minorities but in some ways it is testing how the party appeals to white men such as Heitman. Many Democratic politicians went into the last presidential campaign cycle taking little account of those voters and banked on a coalition of women and minorities to carry them to victory. TrumpÛªs victory proved that thinking wrong.ThatÛªs left Democrats wondering whether the nominee should be someone who can cut deep into TrumpÛªs base ÛÓ working-class whites ÛÓ whether itÛªs enough to win over affluent college-educated suburban men and whether party is moving to far left to win them both.Mike Wessell center a Republican-turned Democrat talks with other supporters for democratic party candidate for Pennsylvania state senator Pam Iovino at her election returns party in Pittsburgh. Some Democrats thought they didnÛªt need white male voters in 2016. But the party knows it needs them in 2020.(Photo: Keith Srakocic / AP)ÛÏThe white male vote is indispensable itÛªs a part of any winning coalitionÛ said Democratic pollster Ronald Lester who worked for Hillary ClintonÛªs campaign in 2016. He noted that successful national Democrats perform well with white men and that includes Barack Obama whose strength among white men in the Rust Belt helped fuel his White House victories.Several candidates have jumped in with their own suggestions of how to do that.Former Vice President Joe Biden who hasnÛªt said whether he is running spoke to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in an appearance Friday that seemed designed to show how he could win back white working-class voters. Biden said some of his ÛÏsophisticated friendsÛ donÛªt understand the need to treat laborers with respect.ÛÏHow the hell do we get to the place where a lot of you think the rest of the country doesnÛªt see you or know you?Û Biden asked the mostly male crowd.When Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio announced his campaign earlier in the week he said his more centrist approach could appeal to working-class voters like those in his district which embodies the Rust Belt terrain that Trump won.Sen. Amy Klobuchar D-Minn. said her no-frills style has delivered white Midwestern voters before. Former Rep. Beto OÛªRourke D-Texas uses his star appeal that helped him in TexasÛª well-educated suburbs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has said his economic populism will bring rural white voters back to the Democratic fold.Polling makes clear why Democratic are searching for the right messenger.White men make up typically make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018 41 percent of them voted for Democrats according to AP VoteCast a survey of the national electorate. While DemocratsÛª strength among women won headlines and was often credited with the DemocratsÛª strong showing white men also moved to the Democrats. VoteCast showed Democrats won the votes of 46 percent of white male college graduates a figure thatÛªs buoyed some in the party.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/07/democrats-white-male-voters/39314679/,0

Security Council. The U.S. has never been a member of the ICC a court of last resort that prosecutes grave crimes only when other nations are unwilling or unable to bring suspects to justice.Bensouda is expected to brief the Security Council next month on her investigations in Libya.The State Department confirmed the measure.ÛÏIn this case where Prosecutor Bensouda has publicly stated that her visa has been revoked we confirm that the ProsecutorÛªs visa to the United States has been revokedÛ the department said in a statement.It declined to discuss other cases but said that ÛÏthe United States will take the necessary steps to protect its sovereignty and to protect our people from unjust investigation and prosecution by the International Criminal Court.ÛU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that Washington would revoke or deny visas to ICC staff seeking to investigate alleged war crimes and other abuses committed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan or elsewhere and may do the same with those who seek action against Israel.The ICC prosecutor has a pending request to look into possible war crimes in Afghanistan that may involve Americans. The Palestinians have also asked the court to bring cases against Israel.Pompeo said in March that his move was necessary to prevent the court from infringing on U.S. sovereignty by prosecuting American forces or allies for torture or other war crimes.Bensouda asked last year to open an investigation into allegations of war crimes committed by Afghan national security forces Taliban and Haqqani network militants as well as U.S. forces and intelligence officials in Afghanistan since May 2003.The request says there is information that members of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies ÛÏcommitted acts of torture cruel treatment outrages upon personal dignity rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations principally in the 2003-2004 period.ÛThe United States has never been a member of the Hague-based court even though the Clinton administration in 2000 signed the Rome Statute that created it. However he had reservations about the scope of the courtÛªs jurisdiction and never submitted it for ratification to the Senate.When President George W. Bush took office in 2001 his administration passed the American Service Members Protection Act which sought to immunize U.S. troops from potential prosecution by the ICC. In 2002 U.S. national security adviser John Bolton then a State Department official traveled to New York to ceremonially ÛÏunsignÛ the Rome Statute at the United Nations.In a speech to the American Society of International Law late last month ICC President Chile Eboe-Osuji paid tribute to American involvement in previous international courts from the post-World War II trials of Nazis in Nuremberg to U.N. tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.He urged Washington to support the ICC ÛÏwhose values and objectives are entirely consistent with the best instincts of America and her values.ÛAssociated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington D.C. contributed to this report.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Abolish the Electoral College? Proceed at One's Own Risk. | RealClearPoliticAbolish the Electoral College? Proceed at One's Own Risk.Abolish the Electoral College?

Proceed at One's Own Risk.Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...The push to abolish the Electoral College is picking up steam as Democrats turn their attention to the 2020. Former Attorney General Eric Holder is among the latest high-profile Democrats to call for eliminating the age-old system deeming it a ÛÏvestige of the pastÛ and ÛÏundemocratic.Û Some of the Democrats in the crowded 2020 field ranging from South Bend Ind. Mayor Peter Buttigieg to Sens. Elizabeth and Kirsten Gillibrand had previously sounded the call. Warren has argued for a change in which ÛÏevery vote matters.ÛA group of big-state Democratic senators including Gillibrand (New York) Dick Durbin (Illinois) and Dianne Feinstein (California) introduced a constitutional amendment Tuesday that would jettison the Electoral College. The measure is mostly an exercise to spur debate because such amendments require two-thirds majority votes in both the chambers of Congress and GOP Senate leaders would no doubt block it from receiving any floor consideration.Complaints about the Electoral College arose in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote narrowly over George W. Bush but was denied the presidency after a fiercely contested Florida recount put Bush in the White House. The Democratic push this time is more than grousing. Amid the partyÛªs continued furor over Hillary ClintonÛªs 2016 loss to Donald Trump even though she won the popular vote it has become a rallying cry.If American history is any guide however both major political parties should be careful what they wish for. Altering the Constitution doesnÛªt always produce the expected consequences. RepublicansÛª rage over Franklin RooseveltÛªs decision to break precedent and seek a third (and then a fourth) term led directly to the 2Amendment. Passed by Congress in 1947 it was ratified in enough states to take effect in 1951. Its most obvious result was to deny Dwight Eisenhower a chance to run in 1960 a race heÛªd have been favored to win. Goodbye Camelot.The Republican establishment hasnÛªt learned that lesson. To them the equation is clear: Defending the traditional system puts the GOP in the best position for President Trump to win a second term. But some Republicans wonder if the conventional wisdom is short-sighted. For starters these contrarians are concerned with how the existing Electoral College dynamic has reduced civic engagement in whole areas of the country from the deeply red South rural Plains and mountain West to the millions of essentially disenfranchised Republicans in Democrat-dominated California. Such places are ignored every four years as the two major parties and their respective presidential tickets spend almost all of their time and treasure in roughly a dozen battleground states.Of more pressing concern these GOP contrarians also point out that the electoral map that currently favors them is not set in stone.In addition Republicans who support shifting to greater reliance on the popular vote argue that in five to 10 years their candidates may find themselves at a disadvantage even under the current system. ThatÛªs because demographics are changing palpably and Republicans might well lose their ability to win the important swing state of Florida and possibly even the GOP anchor state of Texas.In 2010 according to the U.S. Census Hispanics made up 23 percent of FloridaÛªs population. Projections put that figure at nearly 26 percent in 2017. FloridaÛªs Cuban-Americans once reliably Republican are now split with the younger generation increasingly voting Democratic. Following Hurricane Maria Puerto Ricans who trend Democratic have moved to Florida by the tens of thousands.Popular Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis could help blunt Democratic inroads in the near term but keeping the Sunshine State in play might require significant recalibration.Texas is another important consideration. It certainly is solidly red today: The Lone Star State has voted Republican in the last 10 elections. But itÛªs worth taking a closer look. In six of those elections a Texan named George Bush was on the GOP ballot. And in the previous 20 elections going back to William McKinley the state went for every Democratic presidential nominee except Al Smith in 1928 Richard Nixon in 1972 and both times Adlai Stevenson faced World War II hero Dwight Eisenhower. Otherwise the map was a sea of Democratic blue.The point here is that over time the political leanings of states change sometimes radically. For a while they may swing purple. They may stay that way or they may move to the other camp. Sometimes their reputations lag behind the reality. From the time of the Civil War to the onset of the Great Depression Maine was the great bellwether leading to the mantra taught to schoolchildren across the country: ÛÏAs Maine goes so goes the nation.Û In 1936 however Franklin Roosevelt swept every state in the union except Maine and Vermont leading to a puckish quip from FDR campaign manager James Farley ÛÏAs Maine goes so goes Vermont.Û But the latter state has changed too. Until Patrick Leahy was elected in the 1970s Vermont had never had a Democratic senator. Today itÛªs so liberal that LeahyÛªs home-state Senate colleague felt the need to hyphenate the word ÛÏDemocratÛ and attach ÛÏSocialist.Û Republicans need not apply.Could such a metamorphosis take place in Texas? Why not it happened only a generation ago in California. And last year Democrat Beto OÛªRourke came within two percentage points of ousting Sen. Ted Cruz. Was that an anomaly or the first signs of a purple flower blooming? Just a month before the election a Quinnipiac survey found OÛªRourke leading among voters under the age of 50 with the support of 66 percent of likely voters between the ages of 18 and 34 while Cruz held a significant lead among older voters.A March 1 Quinnipiac poll of possible 2020 matchups has Trump essentially tied in the state with Joe Biden Bernie Sanders and OÛªRourke.ÛÏIf Florida and Texas shift to the Democrats you look at that blue wall and thereÛªs zero path to victory for Republicans using the current winner-take-allÛ Electoral College system Saul Anuzis the former Republican Party chairman in Michigan told RealClearPolitics.History suggests that this warning is exaggerated. For one thing historically Democratic bastions such as Michigan Wisconsin Minnesota and Pennsylvania could very well move in the other direction.Moreover Anuzis is not pessimistic. He and others are suggesting that if Republicans are forced to compete for the popular vote it could ultimately strengthen the GOP by making it less of a regional party and leaving it less reliant on an aging demographical cohort: namely white voters.These would-be reformers have aligned themselves with a movement called the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (Anuzis is a senior consultant). It would go into effect when enacted by states collectively possessing a majority of the electoral votes necessary to elect a president: 270 out of 538. Instead of each state designating all of its electoral votes to the winner of that stateÛªs popular vote those states in the compact would agree to hand over their electors to the candidate who receives the most votes across the nation.Unlike the Democratic Party push to abolish the Electoral College which would take a constitutional amendment thecompact preserves it but lessens its power. While national political figures clash over the Electoral College a growing number of states have already quietly moved to largely bypass it by approving the compact. Last week DelawareÛªs governor signed the compact into law just weeks after Colorado did the same. On Wednesday New Mexico followed suit.Eleven other states and the District of Columbia have likewise done so with the initiative nearing the 200 mark for combined electoral votes but still significantly shy of the 270 needed to switch the system. åÊThatÛªs one more reason advocates say Trump supporters shouldnÛªt fear the popular vote compact ÛÒ it has no real chance of becoming law in enough states to replace the Electoral College by 2020.ItÛªs also based on federalism and respect for state rights Anuzis explained and if itÛªs not working the way states planned state legislatures can change it. Under the compact instead of presidential candidates focusing all their time and money on a small number of battleground states every four years and showering those states with pet projects and federal spending to help woo voters there candidates would be forced to spend time campaigning across the country.ÛÏIf you look at little bit beyond Trump and look at the hard math and shifting demographics going to a system that encourages everyone to vote and candidates to talk to as many people as possible Republicans have a chance of winning in a very fair fightÛ said Anthony Delcollo a Republican member of the Delaware Senate who co-sponsored the compact bill.Before winning the Electoral College Trump expressed distrust of the system frequently referring to it as ÛÏrigged.Û He was onto something Delcollo argued because the system is rigged against Republicans with an estimated 240 electors coming from traditionally blue states and only 115 from traditionally red ones.ÛÏIf Texas does become a swing state in the future then that number drops to roughly 70Û Delcollo said. ÛÏIf Texas becomes purple it becomes very very hard to win in the Electoral College and if Florida becomes blue that means a Democrat would win every single timeÛ ÛÒ assuming of course that other states donÛªt shift in the opposite direction.Before his 2016 victory upended conventional wisdom in 2012 Trump used similar language to decry the Electoral College calling it a ÛÏdisaster for democracy Û_ a total sham and a travesty.ÛEven a month after his win Trump was still naturally inclined to favor a popular vote system telling CBSÛª ÛÏ60 MinutesÛ that he would rather have a process that depends on ÛÏsimple votesÛ as he phrased it.ÛÏYou know you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million and you winÛ Trump said. ÛÏThereÛªs a reason for doing this. Because it brings all the states into play.ÛAfter Democrats started gunning for the Electoral College Trump changed his mind recently arguing on Twitter that ÛÏwith the popular vote you go to just the large states ÛÒ the cities would end up running the country. Smaller states and the entire Midwest would up losing all power &amp; we canÛªt let that happen.ÛThe president seemed to echo sentiments from some of his most ardent supporters on the right who want to preserve the system that handed him his surprise victory. But Democrats are working overtime to prevent a repeat performance strategically holding their national convention in Milwaukee Wis. as a show of force in a state Clinton neglected -- and failed to win.Victor Davis Hanson became the latest conservative to push back against progressive DemocratsÛª calls to scrap the two-century-old tradition of granting electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote within each state.The Electoral College was designed in part to ensure that candidates ÛÏat least visited the small and rural states of AmericaÛ Hanson wrote in. ÛÏThe Û_ Founding Fathers did not want elections to rest solely with larger urban populations. The Electoral College balances out the popular vote.ÛHanson characterized the attacks on the system as an unprincipled power grab aimed at preventing another Trump win which could again happen without carrying the popular vote.Supporters of the popular vote countered by stressing that the nationÛªs five biggest cities ÛÒ New York Los Angeles Chicago Houston and Philadelphia ÛÒ represent just 6 percent of the countryÛªs population. Moreover the population of the 50 biggest cities represents only 15 percent of the population.Besides they say itÛªs a myth that the Founders established the Electoral College to prevent elections from becoming contests where presidential candidates would simply campaign in big cities because in the late 1700s 95 percent of the population lived in places with fewer than 2500 people.ÛÏItÛªs basically a travesty that a small selection of swing states decide our president and they get more funding per capita and they wash out the voice of all the statesÛ Delcollo said. ÛÏThereÛªs nothing small-government or conservative about that.ÛSusan Crabtree is a veteran Washington reporter who has spent two decades covering the White House and Congress.National Popular Vote Interstate CompacLog In with your RCMG Accoun,0

(AP) -said Monday that his administration has renewed its challenge to a regulatory panelÛªs approval of Enbridge EnergyÛªs plan to replace its aging Line 3 crude oil pipeline across northern Minnesota saying he wants to let the legal process play out.told reporters the Commerce Department refiled its appeal last week with the Minnesota Court of Appeals which had dismissed earlier appeals in the case on procedural grounds. The independent Public Utilities Commission last month gave its final reaffirmation of its earlier approvals of the project clearing the way for the department and the environmental and tribal groups to refile appeals that began under previous Gov Mark DaytonÛªs administration.ÛÏWe think that that appeal should simply be heard and thatÛªs fairÛ he said.The Democratic governor said the stateÛªs appeal doesnÛªt delay the timeline for the permitting process for or construction on the replacement pipeline because the state isnÛªt seeking an injunction. Regulators have told Enbridge that they expect to certify all remaining state permits by November. The company hopes to put the new pipeline into service in the second half of 2020.Calgary Alberta-based Enbridge wants to replace Line 3 which was built in the 1960s because itÛªs increasingly prone to cracking and corrosion. Native American and environmental groups argue that the project risks oil spills in pristine areas of the Mississippi River headwaters region and that the Canadian tar sands oil that the line would carry accelerates climate change.Enbridge said in a statement that it believes the courts will affirm the commissionÛªs decisions ÛÏwhich were made in accordance with the law based on full and complete evidence developed and presented over years of open and transparent regulatory and environmental review processes.Ûwas critical of lawmakers whoÛªve tried unsuccessfully to prohibit the state from spending taxpayer money on the appeal calling their efforts ÛÏa gross violation of the separation of powers.ÛThe legal issue at the heart of the Commerce DepartmentÛªs appeal is whether Enbridge provided legally adequate long-range demand forecasts to establish the need for the project. The Public Utilities and Enbridge say the company did.said the statutory language is ambiguous and that there would no basis for the stateÛªs appeal if lawmakers clarified the statute.House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt said Republicans are ÛÏincredibly disappointedÛ by the decision to pursue a further appeal against a new pipeline that would be the ÛÏsafest most environmentally friendly wayÛ to transport the oil and would create jobs and increase property tax revenues for communities along the route.ÛÏWhat the governor is trying to do is play both sidesÛ Daudt said. ÛÏI think heÛªs trying to say that Û÷Well this is ultimately going to happen but I can at least tell the people that were against it I was with them.Ûª And to me thatÛªs a failure of leadership.ÛCopyright å© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.The Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

That's quite laughable given these are the same Democrats who aren't the slightest bit interested in oversight or transparency when it comes to their own party's dirty deeds or illicit actions by the deep state agents who spied on the 2016 Trump campaign using deceptive and misleading FISA warrants.Not to mention other pernicious actions to remove a duly elected president.Once such example is Rep. Schiff's attempt to block Congress from accessing the bank records of Fusion GPS to shield Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee which paid millions to the slimy opposition research firm for the infamous ""dirty dossier"" used by the FBI to spur the special counsel investigation. Then there's House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler who during the 1998 Bill Clinton investigation conducted by independent counsel Kenneth Starr was against the public release of details contained in the report. Back then he sought to protect grand jury testimony.All of this illustrates that when it comes to government oversight and ""transparency"" Democrats have a distinct set of rules: One for thee and none for me.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Enforcement Trumps a Border Wall | RealClearPoliticEnforcement Trumps a Border WalEnforcement Trumps a Border WalEnforcement Trumps a Border WalVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- During the two years when Democrats controlled the Oval Office Senate and House President Barack Obama squandered a major opportunity.He failed to push for a vote on a DREAM Act which would create a path to citizenship for qualified undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors. That matter was left for a vote in the lame-duck Congress; and that vote proved to be a gesture as the Democratic Senate failed to garner the needed 60 votes. America will never know how it might have ended if Obama had put his back into it.Ever since Obama's failure to push for this key promise of his 2008 campaign remains an object of contempt among conservatives -- who presume Democrats preferred to dangle the issue through the 2012 election and gin up resentment among Latino voters.With President Donald Trump's failure to push Republicans to change immigration laws when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress in 2017 and 2018 Trump may find himself in that same corner of shame.With 1 million or so undocumented migrants expected to cross the southwest border this year Trump's commitment to building his signature border wall doesn't seem to be doing the trick and he hasn't focused on measures that actually could improve the nation's immigration machinery.When Trump first got into office a big drop in southwest border apprehensions suggested his anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric had such a chilling effect that his promised wall might be superfluous. But then the numbers began to climb.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently argued that a law which prevents immigration officials from promptly returning minors from the so-called Northern Triangle countries and a court decision that limits how long the government can hold minors serve as loopholes that ""create a functionally open border.""That's why Mark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies always has argued that changing immigration law and enforcement would be far more effective than building a wall -- not that he's opposed to spending on a wall.Trump's push for the wall shows that he is working to keep to his 2016 campaign promise: But it really can't do much to discourage economic migrants who ultimately would not qualify for asylum but nonetheless believe they will be able to get into the United States through a port of entry.That's the problem with Trump's beloved wall. It may resonate with his base but it won't bring about the changes the base wants.And it's hard to get Republicans -- many of whom do not share Trump's view on illegal immigrants -- to die on a hill for a big-ticket item which the public opposes and politicians doubt will work.Krikorian doesn't think it's too late for Trump to switch his focus to changing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act so that federal officials can send undocumented minors who don't qualify for asylum back to non-contiguous countries the same way that they can return minors from Mexico and Canada.Could such a measure make it through the Democratic House? Not now but that could change if the flow of migrants through Mexico continues at such dangerous levels.""Politically it is essential for the Republicans to make it clear that [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer are the reason we have this border disaster"" said Krikorian. ""They are playing the part of [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel in inviting an unlimited number of people to come to the United States.""Krikorian believes that the GOP Senate should put its efforts on reworking immigration law so that it doesn't encourage border chaos.It doesn't help when Trump says as he did Friday morning that he wants to ""get rid of the whole asylum system."" It was another act of verbal self-sabotage that showed an executive ready to bar not only economic migrants but also refugees fearing for their lives.The week's antics with the president's since-retracted threats of closing the border with Mexico only reinforce a portrait of an executive who hasn't focused on a goal -- reducing illegal immigration -- so much as on winning.So Trump claimed victory Friday morning because Mexico has done a better job of enforcing its southern border under his threat. Does anyone think that will last when the mercurial president takes his eye off the ball?I get how the Trump base cheers on the president's ability to drive the left crazy with his rhetoric: But it's not going to fix a humanitarian crisis.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

And yes there are differences.ÛThe NATO secretary general credited President Donald Trump with compelling allies to spend more on defense without noting that Trump also has questioned the value of the alliance and suggested that some members are freeloaders.TrumpÛªs criticisms have upset a delicate balance within an alliance that has long counted on Washington to be its leader. StoltenbergÛªs speech provided a diplomatic counterpoint to TrumpÛªs sometimes derisive rhetoric and the enthusiastic reception he received from both parties in the House was testament to an enduring pro-NATO consensus in Congress.ÛÏThe secretary general delivered to Congress a powerful affirmation of the value of the NATO allianceÛ said Rep. Mac Thornberry a Texas Republican.James Stavridis a retired Navy admiral who was NATOÛªs top commander from 2009 to 2013 called the Stoltenberg address a high point in recent U.S.-European relations.ÛÏGiven the presidentÛªs evident and frequently vocalized skepticism of the alliance it is clear that Congress ÛÒ on a bipartisan basis ÛÒ wants to put the full weight of the legislative branch behind NATOÛ Stavridis said. ÛÏWe will never find a better pool of allies in the world than the Europeans and this address underscores the importance of the trans-Atlantic bridge which has been creaking a bit lately.ÛTrumpÛªs criticisms are not NATOÛªs only source of friction. The alliance also is at odds with long-time member Turkey over its planned purchase of a Russian air defense system that is not compatible with the allied air defenses. The Trump administration is threatening to stop delivery to Turkey of the newest U.S. fighter jet the F-35 if the Turks go through with their plan to buy RussiaÛªs advanced S-400 system instead of the American Patriot system.Escalating that fight Vice President Mike Pence scolded Turkey at a NATO 70th anniversary event following StoltenbergÛªs speech. He said the Russian S-400 system ÛÏposes great danger to NATOÛ and suggested that Turkey needs to decide between NATO and Russia.ÛÏTurkey must chooseÛ he said. ÛÏDoes it want to remain a critical partner of the most successful military alliance in the history of the world or does it want to risk the security of that partnership by making reckless decisions that undermine our alliance?ÛStoltenberg made a point of highlighting the benefits to the United States of having NATO allies. He noted for example that in response to the attacks of Sept. 11 2001 NATO invoked Article 5 of its founding charter to come to the aid of a member under attack. He said allies also provide the U.S. with valuable military support in peacetime from tracking submarines in the Arctic to providing bases in Europe from which the U.S. can project power.ÛÏOur alliance has not lasted for 70 years out of a sense of nostalgia or of sentimentÛ he said. ÛÏNATO lasts because it is in the national interest of each and every one of our countries.ÛStoltenberg on Thursday will lead a meeting of NATO foreign ministers hosted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to mark 70 years since the allianceÛªs founding charter the North Atlantic Treaty. The alliance has grown from its original 12 members to 29 with the Republic of North Macedonia about to become the 30th member country.Stoltenberg a two-time former prime minister of Norway is the first head of NATO to address a joint meeting of Congress. He touted the allianceÛªs long record of partnership but also noted it has a history of coping with internal divisions including strong opposition by France Germany and other members to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.ÛÏOpen discussions and different views is not a sign of weaknessÛ he said. ÛÏIt is a sign of strength. So we should not be surprised when we see differences between our countries. Today there are disagreements on issues such as trade energy climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. These are serious issues with serious disagreements.ÛTrump has sharply criticized other NATO members including Germany for not meeting spending targets. On Tuesday he praised the generally upward trend among the European allies but hounded them to pay even more because he believes America still shoulders a disproportionate share of the cost of protecting Europe.In a meeting at the White House Trump and Stoltenberg had kind words for each other. But in the past Trump has called NATO ÛÏobsoleteÛ and suggested he might pull the U.S. out of the alliance if member nations didnÛªt significantly boost defense spending.ÛÏWeÛªve worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair shareÛ Trump told reporters. ÛÏAt some point itÛªs going to have to go higher.ÛTrump took credit for the increased spending. However spending by NATO countries which dropped after the end of the Cold War has actually been rising since 2014 before Trump took office .After RussiaÛªs 2014 annexation of UkraineÛªs Crimean Peninsula member countries agreed to boost defense budgets and ÛÏmove towardÛ spending 2% of their gross domestic products on defense by 2024. The U.S. spends about 3.4% of its GDP on defense.Since Trump took office European allies and Canada have added $41 billion to their defense budgets. By the end of next year this is scheduled to reach $100 billion Stoltenberg said. Germany remains the main target of TrumpÛªs ire because it plans to spend 1.5% below the 2% guideline by 2024.Stoltenberg has said the 2% guideline was not invented by the United States and was a target the 29 allies set in 2014.ÛÏThe allies are really stepping upÛ Stoltenberg said in an interview with The Associated Press.Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann and Susannah George in Washington and Lorne Cook in Brussels contributed to this report.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Check out this story on detroitnews.com: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/08/nielsen-says-still-supports-trumps-border-goals/39317129/A link has been sent to your friend's email address.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.To find out more about Facebook commenting please read theNielsen says she still supports TrumpÛªs border goalColleen Long and Zeke Miller Associated PresÛÒ Kirstjen Nielsen said Monday she still shares President Donald TrumpÛªs goal of securing the border a day after she resigned as Homeland Security secretary amid TrumpÛªs frustration and bitterness over a spike in Central American migration.Trump announced on Sunday in a tweet that U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department. The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects TrumpÛªs priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.Nielsen had traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed TrumpÛªs comments on the situation at the border though she ducked out of the room while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers Nielsen was at TrumpÛªs side introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.But on Sunday she wrote in her resignation letter that ÛÏit is the right time for me to step aside.Û She wrote that she hoped ÛÏthe next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure AmericaÛªs borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationÛªs discourse.ÛNielsen told reporters outside her Alexandria Virginia home Monday that she continues to support the presidentÛªs goal of securing the border.ÛÏI will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the borderÛ she said in her first public remarks since the surprise resignation thanking the president ÛÏfor the tremendous opportunity to serve this country.ÛNielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether sheÛªd be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning though she was not forced to do so they said.Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination of another key immigration official the development Sunday was unexpected.Still it was unclear how McAleenan would immediately assume the role. The agencyÛªs undersecretary of management Claire Grady is technically next in line for the job and she will need to resign ÛÒ or more likely be fired ÛÒ in order for McAleenan to assume the post.ÛÏThe president works very well with Kevin McAleenan. HeÛªs done an incredible job in the administration and we expect that relationship and the work to continueÛ White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters Monday.He cited McAleenanÛªs ÛÏextensiveÛ knowledge of immigration issues and said the change in leadership would hopefully lead to ÛÏmassive changesÛ at the border.Nielsen is the latest person felled in the Trump administrationÛªs unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials brought about by the presidentÛªs mercurial management style insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.She was also the highest profile female Cabinet member and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and even the White House staff without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary Jim Mattis was pushed out in December over criticism of the presidentÛªs Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January following John KellyÛªs resignation last year.McAleenan has helped shape many of the administrationÛªs policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders the White House and Homeland Security officials. But itÛªs unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.Rep. Joaquin Castro chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus was critical of Nielsen saying she spent her tenure ÛÏchampioning President TrumpÛªs cruel anti-immigrant agendaÛ and he called McAleenanÛªs appointment ÛÏdeeply disturbing.ÛÛÏHe cannot be trusted as Acting DHS Secretary based on his record of prioritizing TrumpÛªs harmful policies that undermine national security and the economy and hurt vulnerable families and children at the borderÛ Castro a Texas Democrat said in a statement.Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary after her predecessor Kelly became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.Once Kelly left the White House NielsenÛªs days appeared to be numbered and she had expected to be pushed out last November.During the government shutdown over TrumpÛªs insistence for funding for a border wall NielsenÛªs standing inside the White House appeared to rise. But in recent weeks as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign tensions flared anew.The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello ÛÒ a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller an immigration hardliner and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views the people said.Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday but when there was no time she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March more than half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers ÛÒ scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday ÛÒ was postponed.Nielsen dutifully pushed TrumpÛªs immigration policies including funding for his border wall and defended the administrationÛªs practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens ÛÏin the United States every day.Û But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.Under Nielsen migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for 12000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3000 families and facilities are at capacity.Nielsen also advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online ÛÒ not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2018 election.She led the federal agency since December 2017 and was this administrationÛªs third Homeland Security secretary. A protege of KellyÛªs he brought her to the White House after Trump named him chief of staff.Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.This story corrects the month in which border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry to March not this month.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

The Associated Press reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help to deal with the growing number of families crossing the border.But administration officials told Fox News on Sunday that NielsenÛªs background in cybersecurity made her a poor fit to handle border issues while McAleenan best fits TrumpÛªs requirement of being the ÛÏtoughest copÛ on the frontier.

President Donald Trump is visiting Calexico on Friday April 5 2019 to tour the recently-built portion of the border fence that bears a silver plaque with his name on it.(Photo: Gregory Bull / AP file)ÛÒ The White House has touted a two-mile stretch of fencing President Donald Trump is visiting Friday as the first section of his proposed border wall to be built.In reality the newly fortified structure commemorated with a plaque bearing his name and those of top immigration and homeland security officials was a long-planned replacement for an old barrier.It is one of a handful of projects that total $1 billion to replace existing barriers and build new ones across the border.As Trump touts his signature campaign promise as the solution to the recent surge of migrant families crossing the border here are questions and answers about the various barriers along the border and those that are in the works.The southern border is nearly 2000 miles long and already has about 650 miles of different types of barriers including short vehicle barricades and tall steel fences that go up to 30 feet high. Most of the fencing was built during the administration of George W. Bush and there have been updates and maintenance throughout other administrations.Trump has yet to complete any new mileage of fencing or other barriers anywhere on the border. His administration has only replaced existing fencing including the section he is touring Friday.Construction for that small chunk of fencing cost about $18 million began in February 2018 and was completed in October. Plans to replace that fence date back to 2009 during the beginning of former President Barack ObamaÛªs tenure.Contractors have been doing site and preparation work for 13 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley that will be TrumpÛªs first new fencing. The administration said construction could begin as early as this week. The administration is also in the process of replacing 14 miles of fencing around San Diego.ÛÏThe wall is under construction by the way large sections. WeÛªre going to be meeting I think on Friday at a piece of the wall that weÛªve completed a big piece a lot of itÛªs being built right nowÛ he told reporters Thursday. ÛÏItÛªs moving along very nicely. But we need the wall.ÛIn this Feb. 5 2019 file photo a Border Patrol agent walks towards prototypes for a border wall in San Diego. The prototypes were taken down in February.(Photo: Gregory Bull / AP file)Early in his term Trump called for prototypes of border walls that were built in the San Diego area at a cost of about $300000 to $500000 each. Eight prototypes went up and Trump traveled to the border to inspect them last year.But they were demolished in February. The nearly $3 billion that Congress provided for barriers during the first half of TrumpÛªs term requires the money be spent on designs that were in place before May 2017 which meant the prototypes couldnÛªt be used.The prototypes became a spectacle at various times since Trump took office drawing tourists protesters and artists who projected light shows on the walls from Mexico.What about the national emergency?Trump shut down the federal government for more than a month ÛÒ the longest shutdown in U.S. history ÛÒ and later declared a national emergency to free up billions of dollars to build his wall. Congress had voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed the measure.Several organizations brought lawsuits over the declaration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats also planned on suing to prevent Trump from ÛÏstealingÛ money from federal programs and diverting the money to build a wall.But the national emergency money has not yet been spent in part because the government has to first spend existing border wall funding. A lawsuit could eventually derail the plan.Still various plans for more border barriers are moving along.In this Jan. 22 2019 file photo workers place sections of metal wall as a new barrier is built along the Texas-Mexico border near downtown El Paso.(Photo: Eric Gay / AP file)Last month the Department of Homeland Security requested that the defense department build 57 miles of 18-foot fencing near Yuma Arizona and El Paso Texas which have seen enormous increases in the number of border crossers especially families.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/05/look-state-wall-us-mexico-border/39304821/,0

In the immediate aftermath HarperÛªs Country Hams of Clinton Kentucky was one of the first to step in offering to take over EdwardsÛª production until the company got back on its feet in their Surry Virginia home base. Almost exactly a year later the unthinkable happened again: HarperÛªs plant caught fire too and both familiesÛª inventories were lost.åÊEven in the face of that kind of devastation Edwards hasnÛªt wavered in his determination to restore his historic operation to its former glory.ÛFlag on the play? -with your tips comments or questions.Change from one week ago:Average includes: NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 53% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 41% approve - 55% disapprove; NPR/PBS/Marist: 44% approve - 50% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 55% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 51% disapprovBETO CALLS BIBI A RACISTon Sunday described Israeli Prime Ministeras a Û÷racistÛª whose outreach to far-right interests as he seeks to hang onto political power has seriously damaged the chances of peace in the Middle East. Speaking at a town hall here at the University of Iowa the former Texas congressman denounced NetanyahuÛªs pledge Saturday that he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term in TuesdayÛªs Israeli general election. NetanyahuÛªs proposed annexation OÛªRourke said Û÷will make peace in the long term impossible.Ûª In response to a voterÛªs question about his policy toward Israel and Palestinian rights OÛªRourke reiterated his support for a two-state solution and accused Netanyahu of having Û÷joined forces with far-right parties who are inherently racist in their speech and the way that they want to treat their fellow human beings in that part of the world.ÛªÛÛÏYet by the time he left the state on Sunday it was also clear that the euphoria that greeted [Beto] RourkeÛªs entry into the race three weeks earlier has started to subside. The inevitable slog of competing in a packed Democratic primary is underway and OÛªRourke has not yet drawn the wave of national adulation from the left that his Senate run againstlast year received. Û÷HeÛªs going to have to do the workÛª said an Iowa Democratic National Committee member and a former state party chairman. Û÷And it isnÛªt all breathless 300-person crowds.Ûª Û_ OÛªRourke has seen little movement in polls since he announced. Û_ And while OÛªRourke sprinted from college campuses and coffee shops to house parties across Iowa a more established contender Bernie Sanders was drawing even larger audiences here.BUTTIGIEG SHARES THE STRUGGLE BEHIND HIS COMING OUTmay not become president or win the Democratic primary but he&amp;apos;s already broken a barrier by delving publicly and intimately into his struggle with his own sexuality in a way no other serious presidential candidate has. In a speech before an audience of LGBT rights supporters on Sunday the mayor of South Bend Indiana did not describe being gay as something he always believed was acceptable. Nor did he dismiss lingering questions about his viability as a presidential candidate in a country in which three in 10 adults still say they have some reservations or would be very uncomfortable with a gay candidate according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in February. Instead he described wrestling with his sexual orientation as Û÷a kind of warÛª ÛÓ one he said he was only able to win when he came home from serving in Afghanistan.ÛBERNIE WARMS TO THE FRONTRUNNER ROLEis quieting critics who questioned whether he could recapture the energy of his upstart 2016 campaign surpassing his rivals in early fundraising and establishing himself as an indisputable front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Less than two months into his second White House bid no other declared candidate in the crowded Democratic field currently has amassed so many advantages: a $28 million war chest a loyal and enthusiastic voter base and a set of clearly defined policy objectives.åÊThat puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns which he has not yet released.ÛBernie wants felons to vote while still in prison -ÛÏSen. Bernie Sanders has long fought to restore voting rights for felons whoÛªve completed their prison sentences. Now the presidential candidate wants to go a big step further ÛÒ arguing that those currently behind bars should be able to vote too. Asked on the campaign trail in Muscatine Iowa on Saturday if those imprisoned should have the right to vote the independent senator from Vermont whoÛªs making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination answered: Û÷I think that is absolutely the direction we should go.Ûª Û÷In my state what we do is separate. YouÛªre paying a price you committed a crime youÛªre in jail. That&amp;apos;s badÛª Sanders explained. Û÷But youÛªre still living in American society and you have a right to vote. I believe in that yes I do.ÛªÛhas raised more than $5 million in the two months since he announced his 2020 plans the presidential candidateÛªs campaign said Sunday. BookerÛªs haul while competitive puts him behind other Democratic White House aspirants including former Texas congressmanåÊBeto OÛªRourke Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Sen.(Calif.) and South Bend Ind. MayoråÊPete Buttigieg. BookerÛªs campaign said 82 percent of the donors gave to the senator for the first time and the average online contribution was $34. The New Jersey Democrat who was first elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election raised $17.7 million to win a full term one year later.ÛBennet says nothing funny about Biden touchy contretemps -on Sunday criticized former Vice Presidentfor joking about the controversy swirling around his touchy avuncular style that some women say made them uncomfortable. Û÷I don&amp;apos;t think anyone should make jokes about itÛª the Colorado senator told CNN&amp;apos;son Û÷State of the Union.Ûª Û÷This is an important time in our country&amp;apos;s history when women are coming forward and able to say when they&amp;apos;ve been made to feel uncomfortable whether in a sexual way or a nonsexual way. People&amp;apos;s voices should be heard on that.Ûª Û_ On whether the controversy should disqualify Biden from another presidential bid Bennet said that would be up to voters to decide.ÛElizabeth Weil: Û÷Kamala Harris takes her shotÛªåÊ-ÛÏShe delivers her talking points while dressed as she always is in her uniform of dark suit pearls black heels. I knowÛÓyou think I shouldnÛªt be writing about her clothes. But the clothes themselves are a smart cautious play one that frankly could have benefited from. If you wear the same outfit every single day pretty soon the haters will run out of snarky things to say about your appearance and move on.ÛMULVANEY: VOTERS WILL Û÷NEVERÛª SEE TRUMPÛªS TAXESÛÏActing White House Chief of Stafftold Û÷Fox News SundayÛª in an exclusive interview that Democrats will Û÷neverÛª see&amp;apos;s tax returns days after a House Democrat committee chairmanåÊmade the unprecedented demandåÊthat the IRS provide the documents. Mulvaney&amp;apos;s comments marked an apparentåÊescalation in the White House&amp;apos;s rhetoric on the issue. On Wednesday Trump responded with aåÊdismissive tauntåÊto Democrats&amp;apos; renewed push for his tax information butåÊsuggested he might be willing to provide the information pending the conclusion of an audit. Û÷Oh no never -- nor should theyÛª Mulvaney told who is filling in for host when asked if Democrats will ever see the president&amp;apos;s tax returns.åÊÛ÷ThatÛªs an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didnÛªt and they elected him anyway.ÛªÛRepublicans ready to spend big on Jewish voters -ÛÏRepublicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic PartyÛªs decades long stranglehold on the Jewish vote. Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP mega donor. Û_ The investment people familiar with the early discussions said will far surpass what the group spent in past presidential elections. With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump ÛÓ who has himself faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism ÛÓ as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.ÛHouse freshmen Dems raising big numbers alreadyGOP senators slated to tackle health care take a pasBarr to face questions this week from Hill committees on Muller releasHouse Dems look to resolve months long fight over disaster fundfrom USA Today about how her fellow House Democrats say the stack of San Francisco Giants baseball bats in her office symbolize her propensity for knocking heads.Ed. note: On Feb. 20 1992 during an appearance onÛªs television show ÛÒ where else? ÛÒ Perot issued a challenge to his supporters: If they could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states he would run for president. This was also a challenge to the people working for him at his United We Stand group which I assume includes your friend. They completed their work seven months later a pretty impressive clip especially at a time where ballot access was more restrictive and without the technology to organize that we have today. Unfortunately for them Perot had already spectacularly bizarrely dropped out of the race that summer before ever officially entering it. But when supporters delivered on the 50-state promise Perot belatedly jumped in and still ended up with nearly 20 percent of the vote. I think that if Schultz were to put in the hundreds of millions of dollars he has discussed and make a decision on his current timetable of sometime this summer I would think he would have ample time to make the ballot in all 50 states. Whether there would be enough people who cared about that in order to make it consequential is another matterÛ_Ed. note: But they do vote Mr. Steinen. That would be like asking only military members what they think of foreign policy or only women what the laws on abortion should be. And as Republicans deride an appetite for socialism and high taxation among Democratic candidates conservatives would do well to remember that such things as those are actually quite popular and not just among the nearly half of adults who donÛªt pay federal income taxes. ItÛªs not enough to scofand please make sure to include your name and hometown.ÛÏA Visalia man has gotten pretty used to getting weird looks on the streets as he drives around a jet ski on dry land.says he put a jet ski&amp;apos;s body right onto a scooter.

And now that Stemple has his own Scootski he&amp;apos;s never going back. Û÷I love this thing! I&amp;apos;ve gotten rid of my other motorcycles. I ride this every single dayÛª said Stemple. Stemple says he got a Honda Elite off Craig&amp;apos;s List. His friend had the jet ski.

"Please Reconsider Mr. President | RealClearPoliticVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In 2017 speaking to a group of leaders from Central America Vice President Mike Pence declared ""To further stem the flow of illegal immigration and illegal drugs into the United States President Trump knows as do all of you that we must confront these problems at their source. We must meet them -- and we must solve them -- in Central and South America."" What Pence said then was correct. What President Donald Trump is doing now -- cutting aid -- needs to be reconsidered.Fifteen years ago Colombia was on the verge of collapse. The nation was overrun with drug traffickers cartels and local gangs. Crime and violence were rampant and people were fleeing the nation. The United States deployed its foreign aid budget and military resources to help the Colombian government stabilize fight its domestic drug war and beat the cartels. The nation went from the brink to being a stable leader in South America and a strategic ally of the United States. In the past decade trade with Colombia has tripled to $14 billion benefiting American businesses.Since 2016 American assistance to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador has declined 20%. Concurrent with that decline in American assistance those countries have seen an increase in domestic crime corruption and flight of refugees headed toward the United States.According to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition ""in neighborhoods where USAID operates in El Salvador and Honduras homicide rates have plummeted by up to 78%."" Likewise ""for every 10 additional murders in Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala 6 additional children sought safety in the United States.""Notably the Trump administration itself claims El Salvador has used our aid to stem the tide of illegal immigrants headed to the border. The Washington Post's Kevin Sieff wrote last week about remarks made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan: ""'What (El Salvador is) doing is working both on the security front and on the economic opportunity front' ... McAleenan speaking last year at the Bipartisan Policy Center described El Salvador as a model: 'We want to achieve those same successes in Honduras and Guatemala as well.'""The last time the United States worked in concert with Central American countries to fund internal projects related to fighting crime corruption and abuse those governments committed 10 times as many resources and with our dollars and direction saw crime and population flight decrease. In 2017 we spent $420 million in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador to help. Those countries combined spent $5.4 billion of their own resources but let the U.S. take the lead in a partnership that benefited us all.As former White House Chief of Staff and Southcom Gen. John Kelly has noted ""If we can improve the conditions the lot in life of Hondurans Guatemalans Central Americans we can do an awful lot to protect the southwest border.""I used to believe we should cut foreign aid from our budget. But I have realized we can spend far less in these countries helping stabilize situations than we could on the border wall a project I support. If we just build a wall we are going to see an increase in violence drug trafficking and nation-state collapse. Those problems will eventually penetrate our border with or without a wall. Right now cutting off funding and having no wall will thoroughly destabilize the situation. On top of that these countries are in many cases desperate. By ignoring them we are seeding the ground for China to lay down roots in the Western Hemisphere as it and Russia have tried to do in places such as Venezuela.We risk undermining our long-term national interests by cutting this foreign aid. We should instead spend it wisely in those countries to ensure stable governments that view us as allies and work with them to root out crime corruption and cartels. The present policy to cut foreign aid cuts off our national nose to spite our face.Erick Erickson is editor of TheResurgent.com.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

But talking to reporters after addressing members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Biden said he was proud of his own early support for gay marriage and other liberal stands.ÛÏThe vast majority of the members of the Democratic party are still basically liberal to moderate Democrats in the traditional senseÛ Biden said. As to where he falls on ideological lines Biden added: ÛÏIÛªm an Obama-Biden Democrat man. And IÛªm proud of it.ÛStill signs of shifts in feelings in the party have been evident in recent complaints about BidenÛªs history of publicly affectionate behavior with women. Nevada politician Lucy Flores said she was uncomfortable when Biden kissed her on the back of the head backstage at a 2014 campaign event. Her account was countered by scores of women ÛÒ from prominent lawmakers to former staffers ÛÒ who praised him as a warm affectionate person and a supportive boss. But several other women have also come forward to recount their own awkward interactions with him.Biden kicked off his speech making light of the controversy after embracing the IBEWÛªs male president Lonnie Stephenson. ÛÏI just want you to know I had permission to hug LonnieÛ Biden joked to the largely male audience which responded with cheers.Afterward he spoke with reporters about the recent controversy.ÛÏIÛªm sorry I didnÛªt understand more. IÛªm not sorry for any of my intentions. IÛªm not sorry for anything IÛªve ever done ÛÒ IÛªve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman.ÛFlores wasnÛªt impressed. She tweeted: ÛÏTo make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have.ÛFormer Vice President Joe Biden is greeted by International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers President Lonnie Stephenson as he arrives to speak at IBEW's construction and maintenance conference in Washington Friday April 5 2019.(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP)Biden did say the controversy ÛÏis going to have to change somewhat how I campaign.Û Though he hasnÛªt formally announced Biden on Friday made clear heÛªs expecting to run again for president saying lawyers warned him he needs to speak carefully about his intentions but that he expects to ÛÏbe standing before you all relatively soon.ÛBidenÛªs address seemed intended to highlight how he could win back white blue-collar workers like those who supported Donald Trump in 2016. Biden seemed to criticize his own party for walking away from the demographic in a nostalgia-drenched 40-minute address.Biden recounted a time when he said the dignity of teachers sanitation and electrical line workers was treasured and the nation felt it had a common purpose. Saying his father a salesman told him to respect everyone Biden alluded to various ÛÏsophisticated friendsÛ who donÛªt get the significance of treating blue-collar laborers as equals.ÛÏAll youÛªre looking for is to be treated fairly with respect with some dignityÛ Biden said. ÛÏBecause you matter.ÛBiden also noted heÛªd gotten criticism from the left for saying Democrats had to work with Republicans to get things done and in defending President ObamaÛªs signature law the Affordable Care Act which some Democratic presidential aspirants want to replace with a single-payer system.ÛÏWe need to build on itÛ Biden said of the law. ÛÏWhat we canÛªt do is blow it up.ÛShortly after Biden was finished speaking Trump hit back. ÛÏIÛªve employed thousands of Electrical WorkersÛ the president tweeted as his plane flew toward the Mexican border with California. ÛÏThey will be voting for me!ÛThe IBEW endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.Friday was the second time in two days the president attacked Biden on Twitter. Despite more than a dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct on Thursday the president posted a doctored version of a cellphone video Biden released addressing the controversy over his touching. In TrumpÛªs version a Biden avatar approaches Biden from behind and appears to grab his shoulders.Trump has denied the allegations of sexual misconduct and on Friday he told reporters he saw no reason to avoid going after Biden on the issue. ÛÏYeah I think IÛªm a very good messenger and people got a kick out of itÛ Trump said.Riccardi reported from Denver.

Senate GOP Game Plan Means More Trump Nominees Fewer Bills | RealClearPoliticSenate GOP Game Plan Means More Trump Nominees Fewer BillSenate GOP Game Plan Means More Trump Nominees Fewer BillSenate GOP Game Plan Means More Trump Nominees Fewer BillVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON (AP) ÛÓ Mitch McConnell says the Senate will be in the ÛÏpersonnel businessÛ this year. But the majority leaderÛªs focus on confirming President Donald TrumpÛªs nominees is coming at the expense of any big legislative priorities.Nearly 100 days into the new Congress the drive to confirm is adding more conservatives to the courts and putting more Trump appointees in government offices. But TrumpÛªs promises to replace the Affordable Care Act invest in infrastructure or cut middle class taxes have been essentially shelved.The result is that the GOP-controlled Senate is on a very different path heading into the 2020 election than is the House where the Democratic majority is churning out a long list of bills on ethics gun violence and other topics that while unlikely to become law show voters their priorities.Sara Binder an expert on Congress at George Washington University said there doesnÛªt seem to be much room in the Senate ÛÏto set out a policy agenda and make some progress toward it.Û She added: ÛÏIt does leave on the table quite a number of issues that donÛªt get any progress.ÛUnderlying his strategy McConnell R-Ky. engineered a rules change last week to speed the confirmation process pushing past DemocratsÛª stalling of TrumpÛªs picks for administration jobs and district courts.ÛÏLook we know you donÛªt like Donald Trump but there was an electionÛ McConnell argued on the Senate floor to the Democrats saying the president ÛÏis at least entitled to set up the administration and make it function.ÛDemocratic senators see a much more deliberative strategy. Rather than try to work with Democrats ÛÓ and Trump ÛÓ to pass bills that can be turned into law they say McConnell is simply blocking bills from the House while spending his time packing the courts with conservatives judges as part of a broader legacy of reshaping the judiciary.Already McConnell spent the first two years of the administration confirming a record 30 circuit court nominees. With seven more confirmed this year heÛªs now turning to the district courts; four nominees already are teed up for Senate action.ÛÏWhat Leader McConnell President Trump and Republicans in the Senate are trying to do is use the courts to adopt the far-right agenda that Republicans know they cannot enact through the legislative processÛ Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said during the floor debate.In an earlier time McConnell was an advocate of capitalizing on divided government to foster deal-making. Compromises between Democrats and Republicans ended a budget crisis during President Barack ObamaÛªs administration and produced bills on other education and topics.But so far this year the big-ticket items have been elusive. Trump wanted GOP senators to try again to replace ObamaÛªs health care law but without a substantive plan McConnell quashed that effort until after the 2020 election.Republicans are quick to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. saying thereÛªs almost nothing Senate Republicans and House Democrats can agree on. As if to prove the point McConnell forced the Senate into a vote on the Green New Deal from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey D-Mass. highlighting Democratic tensions with the liberal flank of their party.Yet itÛªs clear that Republicans have had their own difficulty with Trump whose shifting positions have left them without fully shared policy priorities. For example many Republicans oppose TrumpÛªs tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations. One major bill that did pass the Senate rebuked TrumpÛªs plan to withdraw troops from Syria.Trump opposed two substantive measures that cleared both chambers of Congress. He vetoed one that went against his national emergency to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall and has threatened to veto another thatÛªs opposing U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen.ÛÏIf youÛªre talking about a big bold vision yea IÛªd like to do entitlement reform IÛªd like to do tax reform 2.0 ÛÓ there are a whole bunch of things on the economic agenda that I think we can do but those things arenÛªt going to move in a Democrat HouseÛ said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota the second-ranking Republican.ÛÏItÛªs just hard right nowÛ he said. ÛÏIn terms of legislative expectations I think weÛªre being realistic and not setting the bar too high but there are some things that I think can get done.ÛOne of the only jobs McConnell ever wanted was in the Senate he says in his biography ÛÏThe Long Game.Û But after more 30 years in office the majority leader often seen as an institutionalist is steadily changing the way the chamber operates.In many ways heÛªs simply building on the moves made by a predecessor Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada who used the ÛÏnuclear optionÛ to change the rules to more easily approve ObamaÛªs Cabinet officials and most judges with a majority rather than the 60-vote threshold in the 100-member Senate.McConnell took it further going ÛÏnuclearÛ to usher through TrumpÛªs Supreme Court nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and again with last weekÛªs changes that slashed debate time on most nominees from 30 hours to two.Some say itÛªs only a matter of time before the legislative filibuster which sets a 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation becomes the next to fall.Not everyone opposes such changes. On Friday presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. speaking at the National Action Network said if Democrats take control they should end the filibuster. She cited the filibusterÛªs role in stopping anti-lynching and civil rights legislation.Even some Democrats see the hours of idle debate on lower-level picks as a waste of time.ÛÏOur obligation as senators is not to try to revive the old Senate but rather to figure out how we can build a new Senate that has its own customs and rules and institutional perogative that will work in a modern eraÛ said Sen. Brian Schatz D-Hawaii.But for now the Senate has a singular focus.Sen. John Cornyn R-Texas who faces re-election next year isnÛªt sure confirmations will be enough for voters. But in divided Washington he sees few other options.ÛÏThe personnel business may be the whole gameÛ he said.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

Scott Applewhite / AP)ÛÒ The House Judiciary Committee approved subpoenas Wednesday for special counsel Robert MuellerÛªs full Russia report as Democrats pressure the Justice Department to release the document without redactions.The committee voted 24-17 to give Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. permission to issue subpoenas to the Justice Department for the final report its exhibits and any underlying evidence or materials prepared for MuellerÛªs investigation. Nadler has not yet said if heÛªll send the subpoenas.House Democrats had given Attorney General William Barr until Tuesday to provide the full report to Congress. The Justice Department ignored that deadline with Barr telling committee chairmen in a letter last week that a redacted version of the almost 400-page report would be released by mid-April ÛÏif not sooner.ÛThe vote further escalates the DemocratsÛª battle with the Justice Department over how much of the report they will be able to see a fight that could eventually end up in court if the two sides canÛªt settle their differences through negotiation. Democrats have said they will not accept redactions and want to see the evidence unfiltered by Barr.In the letter last week Barr said he is scrubbing the report to avoid disclosing any grand jury information or classified material in addition to portions of the report that pertain to ongoing investigations or that ÛÏwould unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.ÛDemocrats say they want access to all of that information even if some of it canÛªt be disclosed to the public. Nadler said he will give Barr time to change his mind on redactions but if they cannot reach an agreement they will issue the subpoenas ÛÏin very short order.Û He also said he is prepared to go to court to get the grand jury information.ÛÏThis committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job not the attorney generalÛªs to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his officeÛ Nadler said.The Judiciary panel also voted Wednesday to authorize subpoenas related to five of President Donald TrumpÛªs former top advisers including strategist Steve Bannon communications director Hope Hicks chief of staff Reince Priebus White House counsel Donald McGahn and counsel Ann Donaldson. Donaldson served as McGahnÛªs chief of staff before both left the administration.The five were key witnesses in MuellerÛªs probe of possible obstruction of justice and were sent document requests by the Judiciary panel last month along with dozens of other people connected to Trump. Nadler said he is concerned about reports that documents relevant to MuellerÛªs investigation ÛÏwere sent outside the White HouseÛ meaning the committee should have access to them because they may not be covered by executive privilege.The top Republican on the Judiciary panel Georgia Rep. Doug Collins said at the vote that the five subpoenas are misguided because two of the individuals have already provided 3000 documents to the committee and that the other three have indicated a willingness to cooperate.Collins said the authorization for subpoenas is ÛÏrecklessÛ and that Democrats shouldnÛªt be asking for documents that the Justice Department canÛªt legally disclose to the public. The committee rejected a GOP amendment that would have blocked the subpoenas from applying to grand jury information.ÛÏWe have a pre-emptive chairman who has gone out with pre-emptive subpoenas today on a report that has already been promised himÛ Collins said. ÛÏThis is nothing but political theater.ÛTrump himself has largely deferred to Barr on the reportÛªs release while also saying he wouldnÛªt mind if the full version was made public. Still he has criticized Democrats for seeking the unredacted information. He tweeted Tuesday that ÛÏthere is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfyÛ Nadler or House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff who has also called for the full release.In a four-page summary of MuellerÛªs report on March 24 Barr wrote that the special counsel did not find that TrumpÛªs campaign ÛÏconspired or coordinatedÛ with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election. He also said Mueller reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the federal investigation instead setting out ÛÏevidence on both sidesÛ of the question.Barr himself went further than Mueller in his summary letter declaring that MuellerÛªs evidence was insufficient to prove in court that Trump had committed obstruction of justice to hamper the probe.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/congress-russia-probe/39293119/,0

At the end of each week I provide a historical quote (or two or three) and todayÛªs come courtesy of Booker T. Washington born on this date in 1856 and an educator who founded Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute now Tuskegee University.Many years before the civil rights movement gained traction in post-World War II America Booker T. WashingtonÛªs ideas for black empowerment had been eclipsed. In some ways it happened in his own lifetime. His focus on educating formerly enslaved blacks and their children in what was known then as the ÛÏindustrial artsÛ was challenged by W.E.B. Du Bois who accused Washington of minimizing the intellectual ambitions of African Americans.By 1919 only four years after Booker T. WashingtonÛªs death followers of radical separatist leader Marcus Garvey were denouncing the ÛÏUncle TomÛ ideas of accommodationists such as Washington. Fair enough although if weÛªve learned anything in the ensuing 100 years itÛªs that the world needs vocational education -- today we might call them software coders -- in addition to intellectuals. Anyway Booker T. Washington said and wrote many other things with current resonance.ÛÏI think I have learnedÛ he wrote in his memoir ÛÏthat the best way to lift oneÛªs self up is to help someone else.ÛIn a 1909 speech about Abraham Lincoln to the Republican Club of New York City he expounded on this idea. ÛÏOf all forms ofthere is none that is so harmful and degrading as that form of slavery which tempts onebeing to hate another by reason of his race or colorÛ he said.åÊÛÏOne man cannot hold another man down in the ditch without remaining down in the ditch with him.ÛThose are mere warmup pitches however. In a moment IÛªll have this FridayÛªs Quote of the Week.

Washington was born on April 5 1856. In truth Washington never knew for sure the date -- or even the year -- of his birth. In itsof the man the New York Times thought 1858 was a more likely year. He never knew his father either. But this is the date on which Washington celebrated his birth and when we think of the intellectual and momentous debates that took place in black American intellectual life after the Civil War it behooves us to exhibit some grace to all those men and women who were determined to forge a way forward that would make life better for themselves and their descendants.Booker T. Washington paid homage to this idea himself in an introduction he wrote to a 1902 book called ÛÏÛ co-authored by two scholars one white one black. In the passage that follows from that introduction -- and this is my quote of the week -- please note that Washington uses the word ÛÏwithes.Û This is not a typo that was meant to be ÛÏwhites.Û A ÛÏwitheÛ is a now-obscure word that originally meant a tough vine as from a willow. In this context it means rope.ÛÏThe unprecedented leap the Negro made when freed from the oppressing withes of bondage is more than deserving of a high place in historyÛ he wrote. ÛÏIt can never be chronicled.
