He held various positions in the agency from there including as a liaison to Congress the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Washington field office and the agent in charge of the agency's training center in Maryland.Alles said in an email to Secret Service employees obtained by CNN that his incoming successor ""is a consummate professional"" and that he was confident in Murray whom he referred to as the agency's assistant director of the office of protective operations.

Stunning I'd say.And the purge of the Department of Homeland Security leadership is equally remarkable.As for replacements for those no longer on Team Trump there seems to be a presidential preference for ""acting"" leaders no matter how crucial the jobs.Trump overseeing 'near-systematic purge' at Department of Homeland Security""I like acting because I can move so quickly"" Trump said in January. ""It gives me more flexibility.""It also gives him no controversial confirmation hearings — for jobs like secretary of defense homeland security and interior. Besides Trump likes to run things himself. So why put anyone who might disagree in a position of power? As someone who has known Trump for decades reminds me ""He never liked having anyone higher than the equivalent of a vice president"" in his own organization. Sure some folks had titles but as far as Trump was concerned ""that didn't matter. They knew who was the boss.""But the boss operates on his very own chaos theory. It's not new to Trump but its new to the Oval Office. And it's a disturbing -- even frightening -- way to govern. Trump's version of chaos according to this longtime associate ""has to do with his level of entertainment of himself. That means doing the opposite of what everyone suggests and then showing that I was right."" His instincts this source says ""are not well thought out or researched"" but he has ""found this place of doing the remarkable unexpected thing and at the end of the day sometimes he gets lucky.""In his mind at least.At the outset of the administration even Trump thought he needed to learn the ropes. So he hired an insider like former Republican Party boss Reince Priebus to be his chief of staff but that didn't last long. Trump doesn't like anyone else running things -- or even trying to run things. ""This is the voraciousness he has always had"" says this source. ""But there's no loyalty. If you ever need him you're finished...The minute you work for him it's over. He lured you in so he can crush you.""And that's exactly what he does. That's why there's no deep bench in Trumpworld just Trump a few folks he made rich and his family.Consider what became of his casinos in Atlantic City more specifically the Taj Mahal in 1990 -- the iconic demonstration of Trump dysfunction that has not changed in decades.""Donald always operated with a very thin group"" says Alan Lapidus Trump's architect adding there were about six people running the whole endeavor. When one-third of the slot machines were shut down because they didn't pass muster it was chaos. ""It was a breakdown of monumental proportions"" says Jack O'Donnell one of Trump's casino managers. And what did Trump do to try and solve the problem? He decided to ""shame and belittle and berate and to threaten to fire and demand firings in the midst of the chaos.""Gee does that sound familiar?Allow me to spell it out: Immigration policy and border security aren't going the way he wants and he decided to fire Kirstjen Nielsen the head of the Department of Homeland Security. CNN's reporting recounts that she dared to oppose the President's desire to possibly reinstate the family separation policy or listen to Trump ideas on denying asylum that were potentially illegal.Presidents are supposed to be islands of calm in the middle of chaos. Not this one; he is the chaos. When the Taj Mahal was at a breaking point says O'Donnell ""what the place needed was calm a clear thinker. And in the midst of chaos Donald Trump could not provide that in any way.""Because that's not how he rolls -- not now or in the past. ""Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something that no one ever expected him ever to say upend the entire meeting leave everybody agog...and control every situation that way. By the time he leaves the room ... he owns the store"" says former Trump Organization Vice President Louise Sunshine.Yep he owns the store. We are reminded of that every way with every whim with every flip flop on policy and personnel.  And if he succeeds with one whim or idea there's another that ""fuels the next absurdity"" as the source who has known Trump puts it. ""He continues to believe that he has proven he is immune to consequences.""Yet there is one thing about chaos theory: Instability and turbulence can backfire. And it's those unintended consequences that can get you. Especially when you're not paying much attention.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Klobuchar: Infrastructure is a 'bread and butter' issuKlobuchar: Infrastructure is a 'bread and butter' issuSen. Amy Klobuchar raised more than $5.2 million in the first seven weeks of her presidential bid the Minnesota Democrat's campaign announced Monday.Her fundraising haul appeared to edge her just past another senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Cory Booker who raised about $5 million. But Klobuchar now in her third Senate term ranks behind the early leaders in fundraising -- led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who collected $18.2 million during the first 41 days of his campaign and California Sen. Kamala Harris who raised $12 million in the first quarter.Klobuchar's fundraising also lagged behind that of former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke who entered the race more than a month after the Minnesotan and collected $9.4 million in just 18 days. He benefited from an enormous donor base built during his 2018 Senate bid. His strength as a small-dollar fundraiser helped him collect a record-smashing $80 million on his way to losing Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Klobuchar coasted to re-election in Minnesota last fall and ended her Senate campaign with more than $3 million in leftover funds. Those reserves helped her start April with $7 million remaining in the bank.Two other Democratic contenders have announced how much money they have remaining in their bank accounts: Sanders with $28 million and Booker with $6.1 million.The fundraising totals offer an early snapshot of the financial strength of candidates in the crowded field of Democrats vying to face President Donald Trump in the general election.Some of Klobuchar's fundraising has included higher-dollar events where she raised money for both the primary and general elections. Money raised for the general election would not be available to her until she received her party's nod. Her campaign's news release did not break out how much money specifically was raised for the primary.""Since that snowy day we launched in February the outpouring of support has been incredible"" Klobuchar said Monday on Twitter referring to her outdoor campaign announcement in the middle of a Minnesota snowstorm. She said her campaign had received donations from every state.With at least 17 contenders already declared and others waiting in the wings no Democratic candidate is posting record-breaking totals. Democrat Hillary Clinton for instance raised an eye-popping $47.5 million during her first quarter of the 2016 presidential race.Given the intense competition for the nomination in 2020 candidates' ability to draw in new small-dollar donors who can contribute repeatedly will be a key test of their staying power ahead of the Iowa caucuses which are nearly 10 months away.Klobuchar's aides said she attracted nearly 100000 online donors with an average online donation of $40. In addition 85% of all donors contributed less than $100 her campaign said.Klobuchar did not disclose how many people in total contributed to her campaign.In the news release her campaign aides said Klobuchar's bid would be ""homegrown"" and emphasized that she already has visited 10 states and met with ""thousands of voters"" in her fight for the nomination.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

And in an interview with USA Today the speaker of the House again turns her gaze to the most famous/infamous freshman House member in recent memory: New York's Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Asked about the difficulties of governing a caucus in the House that is being challenged at every turn by AOC and others like her -- liberals elected in the past few cycles who are deeply skeptical of the party establishment -- Pelosi said this: ""While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers what's important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House.""THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!In each episode of his weekly YouTube show Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!Now Pelosi didn't mention AOC by name. But you'd have to be a real dummy to not understand who she was talking about.Ocasio-Cortez has 3.9 million Twitter follower by far the most of any House member -- including Pelosi (). And AOC is an active Twitter user -- often employing the social media site to call out what she believes to be unfairness within the Democratic Party or to push back on media stories about her.Pelosi's not-so-subtle shot at AOC isn't an isolated event either. In Februaryshe was asked about the ""Green New Deal""a sweeping legislative proposal that Ocasio-Cortez has been closely aligned with that aims to address the challenges of climate change. ""It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive"" Pelosi said dismissively. ""The green dream or whatever they call it nobody knows what it is but they're for it right?""If you think Pelosi's comments on AOC are accidental and not meant to send a very clear message to AOC you don't know much about Pelosi. What message is she sending? This one:Look I have been a liberal's liberal for longer than you've been on earth. But not everyone House Democrat represents districts like we do. And we need to understand that they are governed by a different set of political realities. The most important thing we do isn't score ideological points. It's pass legislation as a united caucus --to show all Americans we are doing the work not just playing partisan games.Pelosi's comments come amid a broader showdown between the party establishment and the newly-energized liberal wing. The leading edge of that fight is a decision by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee the campaign arm of the partyto ban giving any business (aka money) to consultants who work for candidates who primary sitting incumbent. The goal is simple: The threat of losing business will keep top consultants away from primary challengers. That will theoretically mean fewer primary challengers. Which establishment Democrats -- led by DCCC Chair Rep. Cheri Bustos -- believe is a very good thing.AOC who herself ousted an incumbent to claim her seat in 2018took to Twitter to protesthe move. She called the policy ""extremely divisive &amp; harmful to the party"" and recommended that small-dollar donors ""pause"" on making contributions to the DCCC and instead focus on giving to vulnerable incumbents in swing seats.These fault lines within the House Democratic caucus are in some ways the natural result of winning the majority. The more seats you control the more likely it is that you have people from all over the ideological spectrum -- each of whom wants their way to beIt's also part of an even broader fight happening within the Democratic Party at the moment as activists and candidates navigate a post-Obama and post-Clinton landscape. At the presidential level you have Joe Biden the former vice president as the ur-establishment figure while Bernie Sanders -- and a number of other candidates -- are offering a more liberal outsider perspective.Pelosi for her part is matter-of-fact when it comes to the political realities facing the party -- and the challenges from liberals to move the center of gravity further to the left.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Lobbyist Sam Patten provided ""substantial assistance"" to special counsel Robert Mueller and several other ongoing investigations federal prosecutors said Monday paving the way for him to potentially avoid jail time at his sentencing this week.The case has been full of intrigue from the beginning givento several prongs of Mueller's investigation. He founded a company with a suspected Russian operative steered foreign money to President Donald Trump's inauguration was closely tied to Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and advised the controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica.Prosecutors from the US attorney's office in Washington didn't recommend a sentence for Patten who first came under investigation by Mueller's team. Heto illegally lobbying on behalf of a Ukrainian political party that favors closer relations with Russia.The prosecutors said Patten's cooperation was ""immediate"" and ""substantial."" They told the judge that Patten deserved leniency and formally requested a reduction in his sentence.""Patten has met with government investigators in person or by phone a total of nine separate times to answer numerous questions and explain various documents"" prosecutors wrote. ""In all of these sessions Patten has been honest and straightforward with government investigators.""But almost all of the details surrounding Patten's ""substantial"" assistance will remain secret for now. Both sides said they would submit additional filings under seal with that information.The court filings revealed that Patten provided evidence against Manafort and was prepared to testify against Manafort at trial. Prosecutors said Patten's experience as an overseas political constant made him a ""valuable resource for the government in a number of other criminal investigations providing helpful information about additional individuals and entities.""For his part Patten asked for probation instead of prison. His lawyers said he never intended to cover up anything related to Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. When he pleaded guilty Patten admitted that he illegally funneled money from a Russia-friendly oligarch to Trump's inauguration fund and that he lied about it to a congressional committee.""His crimes were not motivated by greed or a desire to conceal relevant information from the American public or to aid or cover up any potential interference with the 2016 Presidential election"" they wrote. ""To the contrary Mr. Patten's decisions in this case stemmed primarily from a desire to accommodate his clients' requests and to present himself in the best possible light after unexpectedly finding himself a subject of the Russian interference investigation.""That $50000 donation was a tiny fraction of the $107 million raised by Trump's inaugural fund. But federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkthat committee for a slew of potential crimes including fraud money laundering and conspiracy. It's not clear if Patten helped with that investigation whichThe contribution was not part of a broad effort to inject foreign funds into Trump's inauguration his lawyers said. Patten didn't even like Trump and opposed him in 2016 they added.""Mr. Patten did not support the Trump campaign and while he may have known people who worked for the campaign at various times he had no personal connection to it"" his lawyers wrote. ""Indeed Mr. Patten not only openly opposed the Trump candidacy but even broke with his party when he voted for President Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election.""In his first public comments about his crimes Patten submitted aexpressing remorse and describing how his actions triggered a ""very dark"" period for him and his family.""In the eight months since I pleaded guilty before you and more than a year since this journey began for me I have changed"" Patten wrote in the two-page letter which was dated March 28. ""To an even more meaningful degree than the day the FBI came to my door I have surrendered. But in admission and surrender I have also come to know a certain peace.""Patten who said in court last year that he was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression has given up drinking and attended more than 150 meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous since his guilty plea his lawyers said. They submitted 45 pages of letters asking for leniency from Patten's family friends his AA sponsor and even his childhood babysitter growing up in Maine.A sentencing hearing for Patten is scheduled for Friday. Overseeing the case is Judge Amy Berman Jackson who handled Manafort's case and several other Mueller prosecutions. Patten's sentencing waswhile he cooperated with investigators.This case is unique as Patten pleaded guilty to a crime that is rarely prosecuted by the Justice Department. Onlyhave been charged in the past 50 years with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act a federal law that was enacted shortly before World War II.The small number of comparable cases means Berman Jackson will have ""even broader discretion"" than usual when she decides Patten's fate on Friday prosecutors noted. The maximum potential sentence is five years in prison and a $250000 fine though a much less severe outcome seems likely in this case.Patten's foreign client was the Opposition Bloc a Ukrainian political party that favors close ties with Russia. The party was formed by allies of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych after he fled the country amid unrest in 2014. Patten and Manafort worked for some of the same clients and Manafort wasin prison for crimes relating to his own lobbying.CNN's Kara Scannell contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Click to subscribe!""Trump was furious with Nielsen [in May 2018] telling her he didn't think she was doing enough to secure the border. But Nielsen stood her ground citing the law in certain instances the source said.""Nielsen increasingly pushed back when the President lashed out at her department for not doing more to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants.""A senior administration official said that in recent days Trump and Nielsen had again clashed over the issue. He accused her of not doing her job and she responded forcefully.""this from The New York Time""The president called Ms. Nielsen at home early in the mornings to demand that she take action to stop migrants from entering the country including doing things that were clearly illegal such as blocking all migrants from seeking asylum. She repeatedly noted the limitations imposed on her department by federal laws court settlements and international obligations.""Those responses only infuriated Mr. Trump further. The president's fury erupted in the spring of 2018 as Ms. Nielsen hesitated for weeks about whether to sign a memo ordering the routine separation of migrant children from their families so that the parents could be detained.""There's a few things to think about here:1) Trump believes to his core -- and he's not wrong -- that if there was one reason he won in 2016 it was because of his pledge to a) build a wall along our southern border and b) broadly toughen America's immigration policies. If there is ANY campaign promise that he is absolutely and totally committed to keeping it's to be the toughest president ever when it comes to the border. One needs look no further than Trump's decision -- against his own party's wishes -- to declare a state of emergency on the southern border in order to re-appropriate money to build his wall. Or his push behind the scenes reported by CNN Monday to reinstate the policy of family separation at the border that led to a slew of very young children taken from their parents without any real way to track their whereabouts.2) Trump has very little understanding of -- or care for -- boundaries of any sort. And that goes double for immigration and border issues because of everything I mentioned above. This ispeople care about. And he'll be damned if he's told by some bureaucrat that he can't do what he wants on the border. That Trump would instruct Nielsen to block all migrants from entering the country and then blame her when she told him that was in a word illegal speaks to the detachment from reality that President has on this issue.Combine those two factors and you get this from a senior administration official on: ""[She] believed the situation was becoming untenable ... [with the President] becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests.""Think of this in your own life. Your boss calls you in. She tells you to go find a Woolly Mammoth -- and to make it snappy. (You are an assistant zookeeper in this scenario.) When you come back to her empty-handed and explain that the Woolly Mammoth went extinct around 1700 BC she tells you that you are not working hard enough to find one. And that if she was in your job she would have found a Woolly Mammoth hours ago. And that everyone knows that you can find a Woolly Mammoth if you look hard enough.Look. There are a LOT of very tough jobs in the Trump administration: chief of staff communications director and press secretary all jump to mind. But there is NO job more impossible than running the Department of Homeland Security. Nielsen made mistakes sure. But focusing on her mistakes overlooks the real story here: Donald Trump wants impossible (and at times illegal) things done by DHS to address the border crisis. And if you aren't willing to bend (or break) the rules he thinks you have failed him. And he might think you've failed him anyway; remember that Nielsen enforced a zero-tolerance policy at the border on family separations -- becoming the face of a deeply unpopular policy that Trump eventually walked away from.In short: It doesn't really matter who Trump names as Nielsen's successor. That person could be the hardest of hard immigration hard-liners. But that person will still be dealing with a Congress less than willing to greenlight some of Trump's more extreme border policies and well the rule of law. And no one person can change one of those realities much less both.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.State Dept: Two American citizens detained in Saudi ArabiState Dept: Two American citizens detained in Saudi ArabiSaudi Arabia arrested two more American citizens Friday in a direct snub to Congress a move sure to create even more domestic political heat for President Donald Trump.The detentions of activists follows US lawmakers' moves to deny support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen and Trump's promise to veto that bill as he continues his staunch defense of the kingdom a stance that has created a rare schism between the President and Republicans who are usually loath to criticism him.Given the timing and the stakes for the President the arrests are ""absolutely baffling -- and enraging"" said John Hannah a senior counselor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.The detentions part of a sweep that targeted seven Saudi writers and bloggers interested in social reform and women's rights are part of a broader crackdown by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It follows the detention and reported torture of another US citizen Dr. Walid Fitaihi and the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi a US resident.""MBS must know that the Trump administration has been expending huge amounts of political capital to shield the relationship from a Congress that is on the warpath over the murder of Khashoggi and the Yemen war"" Hannah said using the prince's nickname.sitting on the President's desk demanding that the US abandon the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen"" Hannah said. ""Yet rather than making the President's job easier MBS has just made it much more difficult.""The Saudi move against US citizens could be seen as the latest example of a nation thumbing its nose at Washington by targeting American citizens overseas. But it also reflects the peculiar dynamic that has developed between Washington and Riyadh one that has become a point of division within the Republican Party as lawmakers push back on Saudi behavior that the President has refused to condemn.The lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Michael McCaul spoke out about the Saudi detentions on Friday. ""I am deeply disturbed that Saudi Arabia has reportedly detained two more American citizens as well as other peaceful activists. This is a grave and provocative act"" McCaul said. ""The Saudi government's detention of American citizens is completely unacceptable and I call for their immediate release.""A State Department official confirmed Friday that Saudi Arabia has arrested two US citizens. ""We can confirm that two US citizens were arrested in Saudi Arabia"" the official said. ""We have already engaged the Saudi government in this regard. Due to privacy considerations we have no further comment.""detained a third American in November 2017 as part of a sweeping crackdown. Fitaihi has reportedly been beaten and tortured sources have told CNN.The State Department official said ""We are providing US citizen Walid Fitaihi consular services and we have raised his case with the Government of Saudi Arabia. We are in close communication with Mr. Fitaihi's family and will continue to offer them all possible assistance. We have raised and continue to raise his case on a consistent basis with the Saudi government.""""As far as we know the Trump administration has not imposed any cost on Saudi government or the Saudi royal family specifically Mohammed bin Salman and the King for doing what they're doing"" said David Ottaway a Saudi expert at the Wilson Center.The administration hasn't made an issue of the arrests of US citizens either ""at least not publicly"" Ottaway said. ""It would be much more significant and powerful if they did something publicly but they don't seem to want to do anything to imperil the Trump-Mohammed bin Salman relationship.""Trump and his senior administration officials have argued that the Saudi relationship is too crucial to disrupt. They cite Saudi financial support for an eventual agreement between Israelis and Palestinians the campaign to counter Iran and the Kingdom's purchases of weapons systems.Trump's critics have also raised questions about whether his and his family'swith Saudi Arabia are influencing policy decisions.Saudi Arabia isn't the only country holding Americans. Russia is holding American security executive Paul Whelan on charges of espionage while China is reportedly detaining US citizens in its vast prison camps meant to ""re-educate"" Uighur Muslims and other minorities. Iran holds at least five Americans.In contrast to the Trump administration's public restraint about Americans held by the Saudis this week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for Turkey's ""swift resolution of cases involving unjustly detained US citizens"" and local staff from the US mission in Turkey.The Trump administration has made energetic efforts to bring Americans home returning more than a dozen in the last two years from North Korea Venezuela Egypt Pakistan and Turkey. Experts say that the best estimate is that 3000 Americans are held around the world and 100 of them are in hostage situations.But Saudi Arabia is a particular case.Aaron David Miller a vice president at the Wilson Center said it's ""not all that surprising"" that the Saudis would feel emboldened to target Americans. ""MBS believes Trump has his back. There's not a shred of empirical evidence to suggest that he doesn't"" Miller said.The US has imposed sanctions on individuals involved in Khashoggi's premeditated murder which US intelligence has concluded with high confidence was ordered by the crown prince. Beyond that it has taken little action though the State Department concluded in a March 2019 report that the killing was a human rights abuse. And Trump has raised doubts about US intelligence conclusions saying of MBS' involvement ""maybe he did it maybe he didn't.""marked the first sweep against dissidents since Khashoggi's death in October. Salah al-Haidar a dual Saudi-US citizen who is the son of prominent women's rights defender Aziza al-Yousef was arrested along with US citizen writer and physician Bader al-Ibrahim sources told CNN.The Saudi government did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment about the case.Miller said the timing coming as Congress and the President are facing off over Yemen ""has more to do with [the Saudis] complete and utter tone deafness their conviction that Trump appears willing to have their back regardless. After all they've already detained one American citizen who they've purportedly tortured the doctor so they detain another one or two? They've already committed the ultimate transgression of the murder of a resident of the United States.""Hannah of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies argues that ""the US-Saudi relationship is approaching a crisis stage.""""It's about time that the President do something that he's never done before: pick up the phone and give King Salman and MBS a true wake up call to warn them of how dire the situation is and to let them know that they're undercutting what remains of his ability to protect the strategic partnership"" Hannah said.Miller argues that the Kingdom will simply disregard lawmakers. ""What's the point of Congress when you have a personal relationship with the President anyway"" he said.CNN's Stephen Collinson Jamie Crawford and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this repor9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Scott Applewhite)Although Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a letter to the House Natural Resources Committee in February that he didn't keep calendars and the records of his daily schedule others kept for him were public the Department recently published to its website hundreds of pages of documents that reveal new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of his calendars.The House Natural Resources Committee requested ""all calendars and schedules"" of Bernhardt's on Feb. 7 after saying the versions posted on the Interior Department's website were missing important details and excluding meeting descriptions or topics for more than 100 hours of ""official government time"" according to the committee's letter.to the committee by stating that he had ""no legal obligation to personally maintain a calendar.""He said ""numerous people"" who create calendar entries for him have made those entries public.""To the extent Agency records are created through that process they are appropriately maintained to fully comply with the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act"" he said in the letter.Now days before his confirmation vote to be the next Interior Secretary the Interior Department released 439 pages of documents spanning from Sept. 2017 to Nov. 2018 with more information about Bernhardt's daily schedule than previously released by the department.Getting a complete picture of what the former Deputy now Acting and if confirmed the next Secretary of the Interior Department has been doing since he started in 2017 has been an ongoing battle for outside watchdog groups and Congress.Interior said that the new documents released this week were not calendars but ""daily cards"" which are ""created the evening before or sometimes early the morning of each workday."" The Interior Department said these daily cards are a ""synopsis of the Acting Secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of his upcoming events"" and are often ""outdated by midday"" according to a letter and statement Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort provided to CNN.A previous analysis by the House Natural Resources Committee and outside groups found that the versions of Bernhardt's calendars published on the Interior Department's website were missing meetings altogether. Multiple versions of his daily schedule had been created in Google Calendar and the versions online were not complete according to a source familiar with the investigation.During a House Oversight and Government Reform committee hearing on March 13 an Interior FOIA official acknowledged that she was aware of the issue that some items from Bernhardt's calendars had been deleted.When Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) asked Interior Deputy Chief FOIA officer Rachel Spector if she was aware of calendar entries being deleted she said ""I have some familiarity with the issue that you are raising and understand that the solicitor's office in the Department is working with the records officer in the Department to determine what's occurred there and whether it's consistent.""Bernhardt is a former oil and gas lobbyist and has recused himself from certain dealings with his former clients for a period of time. Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee questioned Bernhardt's priorities and conduct since joining the Interior Department insinuating that his lobbying ties were influencing his policy decisions.While Bernhardt signed an ethics agreement when he joined the department and said during his confirmation hearing that he has complied with all of his ethics requirements Congressmen and watchdog groups were concerned by the lack of transparency in the initial calendars.""The only reason to take all these steps to overwrite your actual calendar every day is if you are trying to conceal what you're doing from the American people"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. The Center for Western Priorities is a conservation group that has been critical of the Trump administration.House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-NM) acknowledged that releasing the full unredacted versions of Bernhardt's daily calendars was a step toward being more transparent. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who resigned last year amid multiple ethics investigations left meetings off of his calendars as wellGrijalva said that while Interior is ""notorious"" for not responding to FOIA requests ""of any kind"" he hoped their release of the new calendar information was a move towards greater transparency.""I hope they've had an epiphany that they understand that these requests the requests the committee's making are not burdensome"" Grijalva told CNN. ""I think they came to the realization that if pressed on the issue they would have to release them anyway.""In a response to the committee's requests Bernhardt asked Grijalva to publicly disclose all of his meetings as well.""Given your recognition of the acute need for transparency I encourage you in your new leadership role to join me in adopting this disclosure procedure. Together our leadership on this issue will provide a good example"" Bernhardt said in the letter to Grijalva.When asked for comment from Interior in response to Grijalva's comments Interior asked if Grijalva had agreed to disclose his meetings like Bernhardt has.""Has he committed to do so like the Acting Secretary has? I haven't seen"" Vander Voort said.In the 439 pages now available on Interior's website of Bernhardt's daily schedule a cursory comparison reveals several discrepancies between the previously released calendars found on the same page of Interior's website and the documents published this week. In some instances meetings that included little detailed information in the older version now say who Bernhardt met with or the topic of an internal meeting.In the previous versions of the calendars there were a number of entries that excluded descriptive information and instead offered general terms like ""external meeting"" ""event"" or ""call time.""In the new version of the calendars some descriptions of those external meetings shed more light on who Bernhardt has met with during his time at the department.When comparing April 2018 between the previously released version and the new version of the calendars there are two instances where Bernhardt met with people who work with or for his previous clients that are listed on his ethics agreement as entities he has recused himself from.Bernhardt signed an ethics agreement stating he would recuse himself from working with certain businesses but he is still allowed to meet with people that work at those businesses.On April 12 Bernhardt met with Lynne Hackedorn the new calendar reveals. On the older version of his calendar this event was listed as a ""personal meeting."" Hackedorn was the Vice President of Government Affairs at Cobalt International Energy a former Bernhardt client that is included on his ethics agreement. Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said the meeting was personal and Hackedorn was no longer employed by Cobalt when she met with Bernhardt.On April 17 the new calendar listed a meeting between Bernhardt and Ed Manning from 9:30-10:00 am. The previous version did not include this entry because the meeting was cancelled Vander Voort said. Manning is a lobbyist for KP Public Officials who has represented the Westlands Water District also listed on Bernhardt's ethics agreement.On April 18 a meeting at 4 p.m. that was listed as an external meeting on the original calendar is revealed to be a meeting with the National Mining Association on the new version.Some of the discrepancies between the two calendars give more context to internal meetings as well. On April 12 a meeting that was listed as ""Briefing with BLM"" on the original version of Bernhardt's calendar is listed as ""Sage Grouse Update"" in the new version. Interior finalized ain March that opens up land previously protected as a habitat for the sage grouse bird to oil and gas drilling. The policy change outraged advocacy groups who have closely monitored the agency's every move regarding the sage grouse and Grijalva called it a ""smash-and-grab job on our environment.""On April 24 a meeting at 2 p.m. originally titled ""Briefing with FWS"" meaning U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services an office within Interior is titled ""FWS Monsanto MOU"" in the new version of the calendars. MOU stands for Memorandum of Understanding. Monsanto is a large and influential biotech company.""There is no legal protocol that defines the way a public official must label events on their calendar and the Department has taken great strides to publicly disclose all meetings held with individuals or parties other than government entities"" Vander Voort said in a statement.The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted to advance Bernhardt's nomination on April 4 a procedural step with a vote of 14-6. The Senate will vote on Bernhardt's confirmation as soon as next week.CNN's Curt Devine and Drew Griffin contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Trump's lawyers call request for tax returns 'inappropriate'Trump's lawyers call request for tax returns 'inappropriate'The Trump administration has just days to respond toa request from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Nealto turn over six years of President Donald Trump's business and personal tax returns.But while the deadline is Wednesday the showdown for the tax returns is expected to last much longer as both sides dig in.What happens next is not immediately clear though the legal posturing on both sides suggests that a court battle could be on the horizon. Before that however expect the team behind the President and the team behind Neal to produce a lot of paperwork supporting why they're right and the other is wrong.Trump has been clear he has no intention of making this fight easy. On Fridayhis lawyers sent a letter to the Department of Treasury's counseldismissing the request for tax returns as a politically-motivated pursuit writing that ""Ways and Means has no legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President's tax returns or return information. While the committee has jurisdiction over taxes it has no power to conduct its own examination of individual taxpayers.""""The idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon is incorrect as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally"" Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We should not be in a situation where individual private tax returns are used for political purpose. What stops another party from doing the same thing by the way.""spent months preparing a case to obtaiTrump's tax returns -- won't take no for an answer. Using a little-known provision in the tax code the Massachusetts Democrat is requesting the tax returns under 6103 a statute that allows the chairman of House Ways and Means panel to make requests for individuals' tax information. Neal and Democrats have argued that the law clearly states that if the chairman asks for the information the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it.""This was a very reasonable approach"" Neal told reporters last week. ""We wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts.""Read: Trump lawyers send letter to Treasury Dept pushing back on tax return requestHe added that if the IRS still doesn't respond they will decide on next steps but he assured us ""surely there will be one.""An aide close the process told CNN that Neal is expected to send at least one followup letter reiterating his request maybe even more but that the steps after that are still being discussed. Tax law experts are divided about whether or not Neal would issue a subpoena on top of his request or whether the 6103 authority implies the power to receive the information on its own. In that case the question is whether a subpoena actually undermines the chairman's 6103 authority.""A subpoena is a tactical decision. It is not required"" said Andy Wright former associate counsel for President Barack Obama.Before the request was made last week liberals on the committee had pushed Neal more and more publicly to seek Trump's returns but Neal moved on his own timeline cognizant of the political storm that would ensue after he sent his official letter.Trump's attorneys have also been preparing for the anticipated request a source close to Trump's legal team told CNN.""We've been looking at this issue for several months"" the source said.Why American may never see Trump's tax returnThe legal road ahead is a long one. The 1920s era law is largely untested in court with vast questions remaining about how broad a chairman's congressional authority is. While 6103 requests are made all the time for compiling research the request of an individual's personal tax returns as high-profile as the President has raised questions. And if Neal gets the returns there are questions about how much he would publicly be able to share.Even if Neal obtained Trump's tax returns and the other tax information he's requested after a protracted legal battle the public still won't automatically see them. Instead the chairman would get the returns and then under the law he alone would have the authority to look at them unless he designates others to see them. Those designees could include members of the committee or members of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Once those individuals have the power to look at the tax information they are subject to harsh punishments if any of the information is leaked. That penalty is $250000 fine and five years in prison per infraction. It's serious.If Neal wanted to make the returns public -- and Neal has not said what he plans to do with the returns if he obtained them -- there is a process. Neal would put the committee into a private session and then the committee would vote.That would be a rare event. The last time Congress made the decision to disclose private tax information was during the fight over whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups. Then however the vote was bipartisan. Releasing Trump's tax info would likely split along party lines.What would the returns even show?There are still real questions about how informational Trump's tax returns would even be. Six years of returns including two while Trump was President will paint some picture but not necessarily a comprehensive one. That is why while Neal is asking for tax returns he is also asking for ""all administrative files"" including ""workpapers affidavits etc.""Tax returns can't tell the committee everything but the administrative files could be more revealing including worksheets and audit reports. This is where the committee would actually learn how the presidential audit process works and if Trump was under audit as a private citizen.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Herman Cain: Let them go out and dig up old allegationHerman Cain: Let them go out and dig up old allegationPresident Donald Trump recently named his two picks for the Federal Reserve -- but a top economic adviser cautioned Monday that the nominations aren't final until they're formally sent to the Senate.Speaking to reporters at the White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett said it was too early in the process to comment on the potential nominations.Hassett stressed that both Herman Cain and Stephen Moore are currently in the ""intent to nominate"" phase of the process which means they are subject to vetting and paperwork within the administration ahead of a formal nomination.""That's exactly how it works for every single nominee is that there's an intent to nominate and then people fill out their forms and then they decide you know whether they want to move forward after they look at what they have to recuse themselves from and so on and then the nomination officially goes to the Senate"" Hassett said.Since the President announced his intent to nominate Moore and Cain concerns have arisen about challenges for both of their confirmations. Moore an economic commentator and former CNN contributorowes $75000 in taxes and penaltieto the United States government. And Cain a businessman and former Federal Reserve regional board memberthat effectively ended his 2012 presidential campaign.Hassett said that potential candidates should be given privacy and time to work potential conflicts out with the Office of Government Ethics and provide as much information as possible to ensure that the Senate can have a ""fact-based debate"" once the formal nominations are submitted.""I think the President has a lot of confidence in both (Moore and Cain)"" Hassett said when asked by CNN whether he was concerned about the impact allegations against Cain could have on his confirmation process.He continued ""And that point I think is the right time to debate everything about that we've learned about the past. And part of the process identifies those things as well.""Trump who has openly expressed his frustration with Fed chair Jerome Powell -- a former investment banker Trump selected in 2017 -- over interest rate hikes announced last week he intends to nominate Cain for a seat on the board of the world's most powerful central bank. In March he also said he would nominate Moore a former 2016 campaign adviser to a seat.Chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday offered a stronger defense of the picks.Kudlow called criticism that the possible nominations of the two longtime Trump supporters would politicize the Federal Reserve ""very unfair.""""Let's take Herman Cain. Besides being a very successful entrepreneurial businessman he was a board member of the Kansas City Federal Reserve and actually was the chairman of the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. His time there spans I think about a decade. He's intimately acquainted with Federal Reserve operations and policy issues so I think these criticisms are very unfair"" Kudlow told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""But asked about the sexual harassment allegations against Cain Kudlow also pointed to the vetting process signaling the nominations are not yet a done deal.""We are going through a vetting process in the White House. I'm sure the Senate Banking Committee will do likewise. There's big disputes here. Mr. Cain disagrees with this point of view (of one of the accusers). I'm not going to litigate that here"" he said.Cain suspended his bid for the Republican nomination for president in 2011 after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment when he was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s and one woman claimed she had a 13-year affair with Cain.Pressed again Kudlow said ""Whether it's Supreme Court justices or many other things we've seen a lot of charges here. They don't necessarily pan out.""He then said that Trump ""has every right in the world to nominate people who share his economic philosophy.""Cain said in a Facebook video posted Friday that he'steeling himself for a tough selection procesafter sexual harassment allegations rocked his 2012 presidential bid.The former business executive said on Facebook Watch's ""The Herman Cain Show"" he was eager to air things out in the open.""You better believe that the people who hate me who do not like conservatism Republicans are already digging up all of the negative stuff that's in stories from eight years ago"" Cain said.""So be it. Let them go back and dig up eight-year-old stuff. I will be able to explain it this time where they wouldn't let me explain it the last time"" Cain said. ""They were too busy believing the accusers. I'm not mad y'all. I'm just not going to let the accusers run my life. Or determine my career.""CNN's Greg Clary contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Trump punts health care until after 2020 electioTrump punts health care until after 2020 electioActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that the White House plans to release an Obamacare replacement plan before the 2020 election after hosting top administration officials at Camp David over the weekend for a meeting on health care.""I do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly"" Mulvaney told ""Fox News Sunday.""White House aides and administration officials -- including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Seema Verma administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- huddled at the historic Maryland property on Saturday to discuss the general path forward for President Trump's health care policy White House aides said.The talks ranged from messaging strategies to lowering drug prices to individual health insurance marketplaces. And while Trump this week ruled out taking a vote on an Affordable Care Act alternative prior to the election amid Republican resistance to the prospect Mulvaney said the forthcoming plan would provide GOP candidates with campaign fodder.""Republicans have better ideas than Democrats. We should not be afraid to talk about that"" Mulvaney said on Fox News. ""We want to run on this.""Trump stunned Republicans late last month when he paired his administration's decision to back an Obamacare court challenge with a call for the GOP to develop a legislative replacement. White House allies lawmakers and even members of Trump's own staff werewhen the Justice Department filed a brief in court supporting the complete invalidation of the Affordable Care Act without preparing anything to take its place should that ruling stand.Unhappy with the President's decision to plunge the party back into a battle it lost less than two years ago Republicans said they would await guidance from the White House. Trump in turn said he would ask GOP senators to craft a plan -- leaving the White House and Congressfingers at each other over who should take the lead in writing health care policy.Graham-Cassidy a health care proposal floated in 2017 as their starting point for the development of a plan. But even Trump's legislative team wasby the news that the President wanted a renewed focus on health care and the administration has scrambled to come up with a plan that did not exist before Trump waded back into the issue.Top Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately attempted to persuade Trump that a health care push would not only fail but backfire on Republicans running up and down the ticket in 2020Trump on Wednesday claimed he never intended to request a vote before next year's election noting he had ""very talented people"" working on a replacement plan for him.""It will be on full display during the Election as a much better &amp; less expensive alternative to ObamaCare"" Trump tweeted. ""This will be a great campaign issue.""Democrats running in 2018 midterm races seized on voters' concerns about health care and their heavy focus on the issue helped propel enough candidates to victory in Republican-held districts that the GOP lost control of the House in November. Now Democratic presidential hopefuls are spending significant time on the campaign trail talking about health care -- with many candidates promoting universal programs like ""Medicare for All.""Mulvaney on Sunday argued Republicans who tried unsuccessfully in 2017 to pass health care reform when they controlled both chambers of Congress need competing ideas to present to voters in 2020.""You can't beat something with nothing"" he said.""Democrats have already admitted that Obamacare doesn't work -- that's why they're out there talking about this amorphous Medicare for All"" he said.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Formed after the Islamic revolution in 1979 the IRGC is not only Iran's most powerful military institution it holds deep influence over domestic politics and the economy with interests extending to and beyond the construction telecommunications auto and energy industries.Beyond the internal dissent the designation triggered within the US government the move could also increase tensions with allies particularly where the IRGC has ties to militias and officials and Lebanon where it backs Hezbollah which is part of the government.Iran's Supreme National Security Council responded Monday by declaring the US a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" and American troops operating in the region as ""terrorist groups"" according to IRNA Iran's state-run news agency.""The Islamic Republic of Iran declares itself in reciprocity against the unlawful and unreasonable action of the United States today considering the United States as a terrorist sponsored government and the Central Command of the United States CENTCOM and all its affiliated forces as terrorist groups"" the National Security Council of the Islamic Republic of Iran said in a statement IRNA reported.""Obviously the US regime will take all the responsibility for the dangerous consequences of this undertaking"" the statement said.The IRGC designation marks the first time that the United States has ever named a part of another government as a foreign terrorist organization.In an important step to counter the Iranian regime's terrorism the U.S. has designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps incl. Qods Force as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. We must help the people of Iran get back their freedom.It takes effect on April 15 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the State Department Monday.Economic and travel sanctions on the elite military group mean any group or individual that does business with the IRGC could face criminal prosecution for providing material support to a terrorist organization.""This historic step will deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world"" Pompeo said. He warned that businesses with a presence in Iran or engaged with its companies will have to take extra steps to ensure they are not violating US sanctions.Brian Hook a senior policy adviser to Pompeo said Monday that the IRGC controls ""up to half Iran's economy.""""It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant amount of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy"" Pompeo said. ""Businesses and banks around the world now have a clear duty to ensure that companies with which they conduct transactions are not connected to the IRGC in any material way.""Senior officials said the designation decision formally under the State Department's purview represents the next step in the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign against Iran but the move had met with internal resistance because of concerns about American troops in the Middle East.Defense officials have told CNN that US troops in Syria and Iraq often find themselves operating in close proximity to members of the IRGC. The US has about 5000 troops in Iraq and close to 2000 in Syria.Last year CNN reported that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats cautioned the administration that designating the IRGC could pose dangers to US forces according to one source familiar with the matter.Asked about the risks to US troops in the Middle East and particularly in Iraq Hook told reporters at the State Department that ""the decision leading up to this process was a full interagency process that included every member of the NSC. We have taken all measures that are appropriate and prudent in the context of this designation.""He added that ""whenever we and other nations call out and expose the regime for what it is it behaves like a mafia organization increasing its threats. We will not be deterred by their threats.""Nathan Sales the State Department's Coordinator for Counterterrorism said the agency would not discuss details of measures being taken to ensure the safety of US personnel.""I can assure you that we take force protection very very seriously. And that is why we have run a robust interagency process to make sure that all interested parties are prepared for whatever the Iranian regime might throw at us"" he said speaking alongside Hook Monday.Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich Pentagon spokeswoman said Monday that ""the Department of Defense is prepared to implement the President and Secretary of State's decision to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.""""As a matter of policy we do not discuss adjustments to force protection levels or measures for operational security reasons"" Rebarich continued. ""As always DoD has taken prudent measures to ensure the safety of our forces around the world and maintain our readiness to carry out our missions.""who have long agitated for FTO designation of the IRGC fully understand its consequences for US forces in the region. In fact they seek to drag US into a quagmire on his behalf.should know better than to be conned into another US disaster.Mark Dubowitz CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said it was ""fitting that the most dangerous terrorist group in the world responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents and backed by a massive state apparatus and vast energy wealth is being designated finally as a foreign terrorist organization.""The designation now means ""the US government can truly unleash its full economic prosecutorial and political powers"" to punish Iran Dubowitz said.Trita Parsi the author of ""Losing an Enemy - Obama Iran and the Triumph of Diplomacy"" warned that the designation carries significant political implications and ultimately will not serve US security interests.""This move closes yet another potential door for peacefully resolving tensions with Iran"" Parsi said. ""Once all doors are closed and diplomacy is rendered impossible war will essentially become inevitable ... this decision does not in any way shape or form serve US national security.

""Thank you for responding to another one of my important requests that serves our interests and the interests of regional countries.""The IRGC designation follows Trump's March 21 announcement that the US would recognize Israeli control of the Golan Heights a step that counters United Nations resolutions against land being seized by force.

I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!"" Trump continued.Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position and I would like to thank her for her service....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Nielsen did not resign willingly a person close to her told CNN but was under pressure to do so. Nielsen did not fight nor grovel to keep her job the source said. Nielsen should be staying for a week of transition another White House official said.McAleenan is a holdover from the Obama administration. He was sworn in on March 20 2018 as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He is expected to serve as the acting secretary ""in the short term"" meaning he is not expected to be in the position for the long term according to a White House official.Senior administration officials told CNN that Nielsen had a 5 p.m. meeting at the White House with Trump where she was planning to discuss with him the immigration and border issues and a path forward. She had no intention of resigning according to one of the sources but rather was going there with an agenda.Trump had grown increasingly frustrated with the situation at the border which has seen an influx in migrants predominantly from Northern Triangle countries.In California on Friday a senior administration official tells CNN Trump told border agents he wanted them to stop letting people cross the border despite the fact that Central American asylum seekers according to US law can do so.Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable with the President becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests"" a senior administration official tells CNN.""I hereby resign from the position of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) effective April 7th 2019"" Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. ""Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside.""READ: Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation letter from DHS secretary posthat she ""agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted.""Removing Nielsen and installing McAleenan as acting secretary presents issues for the line of succession. Putting McAleenan in charge skips over acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady who also serves in the Senate confirmed role as the Undersecretary of Management which raises questions about her future. A senior administration official told CNN that legally Grady is next in line and will have to go in order for McAleenan to assume the role of acting secretary. Another official asked about this question told CNN there are issues that need to be addressed before McAleenan can take over.In a series of tweets Nielsen said ""it has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women"" of DHS and repeated what she also said in her resignation letter that she ""could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service.""Nielsen has felt ""in limbo"" for the last week a person close to her says as she bore the brunt of the President's anger over the border.She's been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She did not realize how dire it was when she left the US last weekend but quickly did as she abruptly returned.She did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her the source close to Nielsen said but to little avail.""Nothing she could do or say could change how the President started viewing her"" the source close to Nielsen said.That said she was prepared to be fired at any moment but did not know going into Sunday's meeting it would be imminent.Democrats immediately reacted to the news.""Hampered by misstep after misstep Kirstjen Nielsen's tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start. It is clearer now than ever that the Trump Administration's border security and immigration policies - that she enacted and helped craft - have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border"" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson in a statement.Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee acknowledged Nielsen's challenges in a statement and expressed confidence in McAleenan and whomever the President nominated later.""Secretary Nielsen served her country honorably as Homeland Security Secretary despite facing numerous challenges including dire conditions at our southwest border"" Rogers said. ""Although Commissioner McAleenan will have his work cut out for him I am confident the department is in capable hands. I look forward to working with McAleenan in his new role and to learning who the president intends to nominate on a permanent basis.""The departure comes just days after Trump suddenlywithdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement directo blindsiding the Department of Homeland Security and the Hill. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination had been pulled a person familiar with the news said. The announcement Sunday also followsplans to cut aid to some Central American countrie marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had days earlier visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala.Nielsen has had a tumultuous tenure that saw Trump steadily ramping up pressure on his team to execute his immigration promises which he believes is the single driving issue for his base of political supporters.Trump has vented privately that Nielsen hasn't adequately secured the border or enacted stricter immigration rules even as she became the face of policies that administration critics called heartless and illegal.Incoming acting secretary of Homeland Security 'not an ideologue or fire breather'In recent weeks administration officials have been sounding the alarm over the increase in migrants at the southern border underscoring the change in demographics as one of the reasons for the host of challenges they're facing. McAleenan said late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100000 migrants in March alone making it ""the highest month since 2008.""""Right now we have an emergency on our hands. We need to treat it as such"" Nielsen told Chris Cuomo on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Thursday. Nielsen who served in President George W. Bush's administration never overcame internal skepticism about her allegiance to Trump. She joined the administration as chief of staff to John Kelly who was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary.When Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff Nielsen followed becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff.The role didn't gain her popularity but it helped her gain enough of Trump's trust to elevate her to the Cabinet post.But at the agency that oversees border protection and immigration matters -- Trump's signature issue -- it was inevitable Nielsen would find herself in the President's crosshairs.After a previous Cabinet meeting during which Trump berated her for not acting strongly enough on preventing illegal immigration Nielsen considered resigning people familiar with the matter said at the time.She didn't then and went on to become one of the public faces of a controversial policy that separated families at the southern border.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement on Nielsen's resignation saying ""It is deeply alarming that the Trump Administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House's liking.""Pelosi went on to say ""The President's dangerous and cruel anti-immigrant policies have only worsened the humanitarian suffering at the border and inflicted vast suffering on the families who have been torn apart.""The President posted on Twitter shortly after announcing Nielsen's departure that the ""Country is FULL!"" and wrote there have been more apprehensions at the southern border ""than in many years."" He called on Congress to ""fix loopholes"" and reiterated his threat to close the border.This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.CNN's Jeff Zeleny Kevin Liptak Evan Perez Tammy Kupperman Geneva Sands Phil Mattingly and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

They include former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and former chief of staff John Kelly.Yet there is also a more fundamental reason for Nielsen's departure that gets closer to the heart of Trump's behavior and political strategy than almost all of the many previous exits from his administration.Nielsen's demise is the clearest indication yet of the impossibility of reconciling Trump's ideological and emotional instincts on immigration -- which helped make him President -- with legal humanitarian and international realities.Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable"" with Trump ""becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests"" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday.Her departure mirrors that of former Defense Secretary James Mattis last year whose authority was shredded by a sudden and apparently spontaneous announcement of a Syria withdrawal by the President but who had gradually grown apart from his boss.In both cases the complexity of serious policy problems often in life or death situations clashed with the political instincts of a President who abhors detail and prefers to govern from the gut while ignoring conventional expertise -- even from subordinates that in no way could be considered moderates.As the crisis on the US-Mexico border worsened Trump's tolerance for Nielsen snapped.And the President might also have gone looking for a scapegoat.Last week he was forced to climb down on a public threat to close the southern border after officials business groups and political leaders warned of a pending economic disaster if he went ahead.He covered his blushes by going on a tear on immigration with some of the most unconstrained rhetoric on the issue ever heard by an American president that was scorching even by the standards of Trump himself.""Can't take you anymore. Can't take you. Our country is full ... Can't take you anymore I'm sorry. So turn around. That's the way it is"" Trump said in a message to asylum seekers during a trip to the border on Friday.A day later Trump mocked those fleeing persecution seeking a better life in the United States portraying asylum seekers as criminals and gang members rather than the families Nielsen described in a CNN interview last week.""'I am very fearful for my life'"" Trump said mockingly during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition on Saturday. ""I am very worried that I will be accosted if I am sent back home. No no he'll do the accosting!""""Asylum oh give him asylum! He's afraid!"" Trump said.Secy. Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving Trump tweetSecy. Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving Trump tweetNielsen's departure confirmed in a tense White House meeting with Trump on Sunday afternoon came after days of speculation and was in retrospect a logical consequence of the President's boiling frustration.He had been dissatisfied with Nielsen for months though their relationship appeared to improve marginally during the government shutdown that spanned the turn of the year and turned into another political reverse for Trump.Speculation about her status ballooned last week afterTrump suddenly declared that he would halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aito Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala accusing them of sending migrants to the US border.The move utterly undercut Nielsen who had just days before signed what her department called a ""historic regional compact"" to tackle undocumented migration at its source.Immigration experts said that the aid cutoff would ultimately make the situation far worse as it would exacerbate the deprivation and lawlessness in Central America that is a key driver of migration and asylum claims.Nielsen's departure comes as more critical moments loom for the administration that are likely to test Trump's equilibrium at a time when he is already furious about the border situation.When he was not fulminating about immigration over the weekend he was lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and Democratic demands that all of his report should be released.Attorney General William Barr caught between an angry President and Democrats in Congress after finding there was no evidence to support election collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-month.The White House is also trying to escape a self-imposed snafu over health care policy after sending confusing signals of whether the President wanted a new bid to replace Obamacare before or after the 2020 election.And this week the administration is expected to significantly escalate tensions with Iran by against throwing caution to the wind by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization a move some in the defense and intelligence communities fear could expose US personnel in the Middle East to reprisals.Cuomo to DHS Sec: Why's Trump viewing fencing not kids?Cuomo to DHS Sec: Why's Trump viewing fencing not kids?As he seeks to manage the immigration crisis the President now has a chance to insert a like-minded replacement in what in the wake of Nielsen's departure looks like an increasingly impossible job.Trump has already signaled that he will make immigration a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election bid and has every political incentive since he is basing his hopes of a second term on energizing his base to turn up the heat on the issue.The new secretary will also face the same limits as Nielsen. As much as Trump rages against asylum claims they are codified in US and international laws that he in practice cannot just disregard.He recently found out that his preferred dramatic solution of just closing the border would cause a swift and massive economic backlash that in itself could harm his hopes of winning a second term.The President is already pushing his power to the limit and possibly beyond it by seeking to use a national emergency declaration to redirect money already allocated by Congress for other projects to the border wall that was at the symbolic center of his 2016 campaign.For all his fiery speeches it is difficult for Trump to argue that his hardline approach on immigration is actually working.After years of declines the tide of asylum seeking and undocumented migrants crossing the border has climbed dramatically.The White House says US Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100000 border enforcement actions in March -- the most for one month in more than a decade.It argues that Trump has reassigned customs officers to the border and directed them to return as many migrants as possible to Mexico to wait for immigration proceedings on the southern side of the border.But ultimately there will be no solution to the border problem and the chronic glut in the asylum and court systems without action by Congress.Nielsen did ""everything she could to make the problem better"" a senior Department of Homeland Security official told CNN's Geneva Sands on Sunday.""Worst place for you to be is where you need Congress to act"" the official said.The White House wants asylum law tightened and the power to detain families traveling with children -- a practice Democrats have branded inhumane. the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection as acting replacement for Nielsen at the Department of Homeland Security.McAleenan is not seen as an ideologue and served former President Barack Obama -- so there must be considerable doubt about how long he will also be in the post -- but he has less problematic ties with Congress than Nielsen.READ: Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation letter from DHS secretary posAttempts at reaching a broad political solution on the border have been complicated by Trump's choice to use immigration as a rallying call for his base and his adoption of rhetoric that stains any political common ground.He has several times pulled out of immigration deals with Democrats that might have helped mitigate the situation at the border apparently because he feared a backlash from his most fervent supporters and cheerleaders in conservative media.Democrats complain that the so-called master of the art of the deal wants to win on all his immigration priorities while offering nothing in return -- for example a path to legal status for people brought to the US illegally and who are protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.They also argue that his rhetoric is incompatible with the founding principles of a nation built on immigration.""When even the most radical voices in the administration aren't radical enough for President Trump you know he's completely lost touch with the American people"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday remarking on Nielsen's departure.Yet while there is evidence that Trump's flame throwing commentary on immigration hurt Republicans in swing districts and helped Democrats win the House in midterm elections Trump's warning that the US is under assault by marauding caravans of immigrants is widely backed by his supporters.That's why ultimately even Nielsen who was reviled on the left over the family separations policy and attempted to shape the President's instincts into a workable policy always seemed doomed.Trump has shown that he will always eventually side with the themes and voters that powered his political rise even faced with insurmountable political and practical obstacles.CNN's Jim Acosta Geneva Sands Jeff Zeleny Kaitlan Collins Jeremy Diamond and Jake Tapper.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi left and US President Donald Trump met in Riyadh Saudi Arabia on May 21 2017.As President Trump prepares to have a warm welcome for Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Tuesday for the second time at the White House rights groups say they are intensifying their efforts to lobby members of Congress for a less friendly visit.Egyptian officials are hailing the meeting which came at the invitation of the US administration as a high mark for a new era of relations between the two countries.""President Sisi has been able to restore Egyptian-American relations to their former political and economic prosperity"" said Ashraf Osman an influential member of Egypt's parliament.The meeting on Tuesday will focus on building the ""robust military economic and counterterrorism cooperation"" between Washington and Cairo the White House said.But the meeting this week is not without controversy.Human rights groups have accused the Egyptian regime ofcarrying out widespread and systematic torture of political prisonerusing death sentences to settle score.  Sisi's government has vehemently denied the allegations.But rights groups continue to raise Cairo's dismal human rights record as an issue that congressmen should take into account when officials meet Sisi this week. It's a topic Secretary of State Mike Pompeonotably did not mention during his last visit to CairAmnesty International along with Egyptians Abroad For Democracy Worldwide have been working for the last year in a joint effort to lobby Congress to ""oppose the death penalty in Egypt and to improve human rights"" according to documents shared with CNN.The groups are also lobbying to make $1.3 billion of military aid this year conditional on improving human rights in Egypt.The State Department has sought the same amount in foreign military financing for Egypt in its 2020 budget request indicating that the administration wants to keep business as usual with Cairo. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US foreign military aid.Voters have few options in EgypVoters have few options in EgypLast year the Trump administration released$195 million in military aid to Egyptwhich had been temporarily withheld due to concerns over the country's human rights record. The State Department cited ""steps"" taken by Cairo in response to ""specific U.S. concerns"" when the funds were released.But rights groups continue to lobby Congress to make the annual military aid conditional on Egypt achieving certain democratic benchmarks. However the White House has so far avoided such conditions by pressuring Congress to include a ""national security waiver"" on the aid legislation.Amnesty and Egyptians Abroad for Democracy Worldwide have a letter that is circulating Congress to encourage members ""to consider the executions and human rights in their discussion on US financial aid to Egypt"" Amnesty International's Egypt Country Specialist Geoffrey Mock said.But President Trump is likely to ignore those efforts as he holds talks with Sisi this week -- their sixth meeting since 2016 according a report released by Egypt's presidency.Trump is not expected to mention controversial constitutional amendments including an extension to Egyptian presidential terms that could seeSisi remain in office until 2034.The two leaders are expected to talk about the fight against ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula and a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to state-run Ahram Online citing a spokesman to the Egyptian president.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Under IRS code 6103 only the Joint Committee on Taxation the House Ways and Means chairman and the Senate Finance Committee chairman have the authority to request the tax information of an individual.But in a detailed letter to the general counsel of the Treasury Department on Friday Consovoy said that ""the committee's authority is subject to important constraints"" which he said citing the tax code ""extend to the ordinary taxpayer and the President alike.""Consovoy said that Neal does not have a ""legitimate committee purpose"" for obtaining the tax returns adding that Neal's request ""is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech.""Republicans warn Trump tax request 'sets a dangerous standard' and accuse Dems of weaponizing IRSTrump's attorneys have been preparing for several months to beat back an anticipated request for the President's tax returns a source close to Trump's legal team tells CNN.""We've been looking at this issue for several months"" the source said.""it's not just a tax issue"" the source added. ""In fact it's really not a tax issue it's really a statutory and constitutional issue.""After Democrats won the House it became clear that they would try and use the little known provision of the tax code to request Trump's tax returns from the IRS. Trump's attorneys wanted to be ready to go for when Neal decided to pull the trigger on his request.The President and his legal team decided to entrust the case to Consovoy and his firm in part because he had already been representing the President in the emoluments case.""This is not a new team member"" the source points out.The Democrats' request was also rebuked by congressional Republicans with House Republican Leader Kevinthat it ""sets a dangerous standard of having the federal government used as a political weapon"" and dismissing the move as ""a waste of time.""Trump himself sidestepped a question Thursday afternoon over whether he will tell the commissioner of the IRS to not comply with the congressional request for his tax returns.""They'll speak to my lawyers and they'll speak to the attorney general"" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office.And on Friday when asked if he was confident he would be able to keep the Democrats from obtaining his taxes Trump told reporters: ""Oh I don't know.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Trump on immigration: 2018 and todaTrump on immigration: 2018 and todastrips some Central American countries of aiand denounces the influx of migrants at the southern border his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been acting as a sounding board for internal discussions on reforms to the nation's legal immigration system.Over the course of two months a number of immigration groups and business groups have gathered at the White House to discuss a range of topics related to legal immigration including employment-based visas temporary worker programsthe Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals prograand moving toward a merit-based immigration system several sources familiar with the meetings told CNN.""The President asked the Vice President Jared and (Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen) Nielsen to lead negotiations on border security funding. They included a series a meetings at the White House with various stakeholder groups throughout the process"" a senior administration official told CNN.A separate source familiar with the meetings said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller who has often acted as the leading adviser on Trump's immigration policies is ""being consulted but is not intimately involved.""Trump seems inclined to close border despite potential chaoBrooke Rollins a senior staffer at the White House Office of American Innovation has also played a role in the meetings a meeting attendee said.The first sessions got underway in January amid the government shutdown and ran for about an hour and a half during which groups presented their thoughts and ideas for legal immigration reform. The focus was not the President's signature border wall but rather the legal immigration system said Jessica Vaughan the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies which advocates reduced legal immigration.""Most of the focus was on employment visas. Most people talked about the need for skilled immigrants although I wouldn't say there was full consensus in the room that was needed"" she said adding that Kushner appeared engaged throughout the discussion.""He asked questions; he clearly had been hearing a lot about our system and was familiar with how it works and what the issues are and he asked specific questions about specific policies"" Vaughan added.Center for Immigration Studies was one of many groups to attend meetings. Sources familiar with the discussions say the meetings have included among other attendees representatives from hard-line immigration groups such as NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform the bipartisan Latino political group League of Latin American Citizens business interest groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce National Association of Manufacturers Associated Builders and Contractors conservative groups including the Heritage Foundation as well as libertarian-leaning Koch-funded political groups including Americans for Prosperity.Two sources familiar with the White House meetings likened the conversations to those Kushner convened during his foray into criminal justice reform. Last year Kushner served as the White House's main negotiator on the policy steering a tough-on-crime president to signing the First Step Act a major bipartisan criminal justice reform bill.In 2017 prior to his most recent effort on legal immigration reform Kushner faced scrutinywhen his family touted the EB-5 immigrant investor program in Chin which has been criticized for being a pass for wealthy foreign citizens to essentially buy American green cards. The Kushners' company subsequently apologized for name dropping Jared Kushner and his White House role in pitching the program.Since the meetings got underway in January a proposal appears to be taking shape according to a source familiar with discussions. It's unclear however if and when a proposal would be released.One meeting attendee said members of Congress relayed to their organization that the White House has been in touch about working on a larger legislative plan regarding legal immigration. However further details on a plan or proposal remain unclear.The White House did not respond to requests for comment.White House is considering appointing an immigration czaThe proposal comes as the White House also considers appointing an immigration czar.Kris Kobach the former Kansas secretary of state and Ken Cuccinelli the former attorney general of Virginia who is also a CNN political commentator are among those being considered for the joba source familiar with discussions told CNThe President in recent months has indicated that he wants more people to legally immigrate to the US receiving pushback from advocates of reduced migration.During his second State of the Union address in February Trump brought it up briefly.""I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally"" Trump said.Since the address Trump has continued to publicly comment on the need for legal immigration.In his most explicit terms yet Trump he told the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board at the White House in March: ""We're opening it up. We have to bring people in. We want them to be people based on merit and we want them to come in legally. You've seen what's going on at the border.""Immigrants make up 13.7% of the US population according to the Migration Policy Institute a nonpartisan think tank. In fiscal year 2017 more than 1 million immigrants became lawful permanent residents. In 2016 there were around 2 million immigrants on various temporary visas living in the US like students and temporary workers according to the institute.In their meetings at the White House American business groups have asked the Trump administration to ease up on legal immigration to improve what they see as a worker shortage.""He knows the country needs more immigration"" one business group source familiar with the discussions said. ""Where we intersect with that is we're short a half a million workers.""But groups who support reduced immigration such as FAIR are pushing back on the idea.""We expect President Trump to do the right thing and not abandon his original promise to reduce immigration and tighten up foreign labor admissions. Healthy wage growth is key to a successful administration and a proposal built on immigration increases will undercut that"" said RJ Hauman government relations director at FAIR.""Anyone who tells the President that caving to cheap labor interests on immigration won't come at a high political cost does not have his best interests in mind.""9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.This is how many Mar-a-Lago trips could pay for budget cutThis is how many Mar-a-Lago trips could pay for budget cutPresident Donald Trump might use his Mar-a-Lago visits to golf entertain dignitaries and schmooze with his powerful friends but for his wife Melania Trump the idea is to be invisible. The private quarters are just that -- private -- and reserved for just her her husband and their son.The family compound of the Trump orbit at the approximately 20-acre estate-turned-private club nestled on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in Palm Beach Florida are relatively modest as far as their homes go according to a member familiar with the layout.The suites of rooms aren't vastly expansive in terms of square-footage -- tiny compared to the three floors of the Trump Tower family penthouse in Manhattan and a fraction of the four floors of the Executive Residence of the White House. There is a coziness to the place even if it is one of the largest estates in Florida.There is no private pool for the family no private spa no separate driveway. In fact the proximity to the rest of the guests many of whom have known one another socially for a period of time breeding the club-like atmosphere is both surprising and familial.The heavily secured area like most of the property is essentially attached to the rest of the club's facilities where members and member-guests can stroll about dine socialize frequent the vast outdoor facilities the tennis courts the croquet courts or the Beach Club.Where is Trump spending Thanksgiving?Where is Trump spending Thanksgiving?President Trump's Mar-a-Lago is the shiny penny of his wealth a sprawling example of what he has acquired the literal interpretation of showing off. He rarely leaves its confines with the exception of golfing at his club. Melania Trump is loathe to leave the grounds too it turns out and spends most of her vacation days on property secluded from the hoi polloi members mostly having quality time with her son and her parents Viktor and Amalija Knavs who also spend a decent portion of the year at Mar-a-Lago.Over the Christmas holiday the first lady spent three weeks out of the public eye at Mar-a-Lago save for the approximately four days she was in Washington and on a surprise visit to troops in Iraq. This month for spring break she has been away from Washington at Mar-a-Lago since March 19 and is scheduled to return Sunday evening. Her year is peppered with mini-breaks there too -- the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend Easter Thanksgiving.Yet like many things with Trump there remains a screen of privacy around her visits down here an oblique notion that she is off somewhere for large chunks of time away from the White House doing whatever she sees fit to do at her own pace on her own schedule unrelated to that of her husband or his priorities or habits -- an independent way of life that has become the calling card of this administration's first lady.""She has a long history with Palm Beach yes but she stays to herself for most part"" said Laurence Leamer part-time Palm Beach resident and author of ""Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump's Presidential Palace.""Leamer has long been a chronicler of Trump and his Palm Beach habits even pre-presidential and as such those of Trump's third wife.""All these ladies in Palm Beach"" said Leamer speaking generally of the overtly monied set of denizens in one of the country's wealthiest towns ""they go to Worth Avenue to shop they dress up and they pay these exorbitant prices for clothes and things and that's part of the scene. That's what they do here that's the life. But not Melania Trump.""Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort doubles feeTrump's Mar-a-Lago resort doubles feeWhen Trump departed Washington for Mar-a-Lago earlier this month her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN spring break at the property was ""an annual tradition"" for the family.There are few who would argue against Trump's fierce commitment to her 13-year-old son to provide as ""normal"" a life as she possibly can for him. As such Trump hasn't diverted from the occasions and events that have brought her down here since he was born.Grisham during the 2018 Christmas holidays which coincided with the longest government shutdown in history said something similar when pressed by CNN about the first lady's use of government funds to fly to and from Palm Beach and Washington (Air Force planes are required for the first lady of the United States per security guidelines.)""It has long been the family's tradition to spend their Christmas holiday at Mar-a-Lago. Her plans to travel with her son to their Florida home for his winter break have not changed this year"" said Grisham at the time.For many of the rich folk who ""winter"" in Palm Beach away from chilly East Coast temperatures and snow Palm Beach means parties and social clubs and nights on the town. But for Melania Trump Palm Beach is hearth-centric it's where she makes sure things are consistent where she can care take annual traditions and where she can hunker down away from the headlines and chaos.What Melania Trump should know about China's first ladSince becoming first lady Trump's Mar-a-Lago days include other additions to her usual calendar of vacation and self-care. She now travels there with at least one staff member typically Grisham whose full title is deputy chief of staff for communications.Trump and Grisham meet regularly while in Palm Beach Grisham told CNN to discuss events and off-site visits (this week Trump hosted Fabiana Rosales the wife of Juan Guaido the president of the country's National Assembly who the Trump administration recognizes as Venezuela's acting president. She also dropped in on a local elementary school to talk about bullying with the students).They also plan upcoming White House obligations (such as the Easter Egg Roll) and future travel. Trump is Grisham said in ""constant communication"" with her and the rest of her small East Wing team back in Washington.Yet there is another component of her Mar-a-Lago life that is more personal than professional; it is where Trump has lengthy one-on-one time with her husband the President.A year of glamour and gaffes: Making sense of Melania's stylDinner guests at Mar-a-Lago are used to seeing them by now. The couple huddled on the candle-lit patio during dinnertime talking sometimes for two three hours. Only interrupted by friends who come over to shake his hand or wish him a pleasant evening Donald and Melania Trump are mealtime fixtures at the club's formal outdoor restaurant often eating dinner together both Friday and Saturday nights on weekends when Trump is in town says a White House official.""What married couple spends three hours together alone at dinner?"" Leamer who has observed the Trumps on several occasions rhetorically asked. ""They're there so long other people are leaving and they're just ... there. They dine for hours. He likes a small table a four-person table so people can come over to say 'hello' but there's not enough room to invite people to join.""The cozy dinners at Mar-a-Lago might fly in the face of the oft-thought common perception the first couple are irretrievably detached.""It's extraordinary for what a public personality Trump is that part of him is very private and so is she. I am talking in the sense he and she don't necessarily like interlopers"" said Leamer. ""Trump has always got to be the center of attention so if you go to someone else's party he's not always going to be that.""When Trump does have dinner guests instances of which there have been publicly circulated photographs there is typically no more than two or three other couples oftentimes old friends from New York or members of his inner political circle. A creature of habit when he's not eating alone with Melania Trump the President isn't looking to make new friends. Nor is he looking to widen his culinary inclinations.Leamer writes in his book how particular Trump is about his vacation menu -- and how many Mar-a-Lago chefs have rotated in and out through the years. As such Melania Trump doesn't challenge the kitchen either. Though she may not eat Trump's favored blackened steaks and burgers or meatloaf she keeps her tastes simple and healthy.Melania Trump does however oversee menus for bigger family events including Thanksgiving Easter and Christmas. But for dinners à deux the focus is on the conversation not the cuisine.""Those two will go and sit at dinner and they are in the most in-depth conversations and will talk and sit there for hours literally"" a White House official told CNN confirming Leamer's account of the first couple's habits.Mar-a-Lago was one of the first places Trump took his new girlfriend then-Melania Knauss when they first started dating in late 1998 early 1999 and it quickly became one of her favorite getaways and remains so now two decade later.""Melania Trump is following a long tradition of first ladies seeking to escape the claustrophobic White House"" says Kate Andersen Brower CNN contributor and author of ""First Women: the Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies."" ""I think she's been more successful than most because there is so much going on in her husband's West Wing that she can fly under the radar more than Michelle Obama or Laura Bush ever could.""Bush had the family ranch in Crawford Texas Obama had Christmases in Hawaii and summers on Martha's Vineyard but when those first ladies vacationed it felt planned and regimented.""The Reagans had Rancho del Cielo or 'Ranch in the Sky' "" said Brower. ""But they were so attached at the hip they often went there together.""Rarely did they spend as much time apart as do the Trumps.Trump has Mar-a-Lago and in the summer when south Florida becomes sticky with heat and humidity she can also escape to New Jersey where she and her family have more private quarters within a private club the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. Trump's options are more vast her movements more mysterious and her activities when she's not working with her team more cloaked in privacy.Trump's desire to be away is perhaps more akin in terms of predecessors to Jacqueline Kennedy who would spend long weekends away from the White House at Glen Ora the 400-acre estate in Virginia horse country that the Kennedys rented.Trumps display affection during speecTrumps display affection during speecBrower writes in her book ""First Women"" ""according to Jackie's Secret Service agent Clint Hill between the summer of 1961 and the summer of 1962 the first lady spent nearly four months away from Washington. She often left on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning and would not return until Monday afternoon or even Tuesday morning.""Summers for Kennedy were spent in Hyannis Port Massachusetts where the fabled Kennedy compound was located. But Jackie Kennedy like Trump also spent time in Palm Beach for Christmas and Easter and she had a fondness for escaping to her family's estate in Newport Rhode Island where she and John Kennedy were married.Mar-a-Lago contains marital memories for Trump as well. While the ceremony was held at nearby Episcopal church Bethesda-by-the-Sea the Trumps' lavish wedding reception in 2005 was held in the club's gilded ballroom which had recently completed a $42 million renovation.Trump's six-figure couture gown helped land her the cover of Vogue magazine and at the reception dinner guests were served gold-flecked hors d'oeuvres steak and lobster and they swilled expensive Champagne. As the party spilled out into the pool area after dinner Trump changed into a white Vera Wang slip dress better for dancing which the newlyweds did until the wee hours.Mar-a-Lago also served as the backdrop for the weddings of Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump -- and more recently guests opting to hold their wedding at the club are sometimes to treated to a brief audience with the President if he's in town.But even when they're with family at Mar-a-Lago especially Donald Trump's extended clan those who observe the first lady say she and her parents and her son form their own impenetrable less approachable entity.And when she's there for her husband ""she is on his arm spectacularly dressed even if just for the members to see"" said Leamer. ""Mar-a-Lago is the one place where he feels truly relaxed he feels comfortable there -- and I think that's true of her as well.""9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

""It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed.""2020 Democrats vow to sign House reparations study billThe bill originally introduced by former Rep. John Conyers of Michigan and currently sponsored in the House by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas has emerged as a key issue for 2020 Democrats -- and an area of consensus. At the National Action Network Conference in New York last week Rev. Al Sharpton questioned one presidential hopeful after another on the measure andthe candidates vouched their support.Now Booker seems poised to emerge as the legislative leader on the issue.The New Jersey senator has previously vented frustration that the question of reparations has been ""reduced to a box to check on a presidential list when this is so much more of a serious conversation"" as he told CNN's Don Lemon during a recent town hall in Orangeburg South Carolina.""Do I support legislation that is race-conscious about balancing the economic scales?"" Booker said. ""Not only do I support it but I have legislation that actually does it.""On the campaign trail Booker has promoted a ""baby bonds"" proposal that would give each child a savings account with money added annually based on a family's wealth -- touting a Columbia University study that concluded such a program would ""dramatically reduce racial wealth inequality.""9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Barr's letter obliquely referenced evidence on both sides of the issue but did not explain it further.NYT Washington Post: Some Mueller investigators say their report is worse for Trump than Barr sayIn addition there has been frustration on the team that the Justice Department has helped shape the public perception of the report but the special counsel cannot address discrepancies between the summary and the actual findings according to another source familiar with the matter.first reported in The New York Times and The Washington PosMueller's team wrote summaries of the findings and expected more of that to be used one of the sources said.Another source with knowledge of the summaries described them as part of the confidential report that is being reviewed for release to Congress and the public. But the source strongly disputed that they were written in a way that allowed for immediate release because of sensitive information that needed to be considered for redactions.5 key questions about what the Mueller report actually saysaid Thursday in a statemenevery page of the report was marked as possibly containing information that should not be publicly released and that Barr released his letter about Mueller's main findings because of the ""extraordinary public interest in the matter."" The statement said the understanding was the report itself would be released after needed redactions and that Barr wrote the letter ""without attempting to summarize the report.""But the reported discrepancies are exacerbating concerns about Barr's handling of the Mueller report among Democrats on Capitol Hill. On Thursday afternoon House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler demandedto Barr that the attorney general publicly release the Mueller summaries ""as soon as possible"" and he requested communications between the special counsel and the Justice Department about the report.""I think that these questions just show again why we need the full Mueller report ... with all the underlying documents released"" Nadler told CNN Thursday. ""It would also answer the question of why the summaries that were allegedly prepared by Mueller's team were not released. All these questions would be answered by releasing the report. And yes I think it's inevitable that Mueller is going to testify at some point but the first thing we need is the release of the report and the documents.""Another source familiar with discussions at the Justice Department ahead of the conclusion of the report suggested that what could be at issue is the description of the evidence for obstruction that Mueller considered but was only referenced briefly in Barr's letter rather than there being any single alarming incident about obstruction that has not been disclosed. Barr in his letter included that Mueller had found evidence on both sides in the consideration of obstruction but opted in the end to not make a conclusion. Barr also included that much of the evidence on obstruction is publicly known.While the investigation was extensive with some 500 interviews Mueller's investigators did not get to talk to some key figures including the President and his son Donald Trump Jr. who would have had insights into both the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting and also how the misleading statement to the press about the meeting was crafted. Trump Jr. did testify to multiple congressional committees. His attorney has declined to comment.An administration official expressed some frustration with Democratic demands to see as much of the Mueller report as possible. The official complained that the report should not reveal information that is embarrassing about the President if he's not being accused by the special counsel of committing any crimes. That official called that possibility ""sh***y.""This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.CNN's Manu Raju Pamela Brown and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Nadler: The committee must see everythinNadler: The committee must see everythinPresident Donald Trump is blasting Democrats for trying to obtain special counsel Robert Mueller's report despite previously endorsing their goal of releasing it to the public.He is attacking Democrats for trying to do something he ostensibly supports: Letting the American people seeon Russian meddling in the 2016 election allegations of collusion between his campaign and the Russians and potential obstruction of justice.""I'll rely on the attorney general to make decisions"" Trump said Tuesday at the White House. ""But I will tell you anything that is given to (Democrats) will never be good enough. You could give them more documents than they've ever seen and it would never be good enough.""All along Trump has maintained that he'll defer to Attorney General William Barr when it comes to releasing the report and Barr has promised ""transparency."" But as Barr prepares to share the report with Congress -- a process he says could take another week or two -- it looks like Trump might be realizing the dangers of giving Democrats what they want.The President is well-known for often changing his mind and he still has time to assert more control over the process if he wants to. Trump could be giving himself an off-ramp by saying his Democratic foes will never be satisfied even if they see the nearly 400-page report.That's because Democrats are also clamoring for the underlying materials from Mueller's investigation -- an avalanche of documents readouts of witness interviews memos about search warrants and other details. If they can pry these documents loose from the Justice Department Democrats could try to use them to damage Trump's standing and keep the Mueller investigation in the news far beyond the conclusion of his investigation.Trump has singled out House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler D-New York and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff D-California two top Democrats who have threatened to subpoena the Justice Department or even take the Trump administration to court to get a copy of Mueller's original unredacted work.""There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff"" TrumpThe House Judiciary Committee voted Wednesday tofor the full report from the Justice Department. Nadler said he won't issue the subpoena right away and will give Barr a chance to voluntarily hand over the unredacted report and Mueller's underlying materials.Trump's new tack was echoed by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who said Tuesday that Democratic efforts to get the Mueller report proved that they were ""sore losers.""These comments show the new tone the White House is striking. Last month Trump surprised many when he said the report should be public agreeing with a key Democratic demand.""I don't mind. I mean frankly I told the House if you want let them see it"" Trump said on March 20 referring to theby the House of Representatives backing the report's public release. ""...Let it come out. Let people see it. That's up to the attorney general. We have a very good attorney general and has a very highly respected man and well see what happens.""He reiterated that position days later saying on March 25 that the decision to release the Mueller report was ""up to the attorney general but it wouldn't bother me at all.""An overwhelming majority of Americans agree with that point. A conducted before the investigation ended found that 87% of Americans wanted the Mueller report to be public.Mueller spent nearly two years investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether any Trump associates helped the Kremlin's efforts. Barr says the investigation did not establish that there was collusion with Russia. Barr also said Mueller didn't reach a conclusion on obstruction -- the report didn't implicate Trump in any crimes but didn't exonerate him either.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

They also want Barr to explain how he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided Trump's actions did not meet the standards for prosecuting an obstruction of justice case.Barr wrote Friday that he does not think it's in the public interest for him to summarize Mueller's full report nor does he plan to release sections in ""piecemeal fashion.""""Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own"" Barr added Friday.Barr further confirmed that the Justice Department and special counsel's team are working to redact four types of information from the report: grand jury material sensitive intelligence material information that involves ongoing investigations and ""information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.""But the redactions Barr is working on won't satisfy Democrats.House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York issued a statement Friday responding to Barr's letter by insisting that Democrats want the full Mueller report without redactions.""As I informed the Attorney General earlier this week Congress requires the full and complete Mueller report without redactions as well as access to the underlying evidence by April 2. That deadline still stands"" Nadler said.When they spoke by phone this week Nadler asked Barr to work with the committee to ask the courts to make grand jury information public according to a Democratic aide who said Barr would not commit to doing so. Democrats argue there is precedent for releasing grand jury material and the aide said they see that as the ""primary obstacle"" to making the full Mueller report public.""Rather than expend valuable time and resources trying to keep certain portions of this report from Congress he should work with us to request a court order to release any and all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee — as has occurred in every similar investigation in the past"" Nadler said. ""There is ample precedent for the Department of Justice sharing all of the information that the Attorney General proposes to redact to the appropriate congressional committees.""Georgia Rep. Doug Collins the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee accused Nadler in a statement Friday of setting arbitrary deadlines for Barr to release the report and said Nadler's demand for Barr not to redact grand jury and other information amounted to calling for ""the attorney general to break the law by releasing the report without redactions.""The Justice Department is likely to miss the Democrats' April 2 deadline though House Democrats have not yet said what they will do afterward. Nadler said he would take Barr's proposed May hearing date ""under advisement"" but also added: ""We feel that it is critical for Attorney General Barr to come before Congress immediately to explain the rationale behind his letter his rapid decision that the evidence developed was insufficient to establish an obstruction of justice offense and his continued refusal to provide us with the full report.""Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham of South Carolina meanwhile said of Barr's letter: ""I look forward to hearing from Attorney General Barr on May 1.""This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 202The fastest way to pay off $10000 in credit card debTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until nearly 202Fly practically free with these 3 travel cardGetting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent crediHow to pay off your house ASAP (It's so simple)Rates now at 3.5% APR - $225K mortgage for $1608/mNeed cash?

The announcement comes amid a broader shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and follows the arrest of a Chinese woman whoallegedly breached security at Trump’s Mar-a-LagWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump is “thankful” to Alles “for his over 40 years of service to the country.” Alles served for 35 years in the US Marine Corps retired in 2011 and held multiple positions at US Customs and Border Protection prior to becoming Secret Service director.Alles’s ouster is the latest development in personnel changes at DHS.

Zhang was charged with lying to a federal agent and knowingly entering a restricted area after entering the resort and being discovered with four cellphones a hard drive a laptop and a malware-infected USB drive. On Monday prosecutorsthey found more electronic devices and cash in Zhang’s hotel room.The Secret Service said in aafter the incident that it was Mar-a-Lago not them who decides who and who does not get into the property. Trump just last week said that he “could not be happier” with the Secret Service which has “done a fantastic job from day one.”that Alles’s ouster is not related to the Mar-a-Lago incident and an official toldthat it “was not based on any single event.” The however reports that Trump sought Alles’s resignation “in part” because of the incident.Trump had “soured on” Alles and that the director had been told about 10 days ago to come up with an exit plan for himself and devise a timeline. According to the report Trump made fun of Alles’s appearance and called him “Dumbo” because of his ears.Alles in an internal memo to the Secret Serviceobtained by Elizabeth Landers of Vicsaid that contrary to reports he was not fired. He said was told “weeks ago” by the administration that “transitions in leadership should be expected” across DHS. “It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the workforce prior to this announcement” he said.A source provides USSS director Alles’ internal memo to the Secret Service: “No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my ‘firing.’ I assure you that this is not the case...”Either way he’ll be gone soon.

Immigration: judge tells Trump to stop sending asylum seekers back to Mexico - VoLog In or Sign UJudge tells Trump to stop sending Central American asylum seekers back to MexicYet another defeat for a Department of Homeland Security stuck between the judiciary and an enraged and impatient president.Judge tells Trump to stop sending Central American asylum seekers back to MexicA federal judge ruled that the Trump administration has to stop its practice of returning some Central American asylum seekers to Mexico while their hearings are pending — a policy that has been in place since late January at the San Ysidro port (above) in California.A federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration can no longerreturn Central American asylum seekerto wait in Mexico before (and between) hearings in their asylum cases.The policy known as thepolicy has resulted in more than 600 asylum seekers being sent back to Mexico since late January — with more than 250 of those coming in the last two weeks as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) aggressively expanded its use along the US-Mexico border at the direction of former department Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.Judge Richard Seeborg of the Northern District of CaliforniInnovation Law Lab v. Nielse requires the administration to allow people who have already been returned to stay in the US after their next court hearings and to stop returning new people to Mexico under the policy.The ruling maintains that the Immigration and Nationality Act’s provision allowing the government to return migrants to a “contiguous country” while their cases are pending does not apply to asylum seekers and that the way the Trump administration was implementing the policy — returning asylum seekers until they met an unusually high standard of proving they would be persecuted in Mexico — failed to protect migrants from danger.Seeborg’s ruling comes as the department is already in upheaval. Nielsen resigned under pressure from President Donald Trump on Sunday night; Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan (who helped oversee the implementation of the “Remain in Mexico” policy) has been named her acting replacement apparently in contradiction of federal vacancies law.The other DHS official responsible for overseeing the implementation of the return-to-Mexico policy US Customs and Immigration Services Director Francis Cissna — whose agency included the asylum officers that engaged in infrequent and unusual screenings of asylum seekers who claimed to be afraid of being returned to Mexico — is reportedly under pressure from Stephen Miller a Trump aide and immigration hawk to leave as well.The new ruling is yet another setback for all of them to deal with. Nearly every major Trump immigration initiative has been put on hold by the courts — giving the administration a dwindling array of options as it tries to address the needs of the unprecedented number of families entering the United States and the ongoing temper tantrums of a president who appears to believe they can be prevented from entering.Ironically Nielsen introduced the “Remain in Mexico” policy the last time it looked like she might lose her job in December as Trump was openly contemplating replacing her in a post-midterms shakeup.When she presented the plan at a House Judiciary Committee hearing she made it seem like a central solution to the problem of asylum seekers — one that prevented them from being able to abscond into the United States before their hearings because it didn’t really allow them into the US at all.The government will almost certainly appeal Seeborg’s ruling — adding it to a long line of Trump immigration policies stuck between a West Coast judge’s injunction and the Supreme Court. It’s plausible that if the administration wanted to fight the case aggressively they could get the conservative Court to uphold the policy eventually. But it would take months or years. Trump has shown repeatedly — not least over the past few days — that he is not willing to wait that long.Rep.

College admissions fraud: 14 people including actress Felicity Huffman plead guilty in college admissions scam - VoLog In or Sign U14 people including actress Felicity Huffman plead guilty in college admissions scaThe Department of Justice announced the plea deals in a bribery and fraud case that captured national attention.14 people including actress Felicity Huffman plead guilty in college admissions scaThe Stanford logo is displayed on a track on the Stanford University campus on March 12 2019 in Stanford California. More than 40 people including actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman have been charged in a widespread elite college admission bribery scheme.Of the scores of people who allegedly took part in a wide-rangingto get the children of wealthy parents into top-ranked colleges 14 of them will plead guilty to bribery and mail fraud charges the Department of Justice announced Monday. 13 parents including actress Felicity Huffman and one former college tennis coach have accepted plea deals though their sentences are yet to be determined.In a statement Huffman said “I am in full acceptance of my guilt and with deep regret and shame over what I have done I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions.”In a statement Felicity Huffman says she’s pleading guilty.“I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.” more than 50 people including Huffman and actress Lori Loughlin were initially charged with fraud as part of “Operation Varsity Blues” a massive investigation into a college admissions fraud in which parents paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to William “Rick” Singer a Southern California business executive to facilitate cheating on standardized testing exams like the ACT and to have their children falsely designated as athletes. In some cases that even entailed paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to make coaches claim the children were being recruited to play sports for their schools.The scheme worked in two ways. Some parents paid Singer through his foundation to either have someone take their child’s SAT and ACT tests or “correct” their answers:First the Department of Justice alleges that in return for payments from parents ranging from $10000 to $75000 per test Singer paid other people — including a man named Mark Riddell who was also indicted — to either take standardized tests required for college admissions at many schools for their children or correct their answers after the fact.He also according to the DOJ used those payments to bribe teachers and ACT and SAT test administrators so they would overlook the cheating often sending those payments via the Key Worldwide Foundation.When a parent asked whether bribing test administrators worked Singer laughed and replied “every time” adding the kids “just have no idea that they didn’t even get the score that they thought they got.”Other parents paid Singer to bribe college sports coaches to “recruit” their child and get them into universities even creating fake “recruiting profiles.”The second part of the scheme is where things get even more interesting. According to the charging documents wealthy parents collectivelpaid Singer more than $25 million to get their children into top universities by bribing college coaches and administrators into designating their children as recruited athletes — when they very much were not.According to the DOJ the parents who took a tax deduction from their “contributions” to Singer’s foundation (in reality money used to bribe college coaches or pay people to take standardized tests for students) will also pay back the IRS.In addition the Department of Justice notes: “The charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud provides for a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison three years of supervised release and a fine of $250000 or twice the gross gain or loss whichever is greater.”The college admissions cheating scandal: news and update14 people including actress Felicity Huffman plead guilty in college admissions scaA modest proposal to fix elite college admissions after the scandaRep.

And counterfeits plague just about every corner of the web; according to one study done last year by the in a sample of commonly counterfeited products bought on the websites of Amazon Sears Walmart eBay and Newegg about 40 percent were fake. Now counterfeits have a new opponent: the Trump administration.Last week President Donald Trump signed aaimed at counterfeits — specifically according to the White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro against sites like Amazon Alibaba and eBay. In the memo Trump tasked the Department of Homeland Security and the Commerce Department among other federal groups with spending the next few months drafting a plan to combat counterfeits. Trump wants to hold theseby gathering data on their supply chain like tracking down the sellers and warehouses that distribute these goods.“This is a warning shot across the bow that it is your job to police these matters and if you won’t clean it up the government will” NavarroAmazon and eBay have long battled with the issue of fakes as have. Even seemingly more credible luxury sites like the Real Real have come under fire for selling fakes (the Real Real isfor allegedly allowing counterfeit Chanel products on the site).Counterfeit goods shown by customs in Bangkok Thailand.that sites like eBay and Amazon don’t do enough to combat counterfeits.for example Amazon would wash its hands of any blame about fakes on its site dismissingas the problem of third-party sellers instead. (Over half of products sold on Amazon come from sellers who use the tech giant’s Fulfilled by Amazon service. The company acts as a middleman between Amazon sellers and customers taking care of the shipping and payment process but the service ultimately allows Amazon to be protected against liability.)Swatch CEO Nick Hayek told thelast year that the watch company’s partnership with Amazon hit a wall because it failed to agree to a “commitment that Amazon proactively police its site for counterfeits and unauthorized retailers.” Meanwhile according to the research group one in three products in certain categories (like headphones and clothing) on Amazon has a review claiming the product is counterfeit. (In an emailed statement to Vox Amazon said it “strictly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products” and that it welcomes “additional coordinated support from law enforcement so we can hold bad actors accountable”).“The Amazon marketplace which operates as an ‘open market’ creates an environment where we experience unacceptable business practices which we believe jeopardize our brand” Birkenstock CEO David Kahan said in 2017 afterpulling its products from Amazo. “Policing this activity internally and in partnership with Amazon.com has proven impossible.”EBay too has been the subject ofregarding selling fakes as has. Both shopping sites have faced complaints that they don’t take enough strict measures likeand deleting obvious counterfeit listings. (In a statement emailed to Vox an Alibaba spokesperson said the company welcomed Trump’s new pursuit against counterfeits and “the attention it brings to the global fight against counterfeiting.”)Even while these companies haven’t figured out a solution to tackle counterfeits the industry has gotten more sophisticated.have said it’s nearly impossible these days to spot the difference between a fake luxury bag and a real one dubbing these products as “super fakes.” In 2017reported that some high-quality fakes are even made in the same factories as authentic luxury products.Companies like Amazon eBay and Alibaba have taken some action to fight counterfeits. Two months ago Amazon launched “Project Zero” which will allowbrands to flag and delete fake listing. Alibaba has its ownthat inspects the site for fake goods and Alibaba founder and CEO Jack MaStill critics say these companies aren’t doing enough to take on the burgeoning and sophisticated counterfeit industry and because they act as middlemen they’ve largely been allowed to avoid repercussions. The Trump administration believes backdoor profits are a factor when it comes to being lax on counterfeits; Navarro says establishing a blueprint for these companies to be held accountable could force them to toughen up.Want more stories from The Goods by Vox?Sign up for our newsletter here.This story has been updated to include statements from Amazon and Alibaba.The unsuccessful history of product placement in books from Bulgari to Sweet’N LoWhy do we need Game of Thrones Oreos makeup and Mountain Dew?MacKenzie Bezos is now the world’s third-richest womaRent the Runway will start offering kids’ clotheAmazon is releasing its own AirPod look-alikeThe absurdly high cost of insulin explaineCigna a major insurer is capping monthly insulin costs at $25.

Trump’s immigration decision slammed by 5 former military chiefs - VoLog In or Sign U5 former US military chiefs condemn Trump’s decision to cut Central American aiTrump usually likes listening to tough military people. He probably won’t listen to these ones though.5 former US military chiefs condemn Trump’s decision to cut Central American aiJames Stavridis retired US Navy admiral speaks to reporters at Trump Tower December 8 2016 in New York City. He just co-signed a letter slamming President Donald Trump’s decision to cut off aid to three Central American countries.On April 1 President Donald Trump vowed tocut off aid to three Central American countrie due to a wave of people trying to flee violence and economic devastation and enter the United States.five retired top military officerwho oversaw American operations in the region said it’s a really really bad idea.The former four-stars were all the chiefs of the military organization that orchestrates operations in Latin America and the Caribbean and served in that post at varying points throughout the previous three administrations. One retired Navy Adm. was once rumored to be in consideration as Trump’s secretary of state.According to them Trump’s decision will not stop the flow of migrants trudging northward.On the contrary it’ll only make things worse.“Improving conditions in Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador is a critical way to address the root causes of migration and prevent the humanitarian crisis at our border” the retired soldiers sailors and Marineson Monday. “Cutting aid to the region will only increase the drivers and will be even more costly to deal with on our border.”Five former SOUTHCOM commanders have released a statement condemning the Trump administration's decision to cut aid to Northern Triangle countries... (h/tLest you believe the view of these retired troops is outdated some top people in the Trump administration share it.“We also need to invest in Central America” Kevin McAleenan the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection whomTrump just named as the acting homeland security secretarin December. “[B]oth on security and the economic front in Central America we need to foster that and help improve the opportunities to stay at home.”The former military officials have a poinIt’s very unlikely that Trump will change his mind about sending aid to the “Northern Triangle” as the three countries are collectively known but he would do well to listen to the former officers.noted on April 1 US assistance has helped curb migration flows from El Salvador. More than 72000 Salvadorans were detained at the US border in 2016; in 2018 that number hovered around 32000.“The decision to cut funding contradicts the results of what we have accomplished together” El Salvador’s vice minister of justice told the Post.But Trump has preferred a more military-centric approach to safeguarding the border including sendingto the boundary with Mexico to quell what he considers to be a national emergency.The former military chiefs however say that’s wrongheaded. “We have seen firsthand that the challenges in the region cannot be solved by the military alone” they wrote “but require strengthening investments in development and diplomacy.”Trump usually brags about the toughness of America’s military brass but it’s unlikely he’ll champion the former officers openly telling him he’s failing on one of his core initiatives.Rep.

Trump’s Homeland Security purge explained - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s flailing shake-up of the Department of Homeland Security explaineA ongoing purge in an administration that can’t make policy.Trump’s flailing shake-up of the Department of Homeland Security explainePresident Donald Trump during a signing ceremony at the White House on March 5 2019.Kirstjen Nielsen’s surprise Sunday night resignatioas homeland security secretary is part of an ongoing purge of President Donald Trump’s immigration apparatus. It suggests Trump is determined to get tougher on immigration but lacks any concrete plans to do so — his administration was already being about as tough as possible within the confines of the law — beyond saying he wants to get tougher policy agenda on immigration.The shake-up started with the surprise announcement Thursday night that Trump had withdrawn the nomination for acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Ron Vitiello to run the agency on a permanent basis. White House policy adviser Stephen Miller is rumored to be advocating for the ouster of Lee Francis Cissna the current director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services.The New York Times has added more names to the list of potential targetMeanwhile Trump is attempting to nameUS Customs and Border Protection Chief Kevin McAleenan as acting DHS secretar even though the statute requires the job to go to Undersecretary for Management Claire Grady. And for the past week there’s been talk ofcreating a new “immigration czar” posto ride herd officials from across the departments of Homeland Security Justice and State aiming to better coordinate the Trump administration’s efforts to curb Central American asylum seekers.All of this adds up in theory to an even harder line from the White House on immigration. But what it amounts to in practice is not clear.Trump is upset that his administration is not halting the flow of asylum seekers. But his only alternative to his own failed tough policies is to say that we need tough policies. So officials are being fired for no clear reason. (Trump’s only idea for negotiating with either congressional Democrats or other regional governments is more bluster.)The president is frustrated about how little progress he’s making on a signature issue but also apparently unwilling to try to resolve that frustration by actually doing anything different.Asylum claims have risen sharplyUnauthorized immigration from Mexico which had been high throughout most of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations despite steady ongoing efforts to harden and militarize the border fell sharply during the Great Recession years. This coincided with a step-up in deportations that spanned the last couple years of Bush’s term in office and Obama’s first term. Consequently through the Obama years it was the case that net unauthorized migration from Mexico was less than zero — more people were leaving than coming — which became an important talking point in the immigration debate.Then in 2014 the United States began to experience a surge infamilies and unaccompanied minors coming from Central AmericThis was different from the classic illegal immigration debate in three significant ways. First the migration primarily involved people from Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador rather than Mexico. Second it primarily involved children and families rather than single men looking for work. Third and most important many migrants were seeking asylum without visas but it is not illegal to arrive at the border without a visa and make an asylum claim. In these situations the claims need to be adjudicated and something needs to be done with the people making the claims while their cases await adjudication.When Trump first took office in early 2017 apprehensions of asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border plummeted. Fear of Trump’s new tough on immigration posture was plausibly the reason and Trump did not hesitate to claim credit. But the underlying situation in Central America did not really change and even though Trump has been able to change many aspects of American immigration policy there’s nothing he can really do about the fact that people are legally entitled to make asylum claims. Consequently the number of asylum seekers began to rise again.Trump tried the family separation policcruel treatment of children might deter families from making claimBut the backlash was too severe the policy was unwound and administration officials believe they’ve apprehended about 100000 asylum seekers in March alone. The failure of Trump’s tough crackdown is now prompting a series of flailing moves aimed at halting it.Trump’s been in tantrum mode for weeksOne continuity in American policy across the Obama and Trump years has been that it makes sense for the United States to try to invest money in aid to Central American countries to try to improve living conditions in the region. The idea is that if life were better in the Northern Triangle fewer people would leave and that spending money on aid is more workable and sustainable than apprehending and monitoring huge numbers of asylum seekers.But on March 28 the news leaked that theState Department was paralyzed in actually releasing aid monebecause officials feared running afoul of Trump’s more punitive instincts. Then on April 1Trump abruptly announced an aid cutofTrump started talking frequently about the possibility that he would “close” the border with Mexic. Trump’s rhetoric about this has often seemed to imply that he believes asylum seekers are coming through someplace that’s “open” and that he has the power to “close.” The reality however is that what would be closed if you closed the border is legitimate cross-border commerce (of which there’s a lot) while having little direct impact on asylum claims.More recently however Trump has reframed this more clearly as a threat to wage economic war on Mexico unless Mexico agrees to serve as a kind of proxy jailer that prevents anyone from making their way north to the border.....Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)The problem with this idea obviously is that while shutting down cross-border trade would hurt the Mexican economy it would hurt the American economy too. It’s true that it would hurt the Mexican economy mor(the US is bigger than Mexico so the US-Mexico trade relationship is a bigger deal for Mexico than it is for the United States) so in theory this could work as a threat even if it’s a bad idea.But again the fact that a border shutdown would hurt the American economy makes it in many ways an inherently noncredible threat. Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric won him votes in America’s industrial towns but it’s unlikely to be popular if the North American auto industry shuts down because car parts from Mexico can’t make their way north while imported vehicles from Europe and Asia keep arriving at our seaports.So Trump appears to an extent to be spinning his wheels. Demanding new personnel as a substitute for actual new ideas.Stephen Miller is plotting a DHS purgA key figure in this bout of administration drama is Stephen Miller a veteran immigration hawk.Miller became well known to the press as communications director for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions during most of Barack Obama’s presidency. Back in 2013 a bipartisan group of senators crafted a comprehensive immigration bill that ended up passing the Senate with a large bipartisan majority and the backing of the president. With his caucus divided on the bill Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took an uncharacteristically hands-off approach. Sessions emerged as the de facto leader of the opposition with Miller a very aggressive spokesperson for his boss and frequently in touch with journalists covering the debate.Sessions famously became an early Trump supporter over their shared interest in immigration and Miller moved onto the Trump team as a key early staffer in his somewhat threadbare operation. Once ensconced in the White House Miller deftly switched allegiance from Sessions to Trump himself and has remained in the president’s good graces even as many other senior aides have departed the administration.was not only a major advocate of firing Nielsen but “also wants the President to dismiss the director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Lee Cissna and the department’s general counsel John Mitnick.” What’s more according to CNN at least some administration officials believe the seemingly illegal decision to elevate McAleenan over Grady as acting secretary at the Department of Homeland Security is part of an effort to force Grady out as well. Trump does not have discretion about who to designate as acting Secretary of DHS as long as the Undersecretary for Management position is filled. But Trump can fire an undersecretary any time he wants to which would then give him the flexibility to designate McAleenan.Trump is also in the midst offiring the director of the US Secret Servic which does not deal with immigration but is part of the Department of Homeland Security.But unlike in some previous Trump era personnel disputes there’s no particularly obvious policy context to this. There’s no equivalent in other words of Trump wanting US troops out of Syria and then-Defense Secretary James Mattis opposing him or of Trump’s rage that Sessions recused himself as attorney general from the Russia investigation.The president seems frustrated that people keep telling him he can’t respond to this situation by closing the borders but the pushback on that is firmest from the economic policy side of his administration not from the Homeland Security side so it’s not clear what a DHS purge will accomplish. But Trump seems unwilling to really try new ideas so he’s aiming for new people instead.Trump is all stick no carroOne oddity of Trump’s situation is that he is the one who is saying the large influx of Central American asylum seekers is a huge first-tier problem. Neither most Democrats nor Republican leaders in Congress are particularly fired-up about this subject or demanding that Trump do anything in particular.Under the circumstances one normal way for this to play out would be for Trump to come to Democrats with what he wants — legal changes to the asylum process that make it faster and easier to turn people away — in exchange for something they think is important. But in the past whenever Trump has seemed to be approaching any kind of deal with Democrats on immigration hard-liners end up scuttling it by insisting that essentially the entire restrictionist agenda needs to be part of the deal.By the same token Trump could try to offer Mexico an extremely generous package of trade and aid concessions aimed at convincing the Mexican government to handle the asylum seekers. Mexico’s president has spoken of a“New Marshall Plan” for economic development in Central America and Southern Mexicthat indicates his desire for some kind of deal along these lines.But Trump is an all-stick no-carrot kind of guy. His idea of doing a deal with Democrats was to cancel DACA protection for young undocumented immigrants and then offer to reinstate it in exchange for sweeping concessions. And he wants to get Mexico to do favors for him by threatening to hurt both countries’ economies unless they do what he wants. This incredibly punitive wildly ineffective approach to dealmaking has been ahallmark of Trump’s approach to the presidency from Day and it appears to be derived from his success as a business executive atusing his greater wealth to stiff contractors and shareholderBut in the presidency this kind of bullying doesn’t work at all as you can see from his lack of success in getting border wall money appropriated. A reasonable response to policy failure would be to try to go in a new direction but Trump seems entirely uninterested in that. So rather than rethink his approach he’s now inclined to burn through administration personnel even though shuffling the names on an org chart around isn’t going to alter any of the fundamentals of the situation.Rep.

Ilhan Omar AOC Rashida Tlaib and the silencing of women of color in Congress - VoReps. Ilhan Omar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib.Stephen Maturen; Bill Pugliano and Chip Somodevilla; Getty ImageIlhan Omar AOC and the silencing of women of color in CongresA man threatened to “put a bullet” in Rep. Ilhan Omar. It’s another example of how society wants to silence women of color.Ilhan Omar AOC and the silencing of women of color in CongresOn Saturday a New York man was arrested for allegedlycalling the offices of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and threatening to “put a bullet” in her skul. He asked Omar’s staffers: “Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood?” Then he called their boss “a terrorist.”The threat against Omar appears inspired by the rhetoric of President Donald Trump. The man arrested Patrick Carlineo Jr. told law enforcement officials that he “loves the president and that he hates radical Muslims in our government.”It’s not the first time Trump’s words have seemingly moved one of his supporters to violence: Last year for instance a man mailedpipe bombs to CNN and prominent Democrat— all of whom Trump had attacked publicly.There’s also something distinctly racial (and gendered) about the aggression directed at Omar who is black and one of the first Muslim women in Congress. She has been surrounded by controversy and personal attacks since she took office in January — attacks that are explicitly about silencing outspoken women of color.Omar first became the subject of scrutiny for criticizing the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) a pro-Israel lobbying group by making comments that many perceived as invoking anti-Semitic tropes. Though she has continued to face censure not just from Republicans but from her own party: House Democrats voted on a resolution condemning hate speech that was widely seen as a reprimand to Omar. And she has become a who has repeatedly smeared her and evencalled for her to resigAnd Omar is far from the only woman new to Congress who has been a lightning rod for controversy and personal attacks:Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has becomea new favorite target of conservative medi which has criticized everything from her policies her tweets her clothes her bank account and her working-class upbringing.Rep. Rashida Tlaib sparked controversy when she made a comment about racism during the Michael Cohen hearingsthat ignited a gross overreaction and outrage from Republican Rep. Mark Meadow who asked for Tlaib’s comments to be stricken from the record — yet another form of silencing.Ocasio-Cortez Omar and Tlaib have a few things in common: They are all young progressive women of color who took office this winter and immediately challenged conventional Washington thinking on everything from foreign policy to climate change to economics. They’ve all faced considerable backlash not only from Republicans but their own party as well. And they have all been met with a very specific reprimand: Be quiet.This isn’t something new to women of color: Studies have shown that women of color in the workplace are routinely— a trend that’s onlyexacerbated in Congress’s overwhelmingly white and male hallThat’s why the attacks feel all too familiar to many women of colo— they’re part of a long established pattern of attempts to silence those who step out of the roles society has ascribed to them.Omar Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez’s stances are certainly worth debating on ideological grounds. And were they white men making the same comments perhaps they would be. But that’s not always what’s happening.Instead these three outspoken women have become the public faces ofthe shift toward a more diverse Congresand have become a locus for the same patterns of biased behavior that researchers and experts have found women of color in leadership often encounter.As a result they have been met with aggressive and extensive calls toshut up and go away.Studies show women of color in Congress have long been marginalized excluded and silenceOmar Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez have been in office for just over three months. In that incredibly short span of time they’ve faced repeated attacks at every turn. They’ve been the subject of whispery catty anonymously sourced stories about how other members of Congress want to “rein them in” or “wrangle” them. Politico reported recently on howHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi is “wrangling” first-term memberPelosi told Politico: “You don’t want to be condescending but you also have to be courageous enough to say ‘This is how we’re going to do this’ in the right way.”Any new member introducing ideas outside their party’s mainstream might face some public backlash of course. But would they have faced the same level scrutiny if they were white men? Probably not.We know that because this is not a new phenomenon: Political scientist Mary Hawkesworth found in a 2003 study thatwomen of color in Congress were routinely silenced stereotyped and exclude and often had their authority challenged.Hawkesworth analyzed interview transcripts from 81 women in the 103rd and 104th Congresses using a piece of welfare reform legislation that made its way through the legislature as a case study. She found a pattern of “silencing excluding marginalizing segregating discrediting dismissing discounting insulting stereotyping and patronizing” women of color by white members of Congress and that these tactics were frequently used “to fix women of color ‘in their place.’”This isn’t unique to Congress either.A 2015 study of women of color at work in STEM fieldfound that 50 percent of the women surveyed reported experiencing backlash for behaviors that were viewed as stereotypically male such as assertiveness or expressing anger. A third of the women of color in the study said they were met with adverse reactions when they promoted themselves.Having studied these behaviors Hawkesworth sees the backlash against Omar Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib as merely a continuation of a long-standing pattern of silencing women of color.“Much of the uproar about the ideas of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (the Green New Deal) or Ilhan Omar (the power of special interests) replicates long-standing racializing tactics to undermine their authority and silence their voices to paint them as “radicals” and out of touch with the ‘real America’” Hawkesworth told Vox over email.“Whether casting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a ‘socialist’ with totalitarian tendencies or Ilhan Omar as a ‘terrorist’ their words are being twisted to suggest that they pose a threat to our nation — when they seek to promote more meaningful democratic practices” she added.Even when women of color aren’t explicitly being told to pipe down stereotypes help subconsciously keep their voices from being heard when it matters most.“Many people in our society are used to only seeing women of color in subservient positions and think of them in stereotypical ways: as housekeepers domestic workers babysitters service workers” Soraya Chemaly a feminist writer and author ofRage Becomes Her: The Power of Women’s Angetold Vox. “Studies show how often it is that women of color and black women are mistaken for janitorial staff in their own offices for example.”mentioned above also found that African American and Latina scientists were routinely mistaken for janitors in their own workplaces. Culturally many people subconsciously still envision leaders as white and male even if they don’t realize it.This type of implicit bias affects women of color every day. Chemaly said she has experienced this herself: While at a ceremony to receive an award recently she said “a group of men writers and editors walked over and asked me where I was going to whisk them off to next” implying that they thought she was an event staff member rather than a nominee for an award.“It just didn’t seem to occur to the man who asked the question that I could be there as a peer — and certainly not as a nominee for an award” she added. “That sort of thing happens to women of color all the time.”Even Ocasio-Cortez has said that in her first weeks on Capitol Hillshe was routinely mistaken for a staffer inter or spouse — rather than a Congress member.It’s no coincidence that Omar Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez have been three of the most scrutinized most frequently attacked new members of Congress. America is still not used to seeing women who look like them holding some of the nation’s highest offices.The hypocrisy of the backlash against Ilhan OmaThe series of controversies around Omar also epitomize a particular challenge that black women face: the risk of being perceived as anall for daring to take a critical stance and standing by it.Omar came under fire first fora tweet that was perceived as invoking negative stereotypes about Jews and mone. Several weeks later at an event she tried to clarify her earlier remarks saying that she wanted to talk about the United States’ relationship with Israel and the role that pro-Israeli lobby group AIPAC plays in that relationship — not Jewish people.For her comments about Israel and AIPACshe’s been widely criticized by her fellow members of Congress who have called her remarks anti-Semitic and evenPresident Trump who called for her to resigWould there have been so much outrage from Congress if a white man had said the same things? Unlikely. Republicans including Trump himself have a much worse problem with anti-Semitism. AsVox’s Zack Beauchamp wrote earlier this yeaConservatives have been trying to label Omar an anti-Semitesince she was elected in Novembe on the basis of. Rep. Kevin McCarthy the Republican House minority leader blasted her tweet despite havingaccusing prominent Jewish Democrats of trying to “buy” the 2018 election.once told a room full of Jewish Republicans that “you’re not going to support me because I don’t want your moneyou want to control your politicians that’s finCongress has conveniently ignored anti-Semitic remarks when they have come from white male Republican politicians like Kevin McCarthy and Trump. But when a similar — though much less offensive — comment came from a black Muslim woman both parties pounced.It wasn’t just Republicans: The criticism of Omar came from Democrats too. After she made her comments about AIPAC House Democrats introduced a resolution condemning anti-Semitism that was widely seen as a rebuke to Omar. The resolution walater broadened to include Islamophobia and white supremacy as wel after members of the Congressional Black and Progressive Caucuses pushed back on the resolution asking why Congress was punishing Omar in the age of Trump.Omar’s case is sadly not unique: She is just the latest example of outspoken black women in Congress being scoldewas widely admonished even by the leaders of her own party when she suggested that activists who see a Trump administration official in a restaurant or public place should confront them.And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) who is now running for the Democratic nomination for presidenthas been repeatedly interrupted and talked over by her male colleagueAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been chastiseby her own party for being too vocaOcasio-Cortez a rising progressive star quickly gained notoriety in part due to her active use of social media. Unlike many members of Congress who use social media accounts to post relatively staid publicist-approved updates about their comings and goings Ocasio-Cortez uses the platform to respond to critics and comment on news.several Democratic members of Congress told Politicthat they were afraid she would “” them and wanted to “rein in” her Twitter usage.  One anonymous House Democrat said to Politico: “She needs to decide: Does she want to be an effective legislator or just continue being a Twitter star? There’s a difference between being an activist and a lawmaker in Congress.”Just last week Ocasio-Cortez shared a live stream on Instagram while she answered questions from followers drank wine and assembled an Ikea desk. Many of her millennial women supporters found the live streamthe Federalist called it a “bizarre displaFox News host Tucker Carlson mocked her on his sho saying: “The AOC moment will pass. It’s too stupid to continue.”But though Ocasio-Cortez is notably prolific on Twitter she isn’t the only lawmaker who expresses their personality online.Several men in Washington — from— are prolific candid and unpredictable on Twitter. With the exception of Trump whose tweets are known to regularly send his staff scrambling none of these men has been publicly chastised for his social media usage the way Ocasio-Cortez has.When male politicians are vocal on social media they’re praised for their authenticity. When women do the same they’re mean girls who need to be reined in.“I think responses to [Ocasio-Cortez] have a lot to do with the fact that she’s young charismatic the digital native a woman of color and gives the appearance of following her own rules” says Chemaly. “In our culture we don’t give a lot of credence yet to what girls and young women say and do anywhere. I think she causes a certain amount of cognitive dissonance in her own party because of it.”Rep. Rashida Tlaib was criticized for pointing out racismTlaib a Detroit native who hasproudly displayed her Palestinian heritag immediately became the subject of controversy when she was sworn into her first term as a Congress membevideo emerged of her saying of Trump “We’re gonna impeach the motherfuckeMany of her fellow Democrats were clutching their pearls over her word choice; Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) chair of the House Judiciary Committee: “I don’t really like that kind of language.”Tlaib later faced backlash again when ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee of which Tlaib is a member. Cohen in his testimony accused Trump of being racist; Republican Rep. Mark Meadows objected to this characterization and argued that Trump had hired Lynne Patton a black woman to work for him at the Trump Organization and therefore Trump could not be racist.Tlaib’s turn to question Cohe she responded to Meadows:Just because someone has a person of color — a black person — working for them does not mean they aren’t racist. And it is insensitive that some would even say — the fact that someone would actually use a prop — a black woman — in this chamber in this committee is alone racist in itself.Meadows was immediately outraged: He called for the comment to be stricken from the record and then launched into a rant about how offended he was that Tlaib had suggested he was racist going so far as to talk about his black relatives and friends as evidence to rebut the claim (again invoking the misguided idea that simply knowing a person of color means one cannot be racist).Their exchange became about Meadows and his hurt feelings and Tlaib had to reassure him repeatedly that she was not calling him personally racist but rather noting that the action was racist.The entire incident ended up distracting from Tlaib’s original message about the subtle ways racism was being propagated in America’s legislature — a point that only a Palestinian woman and one other woman before heWe still have a long way to go in how America treats women of color in politicAs noted numerous studies havshown that women of color are used to being treated like outsiders who haven’t earned their spot; to having their authority and their credentials questioned scrutinized and even disregarded; and to being told to be quiet and wait their turn.That goes double in historically white male institutions like Congress where women of color have successfully fought their way in the door only in the past few decades: The first woman of color elected to Congress was Patsy Mink of Hawaii an Asian American who was elected in 1964 followed by Shirley Chisholm a black woman in 1968.Despite the fact that this year’s new Congress was themost diverse class in histor not much has changed: Currently 78 percent of lawmakers are white; 76 percent are male. And of the127 women serving in Congress just 47 are women of color— out of a total of 535 combined members in the House and Senate.At least on a subconscious level many women of color are still seen as relative outsiders in the white male world of Congress.Whether or not you agree with Omar Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez’s opinions ideologically they deserve to have a voice in the public debate. They are members of Congress who are pushinthe boundaries of dialogue around public policy and offering new perspectives and new ideas yet they face an inordinate amount of pressure to stay in line keep their heads down and be quiet.A woman of color who owns her power who disagrees with the party line who maybe even dares to get angry is still perceived as a threat to the white men who have traditionally controlled most of the power in Washington. This Congress might look more diverse but there is still a long way to go before it sounds that way.Rep.

"Trump tax returns: In Norway everyone’s tax returns are public - VoLog In or Sign UIn Norway you can look up your neighbor's income on the internet. That's a great idea.The case for public tax returns.In Norway you can look up your neighbor's income on the internet. That's a great idea.President Donald Trump really really really doesn’t want to give up his tax returns.top House Democrats asking that the IRS turn those returns ovesome eighteen different states considering lawrequiring that presidential and vice presidential candidates turn over their tax returns in exchange for ballot access. At this point Trump’s refusal appears to be as much about pride as anything — acting chief of stafftaunted Democrats on the issue Sunday saying “Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns they knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway which is of course what drives the Democrats crazy.”Asking that Trump give over his returns is a very modest reasonable ask. But it doesn't go far enough. Maybe everyone’s tax returns should be a matter of public record. It sounds wild but in Norway Sweden and Finland it’s the law and it works. Norway has been putting out recordsthey've been public since 190Public tax returns help reduce gender and racial pay disparities make labor markets more efficient encourage workers to bargain for higher pay prevent tax evasion and create a rich font of data for economists and other researchers. The US ought to give the idea a try.Transparency makes labor markets better for workerAn 1871 tax record from Norway.National Library of Norway via BBThe simplest case for disclosing tax returns is that letting everyone know what everyone else is earning makes the job market work better especially for workers. This stands to reason: Traditionally economic models assume ""perfect information"" and find that information asymmetries where one actor knows more than the other can cause inefficiencies and inequalities.For instance there's tons of variation inhow much airline pilots are pai. Airline Pilot Central put outthat had Delta paying pilots an average of $212.97 an hour. American Eagle by contrast paid only $82.19 per hour. Some of that may be due to differences in skill level but in many industriessome firms just do a lot better than otherand so pay their employees more than they'd earn doing the exact same job elsewhere.If those pay numbers were totally private it'd be impossible for an American Eagle pilot to see that she's making less than her peers and attempt to find work at Delta or United (which also pay very well). If that information were all public it'd be much easier for workers to make that move. If enough people did that lower-paying employers would have to bid up wages to catch up. Employers currently benefit a lot from the obscurity of pay numbers and full transparency could lead to a lot of underpaid people jumping ship.This isn't just theory. In an influential paper byUC Berkeley's David Card Enrico Moretti and Emmanuel Saez and Princeton's Alexandre Ma the authors randomly informed a subset of University of California employees about a new website with pay information. They found that while above-median earners didn't react much to the information below-median workers got pissed. They registered low job satisfaction and were likelier to look for a new job.This could lead to better matching between people and jobs. The below-median earners received information suggesting they were underperforming and rationally sought new work. It's the market working like it should. ""Their talents and abilities might be better suited to another job which would match that improved performance with better pay""notes. ""The previous employers could also then find new employees for the newly vacant positions who could better fit their mold and meet their expectations.""Card et al. were well-attuned to this implication of their finding — and to its political implications. ""In terms of workplace policies our findings indicate that employers have a strong incentive to impose pay secrecy rules"" they write. ""In terms of political outcomes our findings indicate that casting light on inequality can stir a strong psychological reaction due to feelings of fairness or envy that might then feed in political views.""In other words pay transparency provokes outrage about inequality as well asagainst inequality in the form of job hopping.It also stands to reason that making pay information publicly available helps workers combat pay gaps most notably between male and female employees but also between white employees and employees of color. After all the absence of pay information makes it hard for workers to even know a gap exists let alone agitate to reduce it.There's empirical evidence to back this up too. In recent years for just this reason a number of states have passed laws banning employers from restricting their employees' ability to discuss salaries with each other. Astudy by UMass Boston's Marlene Kifound that states with the laws saw more wage growth for women and a shrinking of the wage gap especially for women with college degrees.The Obama administration has taken a good first step inmandating that companies submit information on their pay gapto the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But that only lets the EEOC scrutinize them about this. Posting tax returns online would enable pay gaps to be scrutinized by academics think tanks media outlets average citizens etc. vastly increasing the amount of oversight and increasing pressure to fix the problem.Public taxes also make tax collection work bettePhoto by Win McNamee/Getty ImageAnother thing about pay transparency: It makes it harder to evade your taxes. Adding scrutiny from not only the tax collection agency but your neighbors and competitors makes it tougher to fudge your reported income.At least that's what economistsErlend Bø Joel Slemrod of University of Michigan and Thor Thoresefound when they examined what happened in 2001 when Norway put its public tax return database online for the first time making it far easier to access and effectively increasing transparency.""We observe income changes that are consistent with public disclosure deterring tax evasion"" they write. ""An approximately 3 percent higher average increase in reported income is found among business owners living in areas where the switch to Internet disclosure represented a large change in access."" Individual income tax revenue rose by 0.2 percent.A 0.2 percent bump may not sound like a lot but that's a sizable increase in revenue given that no taxes were hiked. In the US it'd mean about $3.2 billion more revenue a year. Not a bad deal at all.There'd also be a big research benefit to public tax records. Tax filings constitute the single best source of data we have on the economic well-being of people across the income spectrum — not only that but on what people are giving to charity on what they're paying for mortgages how much they're paying in state taxes where exactly their money is coming from etc. But that data is off-limits to most researchers.On some rare occasions the IRS and other tax agencies in countries without full disclosure have cooperated with studies and the results have been incredible. Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez's famouswas made possible by the willingness of the IRS and its counterparts in Europe to let Piketty and Saez pore through their documents. The top 0.1 percent and 0.01 percent are groups too small to capture through surveys but they were captured on tax returns.Or take Stanford economist Raj Chetty who along with his co-authors has used tax data to estimate the effectiveness ofeffect of teacher quality on adult earninghow social mobility varies across the UThis is all great important work — and there's a lot more where it came from. But because the IRS makes an effort to keep things anonymous it has limited bandwidth for this kind of collaboration. If on the other hand returns weren't anonymous any economist or sociologist could start using the records immediately prompting a surge in research productivity.This actually goes a bit further than which only releases taxes paid and income and which tells all taxpayers when their information is accessed and who accessed it. But it'd yield huge dividends for social science.In Norway you can look up your neighbor's income on the internet. That's a great idea.America’s anti-poor tax audits in one infuriating maRep.

A key point he emphasized: being gay is not a personal choice.“That’s the thing that I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand” Buttigieg said. “That if you have a problem with who I am your problem is not with me. Your quarrel sir is with my creator.”In his speech Buttigieg challenged the vice president a conservative Christian whothe Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015 which allowed business to deny service for LGBTQ members on religious grounds. He also supported the funding of conversion therapy which has been criticized as inhumane and ineffective by medical experts and activists in 2000.While directly addressing Pence Buttigieg said his marriage to his husband has not only made him a better person but has also brought him “closer to God” as well.It wasn’t the first time Buttigieg talked about religion that day: The morning of his speech Buttigieg also appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press” criticizing the hypocrisy of Trump’s Evangelical supporters for embracing a president who “is not consistent with anything that I hear in scripture or in church.” A week before he had questioned Trump’s belief in God because of the president’s lack of humility.As Democrats start picking a nominee to face off against President Trump who has the support of evangelical voters but isn’t exactly known for his piety 2020 candidates are talking more about.

"Trump tax returns: The Fight with Democrats is just starting - VoLog In or Sign UThe fight for Trump’s tax returns is just getting starteThis is going to be a long one.The fight for Trump’s tax returns is just getting startePresident Donald Trump waves as he walks to the White House in April 2019.have asked the IRS to hand over Presidentby Wednesday. The White House has signaled it has no intention of complying with the request meaning the battle over the issue is far from over.Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) who chairs the House Ways and Means Committeeput in a formal requesto IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on April 3 asking for the president’s tax returns from 2013 to 2018. He invoked an obscure 1920s law that authorizes the Ways and Means Committee to get from the Treasury Department the tax return information of any taxpayer.But it appears highly likely that the deadline will pass without Trump’s tax returns anywhere in sight. The Trump administration has signaled for months that it has no intention of complying and characterized what the Democrats are doing as an example of politicized overreach.Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney in an interview withover the weekend called the Democrats’ request a “political stunt” and said they would “never” see Trump’s returns. “They know they’re not going to get this” he said.The path ahead isn’t entirely clear once Neal’s original deadline hits but it’s likely a court battle looms though not in the immediate future. A spokesman for Neal’s office said that the path forward depends on how the IRS and Treasury Department respond to the request — if they do at all. (Neal’s office thinks the administration probably won’t respond at all because “they don’t want to have a paper trail of their own saying no.”) The likely next step will be another letter once the deadline passes and eventually Neal could issue subpoenas or head to court but he’s keeping his options open. Congress is about to go on recess for the last two weeks of April which will also slow things down. Neal told reporters last week he “wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts.”In other words the fight over Trump’s tax returns is going to last for a while.Democrats are using a 1920s law to make this requesof the Internal Revenue Code a statute dating back to 1924 which authorizes the Ways and Means Committee to request from the Treasury Department the tax return information — personal or business — of any taxpayer. Treasury theoretically has to comply and since it doesn’t look like it’s going to that’s where the legal battle would likely come in.University of Virginia law professor and former Joint Committee on Taxation chief of staff George Yin laid out the process inbefore Congress in February. He explained that congressional authority to request tax return information was added in 1924 as a co-equal branch of government; before that only the president had such authority to request and disclose tax returns:Section 6103(f) does not place any conditions on the exercise of the authority to obtain tax return information by the Ways and Means Committee. Moreover it provides no basis for the Treasury Secretary to refuse a request. I believe both features were intentional. Since the president at the time had unconditional access to tax returns Congress wanted to give its committees the same right.Congress made some changes to the law in 1976 including eliminating the ability of the president and any congressional committees not related to tax to disclose tax information to the public. But a handful of tax committees including Ways and Means can still lawfully request someone’s tax returns.Democrats have been building their case for a whilDemocrats will have a better shot in succeeding in getting Trump’s tax returns if they can build a strong case forthey want them and show that they’re pursuing them out of legislative and oversight duties not as part of a partisan fishing expedition.on his request laid out the Democrats’ argument. He said the Ways and Means committee has the responsibility to conduct oversight of the federal tax system and “determine how Americans — including those elected to our highest office — are complying with those laws.” He also said the committee needs to make sure the IRS is doing its duty in properly enforcing tax laws.The IRS has a policy of auditing all presidents and vice president and Democrats want to make sure that’s what they’re doing.Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) who has been making the case for pursuing Trump’s tax returns under Section 6103basically since Trump was inaugurate in an emailed statement to me earlier this year said he believes the evidence which indicates the president “has abused our tax laws is plentiful.” He citeda New York Times investigatiointo Trump and his family’s tax practices that suggested the family for years engaged in a number of schemes to avoid taxes andfrom Trump’s 1995 and 2005 tax returns; the 1995 ones show a nearly $1 billion loss.“Americans have a right to know if their president has paid his taxes if he has followed the law and if he is free from financial conflicts of interest” Pascrell said. “The law is clear. Under 6103 the Ways and Means Committee chairman is entitled to request Trump’s tax returns — and the Treasury secretary is obligated to deliver them. That’s all there is to it.”The White House has signaled they’ve got no interest in complyinBefore and after Democrats put in their formal request for the president’s tax returns the signal from the Trump administration has been that they’re not interested in cooperating.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin in testimony before the House of Representatives in Marchhe would seek to keep Trump’s tax returns under wraps. “We will follow the law and we will protect the president as we would protect any individual taxpayer under their rights” he said.William Consovoy Trump’s personal lawyer sent ato Treasury Department general counsel Brent McIntoch on Friday arguing against releasing Trump’s tax returns. He said that the tax code “zealously guards taxpayer privacy” and that Neal’s request “flouts …fundamental constitutional constraints.”He said the Ways and Means Committee has “no legitimate purpose” for requesting Trump’s tax returns and even if it did it doesn’t matter. “Even if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President’s tax returns and information that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal’s request” Consovoy wrote. “His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and his speech.”Jay Sekulow another personal attorney for Trump in an appearance on ABC’son Sunday also dismissed the Democrats’ request.“This idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon which is what is happening here is incorrect both as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally. We should not be in a situation where individual’s — individual private tax returns are used for political purposes” he said. He also said that the president hasn’t asked for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) tax returns.President Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow says ""if necessary"" the fight over Trump releasing his tax returns ""will be litigated.""""We should not be in a situation where ... individual private tax returns are used for political purposes"" he addsthe New York Times note Trump’s lawyers’ thoughts on the issue don’t really make much of a difference one way or the other but they’re indicative of the Trump team’s stance on the issue.Democrats getting Trump’s tax returns doesn’t necessarily mean we’ll get to see theEven if Democrats are able to get the president’s tax returns there is debate over whether they can legally be made public.If the Ways and Means Committee gets Trump’s tax returns it could then vote to have some or all of the tax returns released to the rest of the House of Representatives so all members would have access to it. But then it’s unclear if it’s legal to make that information public.Ken Kies the managing director of the Federal Policy Group testified before Congress in February that it would be afor a member of Congress or staff to publicly disclose tax returns punishable for up to five years in prison. Others however disagreed. Yin argued that if the committee votes to release them to the full House making the tax returns public would be allowed.That debate — and the conclusion to it — is still a long way away unless the Trump administration magically decides before Wednesday that they’re fine with releasing his tax returns after all. But it’s far likelier this fight is going to play out for quite some time.The news moves fast.

America’s high health care administrative costs in 2 charts - VoLog In or Sign U2 charts that show our health care administrative costs are really hig2 charts that show our health care administrative costs are really higA new report from the Center for American Progress dives into one of the key things that sets our health care system apart from those of other countries: our exceptionally high administrative costs. And it makes a case that in order to bring down those costs you actually don’t need to go all the way to single-payer.”A structural overhaul of how health care is financed and priced that includes key features of other countries’ systems — whether one payer or many — would go a long way toward eliminating excess administrative costs” co-authors Emily Gee and Topher Spiro argue.First let’s look at the numbers. As you can see in this chart the United States has administrative costs that are well above those of pretty much every other developed country.You can also break down the numbers by administrative costs associated with different types of medical visits. You can see that the average inpatient surgery includes just over $200 in administrative work.It’s not hard to understand why the American health care system has higher administrative costs. We have a highly fragmented health insurance market where each insurer sets different prices for thousands of different medical procedures. The result is a massive infrastructure to process American medical claims that exists in health insurance plans and doctor offices all across the country.The thing that’s a bit harder to figure out is the right amount of administrative costs for our country and how to get there. You’ll note in the top figure that even countries with universal coverage vary pretty significantly in what they spend on administrative costs. France is spending for example 10 times as much as Norway on administrative costs and Germany twice as much as Japan.Some administrative costs will always make sense. At the end of the day you’re going to need someone to run a health insurance system — to mail out insurance cards contract with doctors and run programs that attempt to root out fraud for example.But what’s the right number to aim for? That’s a bit harder to pin down. “Not all administrative spending is equal” Gee says. “There are certain cases where we might actually be underinvesting in administrative costs places where more administrative spending could bring down overall costs.”The other big question this report raises: What’s the best way to lower administrative spending in the United States?Supporters of a single-payer system like Canada’s would argue the answer is simple: You move to a system where the government provides health coverage to all citizens. When there is just one health plan you won’t have disparate prices for the same procedure. You will probably have some unemployed billing specialists on your hands as their jobs would no longer be needed.But Gee and Spiro make a different case. They argue that you don’t need to go as far as a single-payer system — that with some kind of all-payer rate setting you could achieve significant savings on administrative spending. In other words if you have multiple health insurers all paying the same price that does a lot of the legwork in cutting administrative costs. (It should come as no surprise thatthe most recent health policy proposal from CA where Gee and Spiro work endorses a multi-payer system that wouldn’t transition all Americans to one government plan.)”Uniform rate setting is a key feature of a system that would have lower administrative costs” Spiro says. “That could be in the context of a single-payer system or a regulated multi-payer system.”This story appears in VoxCare a newsletter from Vox on the latest twists and turns in America’s health care debate.

Bernie Sanders wants to let people in prison vote. Only 2 states do. - VoLog In or Sign UBernie Sanders wants to expand voting rights by letting people in prison votOnly two states including Sanders’s home state of Vermont currently allow people to vote from prison.Bernie Sanders wants to expand voting rights by letting people in prison votDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during a rally at the Fairfield Arts and Convention Center on April 6 2019 in Fairfield Iowa.Bernie Sanders over the weekend said that more states should let people with felony records vote while they’re in prisonKevin Hardy reported for the Des Moines Registe“I think that is absolutely the direction we should go” Sanders said during a town hall in Muscatine Iowa on Saturday after he was asked if people should be allowed to vote from prison.Sanders’s home state of Vermont which he represents as a US senator is one of two thatlets people vote while they’re in priso. Most states prohibit people from voting while they’re in prison on parole or on probation. And two — including Iowa where Sanders was speaking — bar people with felony convictions from voting even after they’ve completed their prison parole or probation sentences.“You’re paying a price you committed a crime you’re in jail. That’s bad” Sanders said. “But you’re still living in American society and you have a right to vote. I believe in that yes I do.”Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds a Republican is pushing for that to change advocating for a constitutional amendment to let people vote after they’ve completed their sentences. But the Republican-controlled Iowa Senate has blocked the proposal.Sanders isn’t the only Democratic candidate for president speaking on this issue. Last month Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) one of Sanders’s opponentsat an Iowa town hall in Storm Lake that people should be allowed to vote after they complete their sentences. “While they’re incarcerated I think that’s something we can have more conversation about” she added.As of 2016 6.1 million people were prevented from voting due to a felony conviction the Sentencing Project. But that was before Florida voters elected to let most people with felony records vote after they complete their sentences —letting more than 1 million people vote agaiSince black Americans are more likely to go to prison these laws have a disproportionate impact on black voters: While the overall disenfranchisement rate didn’t break 11 percent for any state more than 20 percent of black voters were disenfranchised in Florida Kentucky Tennessee and Virginia in 2016. have generally upheld such voting restrictions under the US Constitution’sthat the government may abridge the right to vote due to “participation in rebellion or other crime.”The voting prohibition is one of thevarious collateral consequences of priso which include restrictions on employment and bans on receiving welfare benefits accessing public housing or qualifying for student loans for higher education.So not only does prison deprive people of their freedoms while they’re incarcerated but the punishment can follow people for the rest of their lives.The extended punishment can sometimes make it much more difficult for people with criminal records to regain rights and benefits that would allow them to get a job or an education which might leave them with few options but crime to make ends meet. And since black people are more likely to be affected collateral effects may help perpetuate crime in black communities in particular.spoken out against mass incarceration since at least 199 wants to change that.Bernie Sanders is running for president in 202Bernie Sanders wants to expand voting rights by letting people in prison votThe big divide among 2020 Democrats over trade — and why it matterRep.

"Mick Mulvaney rewrites history of Trump’s comments about tax returns - VoLog In or Sign UMick Mulvaney rewrites history claims Trump never promised to release his tax returnThe White House wants you to forget that candidate Trump repeatedly promised to release his tax returns.Mick Mulvaney rewrites history claims Trump never promised to release his tax returnMick Mulvaney on Fox News.The White House might want you to forget about it now but before and during the 2016 presidential campaign Donald Trump repeatedly promised to release his tax returns.that if he “decide[s] to run for office I’ll produce my tax returns. Absolutely. I would love to do that.” In 2015 — months before launching his presidential campaign — Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt“I would release tax returns ... I have no objection to certainly showing tax returns.”Candidate Trump reiterated that vow during the first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton with a now-familiar caveat “I’m under a routine audit and it’ll be released and as soon as the audit is finished it will be released.”Trump of course never followed through. He continues to cite an audit that seems poised to outlast any of our natural lifetimes as the reason he won’t release his tax returns. But now that House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA)has formally asked the IRS to turn them ove the White House is pretending like Trump never said he’d release them at all. acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney vowed that Democrats will “never” see Trump’s tax returns and characterized the issue as one “that was already litigated during the election.”“Voters knew Trump could’ve given his tax returns they knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway” Mulvaney said.Mick Mulvaney shamelessly gaslights about fact that Trump repeatedly promised he would release his tax returns during the campaig""That's an issue that was litigated during the election. Voters knew Trump could've given his tax returns he didn't &amp; they elected him anyway""But that was not what Trump told voters. He promised them he would release his returns pending completion of an audit — not that he wouldn’t do it at all.Not only was Mulvaney rewriting history about Trump’s past statements on his tax returns but he downplayed the interest Americans have in seeing his returns. Aconducted in January found that 60 percent of people want the new House Democratic majority to do what it’s now trying to do: obtain them.The White House isn’t cooperatinThe IRS routinely audits the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents. Neal framed the request he made to the IRS for Trump’s tax returns around an interest in making sure the government is doing its job.“The IRS has a policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice-presidents yet little is known about the effectiveness of this program” Neal wrote inreleased after he formally requested Trump’s tax returns. “On behalf of the American people the Ways and Means Committee must determine if that policy is being followed and if so whether these audits are conducted fully and appropriately. In order to fairly make that determination we must obtain President Trump’s tax returns and review whether the IRS is carrying out its responsibilities.”already signaled that he won’t cooperate with Neal’s reques. On Friday an attorney representing the president William Consovoy sentto the Treasury Department objecting to Neal’s request on the grounds that “[i]t would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack harass and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandora’s box is opened the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.”Unsurprisingly Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hasalready indicated he’ll block Democratic effortto obtain Trump’s tax returns which sets the stage for the matter to be fought in the courts.Mulvaney seems to reflect other Republicans’ sentiments on this issue. During an interview on Sunday’s onetime Trump critic Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) called Neal’s efforts “moronic” and opined that “[t]he courts are not going to say you can compel a person running for office to release their tax returns. So he’s going to win this victory. He wins them time after time.”WATCH: Sen. Mitt Romney says ""I'd like the president to follow through and show his tax returns"" but thinks Democrats are playing into his hands.: ""Going after his tax returns through a legislative action is moronic. That's not going to happen""— Meet the Press (@MeetThePress)Like Mulvaney Romney’s comments represented a bit of a reversal from the 2016 campaign when he said Trump’s tax returns likely contained a “.” (When Romney was the Republican nominee for president he doing so interestingly afterformer Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested the Republican might have something to hid“The reason that I think that there’s a bombshell in there is because every time he’s asked about his taxes he dodges and delays and says well we’re working on it” Romney said during a Fox News interview in February 2016. “I think there’s something there.”The news moves fast.

Howard Schultz town hall: one bad idea - VoLog In or Sign UHoward Schultz only has one idea about politics and it’s baMaking him president won’t fix the problems of partisanship.Howard Schultz only has one idea about politics and it’s bahave any specific ideas about American public polic despite the Starbucks CEO’s evident aspiration to be president of the United States.But he does have a big idea about American namely that the poisonous spirit of partisanship is preventing America’s elected officials from governing the country effectively. And while this is a bit of a platitude it’s not just a platitude. It really is true that there are two faces to political life. One is a zero-sum competition for electoral power and the other is a policymaking process that is decidedly not zero-sum. Two groups of people even groups with very different goals and ideas can often strike bargains that advance both sides’ interests.Schultz observes for example that if all the relevant political actors just totally forgot about their partisan interests they could almost certainly come up with a solution to the border situation that is superior to the status quo.The border crisis can be solved. If we put partisanship aside and lived our American values and common humanity we can secure the border offer a fair path to legal status and create a better visa process for our country and economy.But of course the premise of Schultz’s presidential campaign is that electing Howard Schultz president would somehow fix this. But how? He never tries to explain because it doesn’t make sense.After the town hall Schultz went on Twitter to remind us of the frustrating reality that well-known and broadly popular immigration reform ideas keep dying in Congress. The details of these comprehensive reform packages differ but the basic framework is always the creation of legal status and a path to citizenship for the majority of long-settled unauthorized immigrants plus new money for border security plus forward-looking changes to immigration policy to try to better match America’s visa-granting habits to its economic needs.But why have lawmakers failed to enact these proposals?Well not because there was never a president who wanted Congress to enact them. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama pushed for immigration reform along these lines and both times it fell apart due to congressional squabbling. It’s true that Donald Trump does not support such a compromise approach and that replacing him with someone who does would be a good idea. But reform didn’t fail in 2007 or 2013 because we lacked a pro-reform president.If you want a comprehensive immigration reform bill to pass you need to take on the locus of actual opposition — congressional Republicans — and either beat them or change their minds.Putting Schultz in the White House won’t change anything. Of course putting Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris in the White House won’t change anything either. But Sanders or Harris or Beto O’Rourke or Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren or any other Democrat can be expected to work to elect Democrats down ballot which would address the issue. Schultz is just positing that his ascension would cause a chorus of kumbaya to break out and everyone will agree. The truth however is the opposite. Precisely because of the low partisanship that he deplores nobody is going to want to cooperate with him.Governing happens by and through partieRight now Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats are aiming to pass a variety of bills that they think are both popular and good ideas. Their hope is that by passing these popular progressive bills they will create a problem for Republicans who either need to give in to Democrats’ ideas or take unpopular votes that will make them easier to beat.Mitch McConnell’s predictable countermove however is to simply decline to schedule any Senate votes on Democrats’ popular bills thus getting his members off the hook. This is obviously a bit of a cynical move but by McConnell standards it hardly shocks the conscience — it’s just what party leadership looks like.Schultz’s plan to fix it is to say that ... McConnell shouldn’t do that.Instead of the Senate shutting down every proposal put through by the House we should be putting people over party and focusing on getting things done.Now Schultz is obviously right that in some sense this is a bad dynamic. Voters would be happier almost by definition if moderate Senate Republicans would just agree to support House Democrats’ most popular ideas and then moderate House Democrats would in turn agree to support Senate Republicans’ most popular ideas. But party cartel dynamics prevent this from happening as Schultz himself notes on Twitter.So how does electing him president solve this problem? Well it pretty obviously doesn't. It’s as if I showed up to a meeting about how to increase Starbucks sales and then started offering all my complaints about the pacing of season seven of— totally unhelpful no matter how accurate the complaints may be. But it’s really worse than that. As Schultz keeps saying governance in the United States is very bound up with partisanship. If you had a nonpartisan president that wouldn’t change that dynamic. It would simply mean the new president had no allies in Congress and no ability to get things done the opposite of a cure for gridlock.Maybe Schultz should do something about it?The tragedy of the situation is that while the average citizen has little ability to actually influence these underlying pathologies a rich and somewhat famous business executive like Schultz really could.He could back third-party challengers to safe-seat House and Senate members for example. One or two such successful campaigns would alter the incentive structure facing the people who actually dominate the party caucuses and create the gridlock dynamic he deplores. He could also put money behind efforts to curb gerrymandering and block ballot access.But perhaps even more usefully than backing such efforts personally he could try to persuade his fellow members of the CEO class that it’s against their long-term interests for the United States to have such a broken and gridlocked political system. In practice the bulk of corporate America seems broadly satisfied with gridlock because it protects a status quo that benefits the wealthy and powerful.But instead of trying this or anything else that might possibly work Schultz’s one idea is that he personally should be president of the United States even though by his own diagnosis this won’t do anything to fix the problems he’s identified.The 2020 presidential election: announcements news and updateHoward Schultz only has one idea about politics and it’s baTim Ryan is running for president.

Acting homeland security secretary: Kevin McAleenan vs. Claire Grady - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s possibly illegal designation of a new acting homeland security secretary explaineTrump’s possibly illegal designation of a new acting homeland security secretary explaineSunday night President Trump announced his intention to designate Kevin McAleenan the current head of US Customs and Border Protection as the acting secretary of homeland security after Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation.But legal experts question whether he has the authority to do that.As we’ve seen with earlier Trump vacancies the president typically has broad latitude to designate any Senate-confirmed official he’d like to serve in an acting role. Previous presidents have typically stuck with fairly intuitive chain of command principles in these situations and Trump’s tendency to deviate from that norm has but Trump so far has always come out ahead.....I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner will become Acting Secretary for. I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)In designating McAleenan though he appears to be on dicier legal footing according to a number of observersincluding Stanford law professor Anne Joseph O’Connel an expert on vacancies.from the statute governing the Department of Homeland Security which contains language that overrides the Federal Vacancies Reform Act the law that typically dictates appointing acting officials. The statute states that if an acting secretary is needed because of a vacancy in the secretary of homeland security position the undersecretary for management becomes the acting secretary:(1)Absence disability or vacancy of Secretary or Deputy SecretarNotwithstanding chapter 33 of title 5 the Under Secretary for Management shall serve as the Acting Secretary if by reason of absence disability or vacancy in office neither the Secretary nor Deputy Secretary is available to exercise the duties of the Office of the Secretary.Notwithstanding chapter 33 of title 5 the Secretary may designate such other officers of the Department in further order of succession to serve as Acting Secretary.The Secretary shall notify the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives of any vacancies that require notification under sections 3345 through 3349d of title 5 (commonly known as the “Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 199Under this read of the plain language Claire Grady the undersecretary for management is now acting secretary of homeland security and Trump has no discretion in the matter.It’s not clear this is importanFans of Trump-era legal controversies may recall that we’ve had two bouts of litigation about vacancy designations earlier in the Trump administration:When Richard Cordray resigned as director of the Consumer Financial Protection BureauTrump tapped Mick Mulvaney to serve as acting directowhile Democrats argued the acting job should go to Cordray’s deputy.Jeff Sessions he designed Matthew Whitakeas acting attorney general thus bypassing Rod Rosenstein and other higher-ranking officials.In both cases Trump successfully argued that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act — with its broad delegation of discretion to the president — is the controlling statute and that agency-specific language designating a succession order is just a default that the president can override at will. The homeland security case is different because the statutory language specifically designated the undersecretary for managementFVRA suggesting that in this case the president really has no choice.But another big difference in this case is that it’s not clear this is important.The CFPB litigation was about partisan control of the agency. Cordray was an Obama appointee with a term that extended into Trump’s time in office. Democrats were trying to keep the agency in the hands of a Cordray loyalist rather than turning it over to Trump’s band of merry deregulators.And the DOJ litigation was fundamentally about special counsel Robert Mueller. Rosenstein was known to be protective of the Mueller inquiry — in fact he appointed Mueller in the first place — and Trump bypassing him in favor of a lightly qualified loyalist was seen as an effort to gain control over Mueller.In the case of McAleenan versus Grady by contrast there are no particularly obvious policy stakes. They are both more or less homeland security professionals (his background is in airport stuff hers in the Coast Guard) who were tapped for political positions by John Kelly and presumably align well enough with Trump philosophically to still be around in important jobs.Even to the extent that therepolicy differences between them there’s no equivalent to the special kind of Mueller oversight role or big question about which party runs an agency in play.No matter who serves as acting secretary it’s going to be Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security — for better or worse.Trump White House firings resignations and ousterSecret Service director is the latest casualty in DHS shake-uTrump’s possibly illegal designation of a new acting homeland security secretary explaineHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation explaineRep.

"Mueller report: What we know about the obstruction of justice case against Trump - VoLog In or Sign UWhat we know about Mueller’s case against Trump on obstruction of justicRecent leaks suggest tension between Attorney General Barr and members of Mueller’s team.What we know about Mueller’s case against Trump on obstruction of justicAttorney General William Barr departs the White House on February 15 2019.Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty ImageSerious tensions appear to be emerging between members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s team and Attorney General William Barr on obstruction of justice.Mueller team members have told associates their evidence against Trump on obstruction is “alarming and significant” per the. Some of them feel Barr’s letter to Congress didn’t properly describe “derogatory information”the report includes new material that’s not publicly known.Yet Mueller’s report did not say whether or not Trump’s conduct qualified as criminal and Barr then declared that per his review of the evidence it did not.But the recent leaks suggest Mueller team members think Barr’s assessment was too benign — and that there’s more to the story.One possibility of what’s going on is that Mueller’s team outlined an extensive pattern of troubling behavior from Trump that raised obstruction concerns but that Barr concluded there was no one incident that qualified as slam dunk” obstruction of justice. And in fact since the obstruction debate began legal experts have disagreed on the strength of the publicly known evidence — some told Vox the casesaid it wasn’t quite therThere could be other reasons for the disagreement; for instance Barr could be taking an extremely generous view of Trump’s intent. We won’t know for sure until Mueller’s fuller report is released.But to understand the increasingly contentious debate over whether the president obstructed justice it’s worth reviewing what we already know Mueller investigated. From that it’s easy to see how some prosecutors may have concluded there was an extremely obvious pattern of obstruction of justice from Trump — while others may have thought there was no one example strong enough to justify a charge.1) Trump’s interactions with James Comey regarding “loyalty” Michael Flynn and the Russia probIn the months before Trump fired James Comey the then-FBI director documented a series of interactions with the new president that he found troubling.On January 27 2017 Trump had Comey over for dinner at the White House. According to Trump asked for his “loyalty” and told him “I need loyalty.”On February 14 2017 the day after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned Comey attended a briefing at the White House. When it was over Trump made clear he wanted everyone but Comey to leave. According to Trump said he wanted to “talk about Mike Flynn” and said “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go.” Comey interpreted Trump to be referring to an FBI investigation into whether Flynn made false statements about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.On March 30 2017 Trump called Comey. According to Trump complained about the FBI’s Russia investigation calling it a cloud over his presidency asking what could be done to lift the cloud. Trump also inquired whether Comey could publicly state that Trump himself wasn’t under investigation (which was to be fair something ComeyOn April 11 2017 Trump called Comey. According to Trump complained about the Russia investigation and the “cloud” again and again asked whether Comey could publicly state that Trump wasn’t personally under investigation.All of these seem to be efforts from Trump to get the FBI director to do his bidding. The most legally problematic of them may be Trump’s request that Comey drop the Flynn investigation.have argued that this could be characterized in a more defensible way: as a recommendation of prosecutorial discretion from the head of the executive branch. Barr himselfin a memo he wrote last year before his appointment as attorney general. Yes recent norms dictate that a president shouldn’t get involved in investigations but does that mean such a thing is illegal?2) Trump’s decision to fire Comey and whether it was an attempt to obstruct the Russia probThe act that prompted Mueller’s appointment in the first place was Trump’s decision to fire Comey.Although the White House claimed Comey was fired due to his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation questions immediately arose about whether Trump’s true motivation was to try to obstruct the Russia investigation.The weekend before Trump fired Comey the president had White House senior adviser Stephen Miller draft a letter to Comey blasting the Russia probe as “fabricated and politically motivated”per the New York Time. The letter was never sent.On May 8 2017 Trump called Sessions and Rosenstein to the White House to discuss firing Comey. Trump gave Rosenstein Miller’s letter and Rosenstein said he would write his own memo. “The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax when will this taxpayer funded charade end?”The next day May 9 the White House announced Comey’s firing. In doing soa memo from Rosenstein criticizing Comey’s handling of the Clinton email case a letter from Sessions recommending Comey’s removal. They also released a letter from Trump making public that Comey had told him “on three separate occasions that I am not under investigation.”On May 10 2017 Trump had a private meeting with Russia’s ambassador and foreign minister in the Oval Office. “I just fired the head of the FBI. He was crazy a real nut job” Trump said according to a document. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off” he added.Trump told NBC’s Lester Holthat he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein’s recommendation. “And in fact when I decided to just do it I said to myself I said ‘You know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story’” he said. The statement appeared to directly tie the Russia investigation to Comey’s firing.The evidence seems clear that displeasure with the Russia investigation was at least part of Trump’s motivation in firing Comey. The potential defense from the president’s team though is that this doesn’t necessarily show Trump had corrupt intent aimed at covering up wrongdoing. Rather Trump could have fired Comey because he sincerely believed the Russia investigation was an unfair witch hunt. Beyond that Barr’s 2018 memothat the president has the power to fire the FBI director so that this can’t be an obstructive action.3) Trump’s pressures on Jeff Sessions and other officialBeyond just Comey Trump’s contacts with Justice Department and intelligence officials regarding the Russia probe also came under scrutiny. For instance the special counselwanted to ask Trump many questionabout his treatment of Jeff Sessions.On March 1 2017 thethat Sessions had a meeting with the Russian ambassador that he didn’t disclose during his Senate confirmation hearing. Public pressure on Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation ensued.Around this time Trump instructed White House counsel Don McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing himself. But it didn’t work — on March 2 2017 SessionsTwo days later Trump told Sessions that he should reverse his decision during a private conversation at Mar-a-Lago. (Sessions did not do so.)On May 17 2017 when Trump got the news that Mueller had been appointed as special counsel he called Sessions an “idiot” and said he should resignSessions then submitted a resignation letter. Trumpheld onto it until May 31 2017but then returned it to Sessions — rejecting the resignation.But in late July 2017 Trump turned his attention to Sessions again. The president began mocking and berating his own attorney general in tweets and calling his recusal “that Sessions wasn’t looking into “Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes.”Around the same time TrumpWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus to get him Sessions’s resignation. Priebus apparently failed to do so and Trump ended up firing Priebus shortly afterward.The special counsel may have been probing whether Trump was trying to force Sessions out so he could appoint a replacement who would fire Mueller. Of course Trump eventually did fire Sessions — but much later and his replacement did not fire Mueller.Mueller’s team also interviewed Trump’s top three intelligence officials about their interactions with him.In March 2017 after Comey confirmed that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign’s Russia ties in congressional testimony Trump reached out to CIA Director Mike Pompeo Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and NSA Director Mike Rogers.for help supporting his public narrative of “no collusion” with Russia. Trump also asked Coats to try to get Comey to stop investigating Flynn.Finally Mueller even investigated an attempt by Trump to fire ... Mueller himself.In June 2017 just weeks after Mueller’s appointment Trump told McGahn that he wanted Mueller firedaccording to the New York Time. However McGahn did not carry out the order.Again we have a pattern of behavior in which Trump expresses great displeasure about the Russia investigation to key officials and in which he seems to be trying to get officials to bend to his will. But do these complaints and occasional (aborted) actions rise to the level of criminal obstruction of justice?4) Trump’s interactions with Russia probe witnesses and defendantMueller has also dug into Trump’s interactions with potential Russia probe witnesses. He’s explored whether Trump dangled pardons to keep associates loyal Trump’s involvement in crafting false or misleading statements issued by key figures and Trump’s attacks on hostile witnesses.In April 2017 two months after Michael Flynn’s ouster as national security adviser Flynn told associates that he had gotten “a message from the president to stay strong”according to a report by Michael IsikofAt some point in 2017 before Flynn and Paul Manafort had been charged by Mueller Trump lawyer John Dowd was in contact with lawyers for both men — and “broached the idea” that they could be pardonedper the New York TimeOn July 8 2017 Trump’s team strategized over how to respond to questions from the New York Times about a meeting Donald Trump Jr. had had with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in 2016. President Trump thena statement for his son to release — butwas highly misleading claiming the meeting was about Russian adoptions. In truth Don Jr. agreed to the meeting in hopes of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton said to be coming from the Russian government.The next morning White House communications director Hope Hicks had a call with the president and Mark Corallo a spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team. On the call Hicks said that Don Jr.’s emails revealing the true purpose of the Trump Tower meeting “will never get out”. (They got out two days later.)In August 2017 Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen sent a letter to congressional committees several multiple false statements about talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow that had taken place during the campaign. Cohenabout how Trump’s legal team reviewed his testimony in advance and said he interpreted some statements by Trump as suggestions he should lie.Trump has also repeatedly attacked witnesses that could be hostile to him in the investigation such as James Comey and Comey’s deputy Andrew McCabe. He has for instance demanded that the Justice DepartmentMuch depends on the facts here. It’s not clear for instance why Trump telling Don Jr. to give a false public statement would necessarily be considered obstruction — lying to law enforcement officials is a crime but lying to the public isn’t.We won’t know more until we see what Mueller found but the debate may not go away even theAs you can tell there’s ... a lot of potential evidence here. But does it add up to criminal obstruction of justice? Barr evidently maintains that it didn’t and Mueller didn’t say one way or the other.This may reflect a divide among legal experts that’s been evident for some time. Some have long viewed the public evidence against Trump as quite strong. “If Trump exercises his power — even his lawful power — with a corrupt motive of interfering with an investigation that’s obstruction” Lisa Kern Griffin an expert on criminal law at Duke University told my colleague Zack Beauchamp. “The attempt is sufficient and it seems to be a matter of public record already.”. Some pointed to the president’s unique role (as Barr did in his memo). Others maintained that Trump’s known acts simply weren’t as clear-cut examples of obstruction as say urging witnesses to lie under oath or destroying evidence. “This is not yet the type of case we’d ordinarily see an [obstruction of justice] indictment come out of” Laurie Levenson a former prosecutor and law professor at Loyola University told me last year.Another potential clue in Barr’s letter is what he writes about the president’s intent. “Corrupt intent” is one of the three requirements Barr says must be proven for an obstruction offense — and Barr says that in his view the failure to establish an underlying crime from Trump related to Russian interference suggests Trump’s intent with the many above actions may not have been corrupt. It’s not clear whether Mueller shares this assessment though recent reports suggest some on his team don’t have such a rosy view.There’s much we still don’t know about what Mueller found and how both he and Barr reached their respective conclusions. But with Barr saying he expects to release a redacted version of Mueller’s report by mid-April we’ll know more soon enough — and the American people will get to make up their own minds about whether the president is an obstructive crook.Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation: news and latest updateWhat we know about Mueller’s case against Trump on obstruction of justicSenate Republicans keep blocking a resolution to make the Mueller report publiRep.

"Kirstjen Nielsen: homeland security secretary’s resignation explained - VoLog In or Sign UHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation explaineNielsen was the most aggressive DHS secretary in history. It wasn’t enough for Trump.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation explaineHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned Sunday night after a relatively short tenure as arguably the most aggressive secretary in the department’s short history — a stint that will most likely be remembered for theof late spring and early summer 2018 that resulted in theseparation of thousands of familieattempting to cross at the US-Mexico border.But having the most hawkish DHS secretary in memory appears to not have been enough for Trump who is enraged over the number ofCentral American families and asylum seekerscoming into the United States.Trump’s ongoing anger already led to the abrupt withdrawal of the nomination ofacting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiellon Thursday night. Friday morning the president told reporters that he wanted to go in a “tougher direction.”Nielsen resigned after a conversation with the president Sunday afternoon making clear that the “tougher direction” is extending to a new DHS secretary. Kevin McAleenan the head of Customs and Border Protection will serve as acting DHS secretary until a formal successor is nominated.With nearly 100000 migrants apprehended by Border Patrol agents along the US-Mexico border in March Trump is ruminating angrily and obsessively over immigration riffing in speeches about telling migrants “we’re full” and “go back.”Nielsen couldn’t make that happen because it’s impossible. The US can’t even with a wall physically prevent the entry of unauthorized immigrants to the US. And once on US soil they have certain rights — including the right to request asylum.Kirstjen Nielsen has done more than any of her predecessors to crack down on immigration. And with Trump’s Friday comments about a “tougher” direction it’s hard to escape the conclusion that Nielsen is the first DHS secretary to leave because the president thinks she hasn’t done enough.Nielsen was the most aggressive immigration hawk in DHS history. Here’s what she did.To Trump’s critics Nielsen will likely be remembered for presiding over the widespread separation of children from their parents at the US-Mexico border in late spring and early summer 2018 under a “zero tolerance” policy of prosecuting first-time border crossers for illegal entry.who were separated when a federal judge ordered reunification in late June 2018 have since been reunited though arguments continue about what to do with the unknown number of families who weren’t initially covered by the 2018 order because the children had already been taken from government custody and placed with sponsors (usually relatives) in the US.But viewing Nielsen’s tenure through the lens of family separation — the rare policy on which Trump backed down instead of doubling down — risks drawing precisely the wrong conclusion. She isn’t leaving because she was too tough on immigrants for Trump. She’s leaving less than 72 hours after Trump said he wanted to go in a “tougher direction” with his immigration policy.The question is whether Trump means simply rhetorically tougher or whether he is genuinely in denial about the reality that Nielsen was in terms of policy as tough as he is likely to get.Under Nielsen the Department of Homeland Security has taken several unprecedented steps to crack down on asylum and migration at the southern border. Some of them have been held up in court; others remain in effect:“Zero tolerance” the policy that created family separation:Nielsen signed the memo endorsing zero tolerance and acknowledging that family separation would be the ultimate consequence. (Documents later uncovered bySen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR)’s officshowed that in December 2017 administration officials were arguing for zero toleranceit would result in family separation.) She didn’t pilot the practice — that happened under predecessor John Kelly — but she instituted its widespread use.Sending troops to the border:Nielsen formally made the request for the deployment of thousands of National Guard units andactive-duty military to the borde(many for no obvious purpose) and for billions in emergency funds for the construction of Trump’s border wall.She presided over this policy in late 2018 that culminated in Border Patrol agents firing tear gas canisters into Mexico during a migrant march hurting children and parents.Attempting to block migrants who enter illegally from seeking asylum:Nielsen presided over the Trump administration’s effort to ban people who crossed into the US between ports of entry — committing the misdemeanor of illegal entry — from seeking asylum. That ban whilequickly put on hold by a judg would have affected the overwhelming majority of current migrants.At the same time DHS routinized the practice oflimiting the number of people allowed to present for asylum legallNielsen also appears to be the architect of the) under which hundreds of Central American asylum seekers have been sent back to Mexico to wait for their U.S. immigration court dates. The policy which rolled out slowly in January but has expanded rapidly in the last few weeks is the closest thing the Trump administration has done to fulfilling Trump’s threat of “We’re full go back.”And Nielsen has presided over new records in immigration detention. Despite Congress telling DHS repeatedly to reduce detention to stay within its budget the number of detained immigrants has grown nearly 25 percent — fromslightly over 40000 in fall 2018Trump wants a crackdown — but it’s not clear what the next secretary could dNielsen’s tenure as secretary was defined not only by these actions but by the force that motivated all of them: the building frustration and rage of Donald Trump at the fact that people continued to enter the US.During the first few months of 2017 apprehensions at the US-Mexico border plummeted from what were already historically low levels of border crossings. Trump took personal credit and held it up as proof that all it took was a tough-talking president to secure the border once and for all.He was half-right and he’s been bedeviled by the other half the “once and for all” part ever since. Because Trump decided to measure the success of his immigration policy in whether or not people were trying to enter the US at all — not in how many were being deported or allowed to stay or anything else — he set himself up for failure.It really does appear that the early 2017 lull in apprehensions was a reaction to Trump taking office. But people both within and outside the government understood at the time that the absurdly quiet border of Trump’s first months wouldn’t last because for a year — through Kelly’s tenure and the beginning of Nielsen’s — tough talk was all the Trump administration had to offer.This wasn’t a failure of political will on Kelly’s part. It was a belated reckoning with reality: The low-hanging fruit of deterrent immigration policies had been picked a long time ago.US immigration law is a balance between the desire to minimize unauthorized entry into the United States and the desire to protect vulnerable people who may be fleeing harm and persecution. Both US and international law prohibit the US from refusing entry to people who are in danger of prosecution in their home countries; both US statute and court settlements offer extra due-process protections to asylum seekers children and families.Trump’s anger at Nielsen is really anger at this delicate balance. For the past year the US has tried to do as much as it can to push policy toward enforcement over protection with the political and legal resistance that might be expected when tough problems are met with blunt solutions.But its ideas — at least the ones that haven’t yet been struck down in court — haven’t been enough.The administration hasn’t yet been able to find a way to guarantee that someone who comes to the US without papers has no chance of staying. Short of that no policy crackdown will persuade someone desperately fleeing her home country that it’s not worth it to try to come to America.And mass deterrence — fewer people getting caught by Border Patrol because fewer people want to set foot in the US without papers — is the only outcome Trump has set himself up to accept.Trump’s new favorite tropes — the idea that the US needs to “get rid of judges” (which doesn’t reflect immigration hawks’ actual frustrations with the asylum system) and should just start telling migrants they can’t come in — simply don’t reflect a policy that a future homeland security secretary coulIf Trump wants a DHS secretary who looks the part of a law enforcement official McAleenan — a career border officer — is a better fit. If he wants someone who can talk tough in front of the cameras McAleenan might nobe a good fit for exactly the same reasons; he hasn’t been as willing to blame either Democrats or migrants themselves for the current situation at the border as other Trump officials including Nielsen.Trump could nominate someone more rhetorically aggressive like occasional adviser Kris Kobach but he could face an uphill battle in the US Senate.But if Trump wants a DHS secretary who will stop people from setting foot on US soil none of these options will satisfy him. Neither will anyone else.Trump White House firings resignations and ousterSecret Service director is the latest casualty in DHS shake-uHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s resignation explaineScott Gottlieb was the most aggressive anti-tobacco FDA leader in years.

That attack threatens to reinvigorate the armed conflict in a country marred by instability since former dictator Muammar Qaddafi was deposed in 2011.The LNA is led by Gen. Khalifa Haftar who fled to the US after his first failed coup attempt against Qaddafi. Haftar launched the latest attack in hopes of fulfilling a promise to unite Libya under his control.Standing in his way are armed factions defending the capital and its internationally recognized United Nations-backed government the Government of National Accord (GNA).advanced on the southern and western outskirts of the capital in an assault that left dozens dead and many more woundedTripoli’s airport — which is roughly 15 miles from the center of the city — in the LNA’s first strike butCol. Mohamed Gnounou of the forces loyal to the GNA said on Sunday his troops plan on “purging all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate force” in a counteroffensive called “Volcano of Anger.”This counteroffensive continued as tensions further escalated Sunday when LNA forces unleashed airstrikes on the city’s suburbs. Those were met in turn withThe airstrikes come in spite of calls from the UN asking for a two-hour truce to help evacuate citizens and wounded fighters.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Tripoli on Friday preparing for talks scheduled for next week that were meant to lay the groundwork for democratic elections. Later in the day he tweeted that he was leaving Libya “with a heavy heart” as violence intensified.I leave Libya with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli.The UN is committed to facilitating a political solution and whatever happens the UN is committed to supporting the Libyan people.Haftar a 75-year-old general who once served under Qaddafi returned to Libya in 2011 to aid in the revolution against the dictator.After Qaddafi was deposed Haftar eventually became the leader of militia forces controlling the country’s eastern region. He’s a staunch anti-Islamist general backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Haftar has also received aid from Russia and from France which partnered with the general in hopes he could help slow immigration from African countries. Despite this support there are lingering worries that Haftar could turn out to be little more than a Qaddafi 2.0.The Washington Post’s Fahmi Hussein and Sudarsan Raghavafiled a dispatch from the city of Misurata on Saturday where militia forces who say Haftar reminds them of Qaddafi claimed to have deployed hundreds of truckloads of fighters to help in the fight against Haftar.Many Misurata residents — and the city’s militias — despise Hifter and view him as another dictator in the making. Militias from other pro-government cities such as Zintan also moved into Tripoli according to photos posted on social media.In Misurata a radio station sent out a rallying cry to listeners: “Everyone who owns a gun please go to Tripoli right away to fight for your country against Hifter.”As the fighting continues US troops stationed in Tripoli were ordered to evacuate the city.

Trump attacks Omar after man was charged with threatening to kill her - VoLog In or Sign UTrump attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar hours after a supporter was charged with threatening to kill heHe wants to drive a wedge between Jewish voters and the Democratic Party.Trump attacks Rep. Ilhan Omar hours after a supporter was charged with threatening to kill hePhoto by Ethan Miller/Getty ImagePresident Donald Trump sought to drive a wedge between Jewish voters and the Democratic Party on Saturday by reigniting allegations of anti-Semitism against Rep. Ilhan Omar — just hours after one of his supporters was charged for threatening to kill her.Speaking before the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual convention in Las Vegas on Saturday Trump referenced a weeks-old a first-term Democrat from Minnesota and one of the first Muslim women to serve in Congress.that pro-Israel sentiment in Washington was being bought by pro-Israel lobbyists. Her remarks prompted politicians from both parties to condemn her remarks with some labeling them as anti-Semitic. The Congress member later apologized for her tweets.On Saturday Trump gave Omar a back-handed compliment about the dust-up.“Special thanks to Rep. Omar of Minnesota” the president said. “Oh I almost forgot. She doesn’t like Israel ... I’m so sorry!”On the same day that one of his fans was charged with plotting to murder her President Trump gratuitously attacks Ilhan OmarTrump delivered his disparaging remarks against Omar just hours after police in New York charged a man for threatening to assault and murder her.Patrick Carlineo Jr. an avowed Trump supporter was arrested Friday for calling Omar’s office and delivering an expletive-filled rant that included violent threats against the elected official.“Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her she’s a fucking terrorist? I’ll put a bullet in her fucking skull” Carlineo allegedly told staffers according to thefiled by the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of New York.The 55-year-old suspect reportedly later told investigators that he “loves the president and that he hates radical Muslims in our government.”Trump wants to drive a wedge between Democrats and Jewish voterTrump’s speech on Saturday fits into a larger effort by the president to end the support Democrats have had from many Jewish voters for decades.“Democrats are advancing by far the most extreme anti-Semitic agenda in history” Trump said Saturday adding that if implemented “the Democrats’ radical agenda could very well leave Israel out there all by yourselves.”Trump has also taken to promoting “Jexodus” a supposed wave of Jewish voters leaving the Democratic Party for the GOP. He has for weeks advanced the idea that Democrats are alienating Jewish voters and that the Democratic Party tolerates anti-Semitism.“Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party. We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the Obama Administration and it got worsts &amp; worse. There is anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party. They don’t care about Israel or the Jewish people.” Elizabeth Pipko Jexodus.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)The ‘Jexodus’ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Trump has worked to position himself as a friend of Israel moving theand recently announcing the US will now recognize the contestedGolan Heights as a part of Israe. And the Republican Jewish Coalition has an ambitious plan to invest $10 million into efforts to win Trump new Jewish supporters according toas Vox’s Matt Yglesias explaine Jexodus doesn’t really exist. American Jews have a long-standing allegiance to the Democratic Party stretching back to the turn of the 20th century.And while the party does haveover how to address America’s relationship with Israel — the stance taken by Omar and some other progressives contrasts with “the Democratic establishment’s generically pro-Israel view” as Vox’s— it’s worth noting American Jews are hardly universally united on the issue either. So Omar drawing criticism for her tweets doesn’t mean Jewish Democrats will be fleeing the party en masse.That probably won’t stop Republicans from trying to make significant electoral gains with Israel as a driving issue — as evidenced by Trump’s speech Saturday. So far however these efforts it has yet to bear fruit. And asWhile American Jews are largely (though by no means unanimously) supportive of Israel most do not see political support for Israel to be an adequate substitute for supporting a pluralistic vision of the United States of America which after all is where American Jews live. The contention that Jews should vote Republican because Republicans are stronger backers of the Israeli government isn’t identical to the“dual loyalties” issue that got Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN)in trouble earlier this months but it’s not entirely unrelated either. The reality is that American Jews are Americans not Israelis and while elements of GOP social conservatism appeal strongly to Orthodox Jews for most Jewish AmericansJewish values and Jewish identity are tied up with openness and pluralisin a way that makes the GOP a very hard sell.Trump himself makes efforts to convert Jewish voters to the GOP even more of an uphill climb. The president has been accused of perpetuating anti-Semitic tropes before (like when he referred to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) as being “shifty”) and as Schiff noted on Sunday Trumpdoesn’t have the greatest track recoron forcefully condemning far-right extremism.“If there’s anything that is likely to cement the relationship between the Democratic Party and the Jewish community it’s the presidency of Donald Trump” Schiff told CNN’s Jake Tapper onDemocratic Rep.

Obama town hall Europe: avoid a “circular firing squad” over ideological purity - VoLog In or Sign UBarack Obama warns against a “circular firing squad” over ideological purity in politic“We have to be careful in balancing big dreams and bold ideas with also recognizing that typically change happens in steps” Obama said.Barack Obama warns against a “circular firing squad” over ideological purity in politicFormer President Barack Obama speaks to young leaders from across Europe in a town hall event on Saturday in Berlin Germany.Former President Barack Obama touched on growing divisions within his own party warning against pushes for ideological purity that can result in a “circular firing squad” in a town hall organized by the Obama Foundation in Berlin on Saturday.While taking audience questions about the frustration that comes with lack of change Obama expressed concern about a lack of compromise in Washington and said he specifically worries progressive politicians could be alienating potential allies.“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States — maybe it’s true here as well — is a certain kind of rigidity where we say ‘Oh I’m sorry this is how it’s going to be’” Obama said. “And then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad’ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.”The former president said he believes this approach “weakens” movements and that those that would like to see a progressive agenda “have to recognize that the way we’ve structured democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you.”Obama ended his speech by advocating for patience and incremental change: “We have to be careful in balancing big dreams and bold ideas with also recognizing that typically change happens in steps. And if you want to skip steps you can. Historically what’s ended up happening is sometimes if you skip too many steps you end up having bad outcomes.”What else did Obama talk about?Obama took several audience questions and used them to speak at length about issues facing Europe and the United States.While the former president did not directly address President Trump’s recent meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg or Trump’s criticisms of the organization (the current president has said “NATO is as bad as NAFT” for example) Obama explained why he believes NATO is important.“I can’t say exactly what the United States and NATO are doing right now” Obama said. “I recognize that there are some strains. ... I think it’s important not to separate military alliances — the strength of Europe over the last 20 30 years has not been because there were a bunch of missiles fired. It was because — thankfully — it was because ideas won.”Speaking about immigration in Sweden Obama said “We can’t label everybody who is disturbed by immigration as racist. You know that’s a self-defeating tactic. You push away potential allies people who maybe just haven’t thought about it ... but if they’re exposed to new information and they’re meeting people from other countries and they understand the nature of these different traditions and they see that others are eager to work with you then suddenly they go ‘Ah okay.’”Obama also encouraged people to take a more active role in government arguing citizens with new ideas should reach out to politicians who are open to them.“Sometimes we think of the government as this ‘thing’ that is separate from us” Obama said. “But if we’re active citizens then part of our job is not just to get government to respond to you —  it’s also to improve the government.”He added “The point I’m making is in addition to electing good people one of the things that you can do I think is encourage and work with governments to identify where are bottlenecks where are inefficiencies that could potentially be solved and then finding allies to help improve processes inside of government.”Obama has called for “new blood” in the past — and some of that new blood is at tension with the establishment over ideological puritIn an Obama Foundation event earlier this year Obama called forin the political ranks but new progressive House Democrats have at times found themselves at odds with more established party figures over issues fromrefusing to take corporate PAC moneFor the most part however Democrats have been following Obama’s lead and have been careful to maintain unity in public.notes when Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to a question about the Green New Deal championed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) by saying “It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive. The green dream or whatever they call it nobody knows what it is but they’re for it right?” Ocasio-Cortez didn’t take it as a slight. Instead the first-term Congress member said “I think it is a green dream. I don’t consider to be that a dismissive term.”Similarly policy divides between Democratic 2020 candidates on issues likhave not led to open hostilities — at least not yet.When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) clearly stated “we should get rid of the filibuste” Friday she did not impugn any of her fellow Democrats instead arguing “For generations the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice. And in recent years it’s been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything.”Rep.

Trump tax returns: Lawyer calls Democrats’ demands “a gross abuse of power” - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s lawyer calls Democrats’ demands for tax returns “a gross abuse of power”It’s the beginning of what may become a drawn out legal battle.Trump’s lawyer calls Democrats’ demands for tax returns “a gross abuse of power”Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImageFor more than four years President Donald Trump has refused to release his federal income tax returns. Friday his attorney said the president plans to continue doing so despite pressure from House Democrats to make the returns public.In a letter to the Treasury Department Trump’s attorney William Consovoy called on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reject a request from the House Ways and Means Committee to release the president’s personal and business tax returns.“It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack harass and intimidate their political opponents”. “Once this Pandora’s box is opened the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.”Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) who chairs the House Ways and Means Committeedemanded Trump’s returns on Wednesda following months of astart to a number of investigations into the Trump White House by Democrats newly in control of the House of Representatives.Neal wants six years worth of Trump’personal federal income tax returns and returns for business entities tied to his name spanning 2013 through 2018. The chairman set an April 10 deadline for returns’ release.The president’s legal team made clear this week that it has every intention to fight House Democrats tooth and nail over the issue. The team has already indicated a willingness to bring the issue all the way to the Supreme Court.Trump’s argument for why he shouldn’t release his returns keeps changinTrump defied decades of precedent in refusing to release his returns — every modern presidential party nominee has made their tax returns public at one point or another. The president has justified his refusal to follow suit but his justifications keep changing.Over the course of his 2016 presidential campaign Trump waffled over whether he’d actually make his returns available to the public. Before formally announcing his campaign Trump promisedconservative radio host Hugh Hewithe would release his returns should he run for president. The president then punted on the issue after he formally declared his candidacy months later saying in August 2015 that he’d release them “Trump teased of a big tax return reveal during the Republican primary season. But as Trump’s storyline started to shift around the time he edged closer to clinching the party’s nomination. Trump began arguing that he was barred from releasing his returns because he was being audited by the IRS. Only after the audit was finished would he be able to make the returns public he claimed.Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) debunked these claims as bogus. Nevertheless it’s a justification Trump continues to use today. “Until such time as I am not under audit I will not be doing that thank you” Trump said this week according toHouse Democrats are now trying to use the audit process against the president. They’re using a somewhat novel approach working to obtain Trump’s returns by checking on whether the IRS is properly auditing his taxes.In a letter to the IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Wednesday Neal wrote that although the agency has historically audited the tax returns of sitting presidents and vice presidents little is known about the process. The chairman argued the House needed the returns in order to fulfill Congress’ duty in conducting “oversight of departments and officials.”Trump’s legal team responded by calling on the Justice Department to weigh in; it also asked the Treasury Department to deny Neal’s request until the DOJ submits a formal legal opinion.As New York Times reporter Maggie Habermapoints out central to the attorneys’ argument is a claim that Trump is both a regular citizen and sitting president. On one hand they argue he is a private citizen and that Neal’s committee has “no power to conduct its own examination of the individual taxpayers.” On the other hand Trump has used his authority as president to fill federal agencies with political appointees including Rettig.As Vox’s Emily Stewart reports before he led the IRS Rettig said he wouldn’t advise Trump to release his returns“Would any experienced tax lawyer representing Trump in an IRS audit advise him to publicly release his tax returns during the audit? Absolutely not” Rettig said in 2016.Trump lawyers have consistently elevated the concept of his rights as a private citizen when critics have raised questions about aspects of his conduct in office. Most extreme example of him trying to be two things at once.The almost certain impending legal battle over the president’s tax returns will likely stretch out for months meaning there is a high chance thateven if Democrats do get their hands on the it won’t be until after the 2020 presidential election.Trump has been able to stall on releasing his returns for this long — odds are even with House Democrats turning up the pressure this won’t be his last stand.Rep.

Now the bill is DOA.Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ImageA Texas bill allowing gun owners to carry concealed firearms without a permit is now indefinitely stalled after a pro-gun activist advocated for the legislation by stalking state lawmakers — even appearing at their homes.On Friday Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen announced plans toabandon the “constitutional carry” bilafter the activist Chris McNutt showed up at his doorstep and at the homes of two other lawmakers.McNutt executive director of the nonprofit Texas Gun Rights was reportedly outraged the bill failed to advance quickly through the legislature. He posted a series of rants to his group’s Facebook page complaining about the legislative inaction. He followed these posts with videos of himself visiting the neighborhoods of two Republican state lawmakers Reps. Dustin Burrows of Lubbock and Four Price of Amarillo.McNutt’s social media activity prompted Texas state troopers to put Bonnen’s home under surveillance. That’s how authorities were able to intercept the activist when he attempted to visit the speaker’s home last week while Bonnen was nearly 200 miles away at the state capitol in Austin. Bonnen’s wife and teenage son were reportedly home at the time.Friday Bonnen called McNutt’s actions “gutless intimidation tactics.”“One fringe organization’s leader disturbingly traveled over 700 miles in 24 hours just to visit the homes of lawmakers — knowing full well that members were hundreds of miles away in our Capitol while wives and children were alone” Bonnen said in a statement.McNutt’s actions seem to have rattled several state lawmakers who now say they no longer plan to move forward with the controversial gun bill.House Bill 357 would allow gun owners to carry a pistol either openly or concealed without a permit. In February the chairman of the chair of Texas’ House Homeland Security Committee said he planned to hold a hearing on the bill before the end of the legislative session. In light of recent events however Nevárez says he has reconsidered.McNutt claims Bonnen is guilty of “” against him and other grassroots advocates across Texas.“If politicians like Speaker Dennis Bonnen think they can show up at the doorsteps of Second Amendment supporters and make promises to earn votes in the election season they shouldn’t be surprised when we show up in their neighborhoods to insist they simply keep their promises in the legislative session” he said according to theGrassroots activists are largely driving the constitutional carry movemenThere’s been a wave of so-called constitutional carry or “permit-less carry” laws sweeping across the US in recent years. The laws allow gun owners to carry firearms concealed or not anywhere in public without obtaining a permit or special training beforehand.As many as 20 states have considered measures that roll back restrictions on gun ownership.became the latest state to enact such a law earlier this year and now allows its citizens to carry weapons without a permit. Lawmakers in bothadvanced measures that would remove requirements for permits and training in February.According to The Trace a nonprofit news site that exclusively covers guns and gun violence local grassroots activists in each state are largely driving the movement to expand concealed carry rights.In the view of many pro-gun rights activists any limitation on a gun owner’s right to carry firearms either in public spaces or private is a clear violation of the Second Amendment. Lobbying successes for constitutional carry legislation have empowered pro-gun rights to such an extent that their lobbying efforts have even begun to eclipse those of the National Rifle Association.While the nation’s largest gun lobby champions the latest bills in its press releases local lobbyists who take the NRA’s absolutist rhetoric at face value find themselves chafing at its corporate model of working hand-in-glove with establishment politicians.The resulting friction has fed into the upheaval taking place within gun politics (and American conservatism as a whole) since the rise of the Tea Party which has left the NRA frequently following rather than steering the emboldened extremes of its coalition. Activists in several states told The Trace that the NRA — which did not respond to requests for comment for this story — has not helped their cause. In one state they point to direct evidence that the NRA has undercut their proposals.The efforts of pro-gun activists are starting to bear fruit. Prior to 2010 only two states allowed concealed guns in public spaces without permits or specified training. Now more than a dozen have constitutional carry laws on the books. But as state lawmakers made clear this week Texas likely won’t join their number any time soon.Rep.

Federal Reserve Board Pick Stephen Moore Found In Contempt Of Court Over $300000 In Unpaid Child Support And Alimony - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s Fed pick Stephen Moore was held in contempt of court for failing to pay ex-wife more than $30000It’s just the latest unflattering headline for the controversial nominee.Trump’s Fed pick Stephen Moore was held in contempt of court for failing to pay ex-wife more than $30000One of President Donald Trump’s new picks to serve on the Federal Reserve Boardauthor Stephen Moore was found to be in contempt of court in 2012 for failing to pay more than $300000 in alimony and child support.Court filings recently unearthed byThe Guardian’s Jon Swain and David Smitshow Moore repeatedly failed to make payments that were part of a 2011 divorce settlement with his ex-wife Allison Moore. Not only was Moore found in contempt of court but his failure to comply with the terms of his settlement even prompted a judge to order the sale of his house to satisfy his debts.several police officers accompanied relators and a locksmith to to Moore’s home in May 2013 to change the locks and prepare the property for buyers. Only after the court-sanctioned break-in did Moore pay roughly two-thirds of what he owed his ex-wife court filings show. Allison Moore told the court the $217000 payment was enough and stepped in to halt the house re-sale.Moore is one of two controversial presidential picks to fill open seats on the Federal Reserve Board (Trump’s other nominee is former Republican presidential candidate and pizza company executive). An avowed Trump loyalist Moore is a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who frequently provides economic commentary to media outlets.Allison Moore tried last week to shield the court documents from public view under a court seal but several news outlets appealed to have them released. In a statement released this week Moore said he and his former wife settled their divorce “amicably many years ago and we remain on friendly terms to this day.”Moore’s nomination process isn’t going so smoothlIt’s only been a little over two weeks since Trump first nominated Moore to the Federal Reserve Board and already he’s seen several waves of unflattering headlines.on Moore’s financial woes finding that he stillowes more than $75000 in taxeand penalties to the Internal Revenue Service. The tax lien reportedly stems from a mistake in his 2014 tax filing. Moore said he has been working to resolve the issue with the IRS in part by overpaying his taxes in recent years by“tens of thousands of dollars.”The unflattering news coverage has cast a shadow over Moore’s nomination which some believe was anthat gave little thought to Moore’s qualifications.explained last month “Moore is better-known for his fierce loyalty to Trump than for his brilliant economic intellect.” Rupar has a rundown of the pundits more infamous moments:Moore who was a CNN contributor from 2017 until news broke of his nomination by Trump didn’t just go on TV to talk about economics. He alsodefended now-failed US Senate candidate Roy Moorwhen he was accused of molesting a teenage girl arguing that the Democrat running against him (now-Sen. Doug Jones) was just as bad because he supported abortion rights.Moore also went viral for a cringeworthy interview on Don Lemon’s CNN show in which hetried to slut-shame Stormy Daniel. In addition he is a climate change denier who once said on CNN that scientists lie about climate science to get “It’s still unclear whether Moore’s history controversial views and rocky vetting process will do anything to derail his nomination.whether he felt his divorce settlement would jeopardize his chances of claiming a seat on the Federal Reserve Board Moore had a one-word answer: “No.”Rep.

Trump administration sued by states over unhealthy school lunches  - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s administration let schools serve unhealthy lunches again. States are suing.The states argue that the lax nutrition regulations are a threat to students’ health.Trump’s administration let schools serve unhealthy lunches again. States are suing.A New York public school serves lunch on March 11 2019.Six states and Washington DC led by New York Attorney General Letitia James are fighting President Trump’s mission to make school lunches unhealthy again.During the Obama administration first lady Michelle Obamafor healthier school meals as part of her agenda to tackle obesity. In 2010 Congress passed legislation requiring school lunches to be more nutritious and the Department of Agriculture published new regulations to enforce the law.those guidelines in 2018 allowing schools to abandon their commitment to lowering sodium and increasing whole-grain foods. Nowto set the standards high again.The main argument from the coalition of states which includes New York California Illinois Minnesota New Mexico Vermont and the District of Columbia is that these revised requirements will harm children’s health especially low-income students of color who rely on school lunches for a nutritious meal.The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act passed by Congress in 2010 required schools to only provide grain products that contain at least 50 percent whole grains and reduce sodium full-fat milk and meat from meals. Snacks with low nutritional value were to be swapped out for fruit cups and granola bars.Although the legislation passed with bipartisan support Republicans soon turned against the law citingthat kids were throwing out their healthier but less tasty lunches. Some schools also complained they were struggling to keep up with the stricter standards.New policies under Trump’s administration pushed back against the legislation’s stringent requirements and by 2018 the Department of Agriculturrefined grains in lunches for half of the weekly meals and loosened the requirements on reducing sodium. They also permitted schools to serve flavored 1 percent milk. Only fat-free milk could be flavored under the Obama rules.The lawsuit focuses on three key changes from 2018: the reintroduction of refined grains and two of the changes meant to gradually reduce sodium from school meals.This isn’t the first time states have sued the administration due to disagreement over policies. During the Obama administration a number of conservative states filed lawsuits to oppose Obamacare and DACA. The Trump administration has already had its fair share of court battles most recently the president’sThe states are suing becausthey did not have the opportunity to comment on the requirement changes in 2018. They are also arguing that the new policies are unlawful because they don’t abide by the a national standard for nutritional balance. According to the suit the department failed to provide a proper explanation for these changes which were not made based on scientific evidence or nutritional research.When the changes were implemented the Agriculture Department defended the decisions by saying the Obama-era policies were an economic burden on schools. In order to meet the requirements school districts and states paid an additional $1.22 billion in 2015Agriculture Secretary Scott Perdue added the healthier lunches were “ending up in the trash” because they simply weren’t appetizing to students.Despite these arguments however the complaint makes one statement clear: Children’s nutrition should not be an area of compromise.Rep.

New reports are calling attention to the harms of prison violence - VoLog In or Sign UAmerica is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violencRecent reports show how overcrowding understaffing and limited resources are contributing to violence in prisons.America is finally being exposed to the devastating reality of prison violencPelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City California. This week a Department of Justice report and an Ohio lawsuit called new attention to violent conditions in many US prisons.Mark Boster/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImageIn some US prisons inmates are subjected to violence and inhumane conditions on a daily basis. This week a new report and a lawsuit brought renewed attention to that fact.On Wednesday the Department of Justice released adamning report on prisons in Alabam showing that a combination of understaffing overcrowding and poor management led to the state’s prison system having the highest number of homicides in the country. The conditions are so severe that they effectively deny Alabama inmates their constitutional rights to be protected from “cruel and unusual punishment” the report says.Vox’s German Lopez laid outsome of the report’s detailThe problems the investigators said are tied to a severe lack of staffing and resources. There simply aren’t enough guards in a system where major prisons are on average at 182 percent capacity and staffing levels can fall below 20 percent of authorized positions. And the prison infrastructure itself is often outdated and in deteriorating condition: Doors often can’t lock making it impossible to control violent situations and investigators found open sewage running through prisons.The results are horrifying. As Katie Benner and Shaila Dewanreported for the New York Time “One prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down his face was flattened. Another was tied up and tortured for two days while no one noticed. Bloody inmates screamed for help from cells whose doors did not lock.”Alabama prisons are plagued by “a high level of violence that is too common cruel of an unusual nature and pervasive” the Justice Department concluded. The department noted that it could sue the state in 49 days if it does not address the concerns in the report.While the report has called considerable attention to Alabama it’s far from the only state with systemic problems of this kind.Also on Wednesday two men previously incarcerated at the maximum-security Southern Ohio Correctional Facilityalleging that guards there failed to take action when they were repeatedly stabbed by another inmate in a bloody 2017 incident that was captured on video. The lawsuit which argues that the men’s constitutional rights were violated when the officers failed to protect them from violence in the prisonalso claims that guards failed to provide first aid for 10 minutes after the incident and that the men were beaten by guards on other occasions.Taken together the Alabama report and the Ohio case indicate thaviolence in some US prisons is a systemic issue — a fact that impacts thousands of people incarcerated at these facilities every day.The levels of violence in prisons aren’t fully captured in data but it’s clear that there’s a probleThere’s no single source tracking every incident of violence in America’s prisons but in recent years a number of studies and lawsuits have called attention to the ways that understaffing poor conditions and overcrowding have collided to create unsafe and at times violent environments in a number of these facilities.Sometimes these problems come to light because of individual incidents like thethat took place in South Carolina’s Lee Correctional Institution. In that incident the AP noted that disputes over territory and money led to a bloody conflict that ended with the deaths of seven inmates and the injury of 17 others.That riot called attention to a deeper problem in South Carolina prisons which have been subjected to a number of lawsuits. a South Carolina news outlet prisons are woefully understaffed and have limited — and in some cases nonexistent —mental health resources for inmates.The result is an environment where people turn to gangs for protection and survival fueling violent incidents.“They [officials] obviously aren’t providing the constitutionally required safe environment for the inmates” Carter Elliott a Georgetown lawyer whose has filed lawsuits for inmates in South Carolina told the news outlet last year.In other states inmates have turned tolike work and hunger strikes to call attention to the conditions they are forced to live in.As reports of prison violence in states likeshow dangerous conditions can often lead to severe outcomes for incarcerated people — including homicides assaults rape and drug overdoses — which remain a problem in many prisons and are not limited to any particular region.For example the Ohio lawsuit mentioned above references an when an inmate in a Louisville prison Greg Reinke used a homemade knife to stab four men multiple times. The men were unable to flee because they were shackled to a table. One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit Shamieke Pugh was stabbed a dozen times.The AP notes that the lawsuit against “the warden two officers and other staff members alleges violations of constitutional rights including deliberate indifference to potential harm and different treatment of the attacker who is white compared with the other inmates who are black.“Reinke brutally attacked a prison guard months later and eventually received anin prison on top of the life sentence he was already serving.“I hope no other inmates ever have to fight for their lives the way I had to” Pugh saidduring a Wednesday news conferenc adding that he believes the facility’s guards were responsible for the incident. “I did a crime and I did my time. But the guards got away scot-free after almost killing me. That ain’t right.”The facility has denied that its guards acted inappropriately or failed to respond to the 2017 attack.The issues highlighted in Alabama and Ohio this week of course are part of a broader issue in prisons. But while there are plenty of stories highlighting just how severe the problem is in many states policymakers have not always centered prison reform in broader criminal justice measures. Instead high-profile efforts to address prison conditions have often centered on specific issues like ending the use of solitary confinement or prohibiting the shackling of pregnant women.Some of this has to do with the ways many people think of prisons. Asa recent New York Times article on Alabama’s notorious St. Clair Correctional Facility note national discussion of prisons still often centers around the idea that “whatever treatment prisoners get they surely must deserve.” One of the barriers to adequately addressing prison violence is the belief that violence is normal or expected.But in the face of increased scrutiny and persistent action from prison reform advocates some states like Alabama are finding themselves under intense pressure to change. In February Republican Gov. Kay Iveyintroduced a plan to create new prisonin Alabama with improved health care capabilities education and treatment programs and mental health services. The state says that it was working on reforms before the Justice Department report was released.While the problems highlighted in Alabama are severe it is not the only state with these issues. And as evidence of dangerous environments in US prisons continues to emerge it is likely that more and more local and state governments will be confronted with demands for reform.Rep.

Mark Halperin tried to make a comeback on Michael Smerconish’s radio show  - VoLog In or Sign UMark Halperin says his conduct has changed. His commentary is the same.His first interview post-#MeToo included a pretty sexist assessment of the 2020 field.Mark Halperin says his conduct has changed. His commentary is the same.Mark Halperin wants to come out of the #MeToo cold after 17 months.Mark Halperin swears he’s changed his personal conduct since he wasaccused of sexually harassing or assaultina dozen women and I certainly hope that is true. But his public conduct as a political pundit which is also important has not changed.on Sirius XM radio with host Michael Smerconish a prominent #MeToo critic and said he’s sorry for how he’s hurt women and said he understands now why “it is so painful for a woman or a man in the workplace to be harassed by someone.”in front of a young woman pressing an erection through his clothes ontoand slamming a woman into a wall among other things while he was the political director of ABC news. Halperin denied these specific accusations but apologized at the time to women he said he “He launched into an assessment of the 2020 Democratic field and made a series of sexist assessments and omissions that were the hallmark of his commentary for many years.For example throughout the episode he offered his thoughts on a number of the men in the race but none of the women. His assessments weren’t all positive but by talking about just male candidates he defined the scope of who he thinks is important and who is not. Given this was his first attempt to rehabilitate himself it was a glaring omission.He also downplayed Joe Biden’s kicking things off saying that the coverage is “a bit of a distraction.”“This latest problem I think is getting a lot of attention but it is far from his only problem and in terms of pure politics and winning the nomination far from his biggest problem.”Halperin’s point that Biden has run and lost before is a valid critique but it does not require dismissing the conversation around his conduct as unworthy of attention. It’s the kind of remark that makes victims of abuse not speak out because they believe they won’t be believed or won’t be taken seriously. (Several women who say Biden made them uncomfortable have specifically said they did not speak out sooner for this very reason.)Halperin moved on to gush over Pete Buttigieg praising him in a way thatshows boosts male candidates and harms female candidates. Ambition is perceived as a positive quality in men and negative quality in women. “He’s got the personality and drive” Halperin said offering no explanation of what that means in any case.“[Buttigieg has] what a lot of John McCain supporters felt which is people want to be part of something that’s larger than themselves and I think that the mayor of South Bend makes people feel that way” Halperin said. “He makes people at the grassroots feel that way and he makes elite donors feel that way. A lot of the elite donors care about the country I’d say most of them do and he’s appealing to them.”Halperin’s opinion used to matter. His newsletter was once called the“most influential tip sheet in Washington.” He directed political coverage at ABC. He went on to write two best-selling books on the 2008 and 2012 presidential racesHe was omnipresent on cable news for years.So while he considers himself an outsider watching the passing show his critics have long said he’s also a participant who shapes how we think. And when it came out that he abuses women the media was forced to contend with the work of a man whose behavior shows he does not respect women.As my colleague Ezra Kleinat the time about Halperin and a handful of other powerful men in media: “The most influential institutions in America have long had serial sexual abusers and deep misogynists at their apex. Those abusers didn’t just shape their workplaces or their industries; they shaped our politics our culture and our country.”about how Halperin specifically shaped 2016 describing Hillary Clinton as “a grasping and scandal-plagued woman.” Yet he once argued “the sexual-assault claims leveled at Trump would only help the now-president’s brand.”Politics has changed since Halperin’s hiatus. A historic number of women are running for the Democratic nomination. A historic number of women ran and won in the midterm elections. But it doesn’t seem like Halperin’s own views have changed along with the times.The original version of this story reported that Mark Halperin was accused of masturbating in front of several young women while he was the political director of ABC News. He was accused ofmasturbating in front of one womaaccused him of pressing erections through his clothes against them without their consent. Halperin denies these specific accusations.Rep.

"Trump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one day - VoLog In or Sign UTrump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one daTrump made two remarkably authoritarian remarks in one daTrump leaves the White House on Friday.President Donald Trump made two remarkably authoritarian comments on Friday first urging Congress to “get rid of judges” — specifically immigration judges — and later demeaning the entire media as the “ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!”But in a sign of how normalized the behavior of this president has become neither remark amounted to much more than a blip on the news radar.Trump made his comment about immigration judges during a question-and-answer session with reporters before departing the White House for a photo opportunity along the southern border in California.“Congress has to act” Trump said. “They have to get rid of catch and release chain migration visa lottery they have to get rid of the whole asylum system because it doesn’t work and frankly we should get rid of judges. You can’t have a court case every time somebody steps foot on our ground.”Trump calls on Congress to ""get rid of the whole asylum system"" because ""it doesn't work.""""Frankly we should get rid of judges"" he adds.the second time this week he has urged Congress “to get rid of judges”— a proposal that thankfully for those of us who value checks and balances has little chance of gaining traction now that Democrats control the House.The president however is not even trying to hide the fact he’d like to have the power to summarily deport migrants and asylum seekers and has already demonstrateda willingness to try and seize emergency powerLater while Air Force One was on its way to California Trump posted a tweet in which he characterized the entire “press” as “truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!”The press is doing everything within their power to fight the magnificence of the phrase MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! They can’t stand the fact that this Administration has done more than virtually any other Administration in its first 2yrs. They are truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Trump’s tweet represented an escalation of his anti-press rhetoric. In the past Trump had been careful to qualify his “enemy of the people” attacks as applying to “THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDI” or only pertaining to “White House officials cited Trump’s hedging in his defense. Aftera Trump fan sent package bombto a number of prominent Trump critics in the media and politics last fall Press Secretary Sarah Sanders defended Trump’s “enemy of the people” tweets by “the president’s not referencing all media. He’s talking about the growing amount of fake news in the country. The president’s calling that out.”But last month Trump went a step further and called “” “the Enemy of the People.” Now he’s using that attack against the entire press.The president says a lot of ugly stuff and much of it can safely be tuned out. Still Trump’s comments on Friday highlight how unprecedented the current state of affairs is for our country. The president aspires to being an authoritarian ruler and isn’t really trying to hide it.Regardless of whether you take Trump’s comments literally or merely seriously they are disturbing. Judges are a vital part of the rule of law and the free press is important in any democracy.

New Zealand mosque shooter could be the country’s first life sentence - VoLog In or Sign UThe New Zealand mosque shooter could be the country’s first person sent to prison for lifThe rarity of life sentences may be strange by US standards but it’s typical in much of the developed world.The New Zealand mosque shooter could be the country’s first person sent to prison for lifThe New Zealand flag is flown at half-mast on a Parliament building following the March 15 mass shootings in Christchurch.Marty Melville/AFP via Getty ImageNew Zealand may sentence the gunman who killed 50 people at mosques in the city of Christchurch to life in prison without the possibility of parole. According to the this would be the first time the country has imposed such a sentence. The previous longest prison sentence without parole was 30 years.To an American this might sound shocking. We sentence people to life in prison all the time — and not only for murders or mass killings. InThe Meaning of Life: The Case for Abolishing Life Sentence Marc Mauer and Ashley Nellis point to research suggesting the US accounts for 40 percent of the world’s total life sentences.“A comprehensive 2016 international analysis of life imprisonment found that the number of people serving life imprisonment in the United States is higher than thetotal in the other 113 countries surveyed” Mauer and Nellis write.It’s yet another example of how the USthan any other country in the world — even more than authoritarian nations like China Cuba and Russia.Particularly in European countries — and other nations like New Zealand that have built their justice systems based on European models — the worst prison sentences tend to span two or three decades. Norway even puts a cap on most prison sentences at 21 years with a higher cap only for terrorism and genocide.That’s essentially what New Zealand is doing: It’s making a big exception to its typical tradition of prison sentences in response to terrorism.While this may sound strange to us there’s good evidence that European countries and New Zealand have the right idea. Because as much as America carries out much harsher penalties there’s no evidence that these harsher punishments actually keep us safer. In fact the US has thehighest murder rate among developed nation— even as it imposes much longer prison sentences.There’s a good explanation for that.Why life sentences are unnecessary: People age out of crimThe core point here is what’s known as the age-crime curve. It shows that people tend to age out of crime. In their mid- to late teens and early 20s people are much much likelier to commit a crime than they are in their 30s and especially 40s and on.Here’s the age-crime curve for robbery in 2014 taken from Mauer and Nellis’s book:Marc Mauer and Ashley Nellis/The Meaning of Life: The Case for Abolishing Life SentenceAs the chart makes clear a person’s propensity to commit a crime — in this case a robbery — is at its highest around 20 years old. But it drops quickly after that. In his 30s a person’s chances of committing a robbery drop to 25 percent of what they were at 20. In his 40s the chances drop to less than 12.5 percent. In his 60s the risk nearly vanishes.There are exceptions like lifelong serial killers. But they’re few and far between.Virtually no one in criminology disputes the age-crime curve. Nancy La Vigne vice president of justice policy at the Urban Instituteit’s “pretty well established in the literature.”This shouldn’t come as a surprise to most people particularly those already in their 30s 40s or above. Think about how likely you were as a teen to break the law with underage drinking using illegal drugs shoplifting getting into fights and so on. Now think about how likely you are to do that today assuming you’re older. Regardless of whether you got caught in your teen years you are likely an embodiment of the age-crime curve.John Pfaff a criminal justice expert at Fordham University and the author ofLocked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reforthere are a few reasons for the age-crime curve.“Some of it is physical and hormonal: Testosterone levels go up testosterone levels go down; violence goes up violence goes down. Some of it is purely physical: Even if I was as aggressive now as I was 20 years ago I’m 44 — things are slow things ache a bit more” he explained. “But some of it is also social: Getting married is a pathway out of crime; finding a career is a pathway out of crime. So the longer we keep people in prison the longer we tend to undermine the ways these people mature and age out of crime as they get older.”Other evidence backs this up. In 2017 David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project conducted anextensive review of the researcon longer prison sentences. Hethat “tougher sentences hardly deter crime and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from committing crime outside prison walls it also tends to increase their criminality after release. As a result ‘tough-on-crime’ initiatives can reduce crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run.”In short longer prison sentences can actually make peoplelikely to commit crimes in the long term.At the same time locking people up for long periods of time is very costly. There’s the actual financial cost of putting people in prison which the Prison Policy Initiativeat $182 billion for the US in 2017. There’s also the social cost of people being ripped away from their families and communities; as one example the New York Timesin 2015 that for every 100 black women not in jail or prison in America there are only 83 black men — what amounts to 1.5 million “missing” men who can’t be there for their kids family or community while incarcerated.It’s these kinds of costs along with the evidence that long prison sentences are ineffective that drive other countries to be more cautious in their use of very long prison sentences.So in New Zealand they’re saving the use of life without parole for a person who committed a crime that goes far away from the ordinary. Maybe America could learn from that.For more on this topic readmy case for capping prison sentences at 20 yearRep.

Elizabeth Warren 2020: “We should get rid of the filibuster” - VoLog In or Sign UElizabeth Warren: “We should get rid of the filibuster”Warren makes the case that the filibuster has perpetuated racism and economic inequality.Elizabeth Warren: “We should get rid of the filibuster”Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) attends the National Action Network’s annual convention on April 5 2019 in New York City.Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to be clear: The filibuster — a Senate procedure that has been used to essentially require 60 votes on any piece of legislation — is racist and should be abolished.“For generations the filibuster was used as a tool to block progress on racial justice” Warren said at Rev. Al Sharpton’s civil rights group National Action Network’s convention Friday. “And in recent years it’s been used by the far right as a tool to block progress on everything.”Warren was explicit. If Democrats reclaim power they should get rid of the filibuster she said.“So let me be as clear as I can. When Democrats next have power we should be bold and clear: We’re done with two sets of rules — one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats” Warren said. “And that means when Democrats have the White House again if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country then we should get rid of the filibuster.”The filibuster has become the center of one of the biggest government reform debates of the 2020 presidential election cycle. The filibuster is any attempt to block or delay action on a bill by debating it at length. According to if a senator is recognized they usually have the right to the floor as long as they wish. The only way to end a filibuster in the Senate is to pass cloture which limits debate to 30 hours with the support of 60 members of the Senate.In other words because almost every bill gets filibustered in the Senate every single piece of legislation essentially needs 60 votes to pass — a rule that would inevitably serve as a death blow to bold progressive ideas like Medicare-for-all $15 minimum wage and so on.And as Warren points out the filibuster has also been used to hold back major civil rights progress in the past.“Do you know when the first bill to make lynching a federal crime was introduced? 1918” Warren said at the convention. “One hundred years ago. And it nearly became the law back then. It passed the House in 1922. But it got killed in the Senate — by a filibuster. And then it got killed again and again and again. More than 200 times. An entire century of obstruction because a small group of racists stopped the entire nation from doing what was right.”Most 2020 candidates are reluctant to end the filibusteWarren has expressed an openness to ending the filibuster in the past. She toldthat “all the options are on the table.” Now she is cementing her position on the Senate rule.And while she’s not completely alone in this stance — candidates South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee have also supported it — she’s in the minority among her Senate colleagues running for president.“We should not be doing anything to mess with the strength of the filibuster”has said. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said she isSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has raised the concerns most filibuster defenders have: She’s nervous what would happen if Democrats end up in the minority. who has always campaigned on the boldest progressive ideas that don’t even have the buy-in of most sitting Democratic senators says he’s “not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster” instead calling for statehood for the District of Columbia. It’s a position thatsome have argued is tantamounto Sanders admitting he’s not serious about actually making any of his policies law.There’s no question that the filibuster makes it much harder for the Senate to pass major legislation and would render almost all the ideas that progressive 2020 candidates are currently running on extremely difficult to pass into law. There is one workaround through an obscure process called which allows the Senate to pass one piece of legislation a year with a simple majority. It’s how Republicans attempted to repeal and replace Obamacare and passed their tax bill. But budget reconciliation has a bunch of restrictions that wouldprevent Democrats from passing minimum wage increases or robust health care change the filibuster also has given lawmakers some political cover on difficult votes:A senator can even take a position in favor of some sweeping piece of legislation and then quietly reassure interest group opponents that everyone knows this isn’t getting 60 votes and really just represents an opening bid. Senators in purple states meanwhile often enjoy the ability totaking clear positions on issues. Since many areas of policy can in practice only be legislated on via bipartisan deals it’s usually possible for a member to remain ambiguous whenever that seems most suitable.Warren however isn’t going to wait for progressives to suddenly take supermajorities in the Senate. And her case for getting rid of the filibuster is twofold: It not only allows for an unjust class system to worsen in this country but also perpetuates racial divides.“We can’t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind” Warren said. “We can’t sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington and while too much of a child’s fate in life still rests on the color of their skin.”Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaigElizabeth Warren: “We should get rid of the filibuster”Elizabeth Warren wants CEOs to go to jail when their companies behave badlRep.

The resolution which is nonbinding simply urges the public release of the report and notes that it is not calling for the release of any content that is “expressly prohibited by law.”As Vox’s Ella Nilsen has reporte this resolution overwhelmingly passed the House on a bipartisan basis 420-0. (It’s worth noting that the House vote took placebefore Barr’s summary of the reporwas actually released.) In the Senate however multiple Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Judiciary Chair Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Paul have moved to bar it from consideration whilehas called for the report to be released.Thus far the only reasons Republicans have given for their position on the resolution haven’t been particularly convincing. While McConnell has said that he’s rejected the measure because he wants to give Barr time to coordinate with the special counsel’s office about how to release additional contents of the report Democrats have argued that the resolution not only does nothing to prevent him from doing that it also doesn’t set any deadline for him to follow through.Meanwhile both Graham and Paul have not been shy about noting that their objections are heavily “political.” Graham had said he was pushing back against the resolution because he wanted more information about the 2016 investigation intoHillary Clinton’s private email serve. “I’m just making a political point”he told the Charleston Post and Couriewhen he shot down the resolution in mid-March. Paul meanwhile called for a review of how the Russia investigation began and why law enforcement officials were looking into the Trump campaign in the first place.It’s a response that completely deflects from the main — and straightforward issue — that the resolution is trying to address. And the diversion hasn’t gone unnoticed.“I have yet to hear a legitimate policy concern raised by my Republican colleagues who are blocking this bipartisan resolution or trying to bog it down with bizarre partisan amendments” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) the latest Democrat to urge a vote on the resolution on Thursday told Vox in a statement.There is a slightly more concrete reason some Republicans have highlighted about their reluctance to publish the report: They’re worried that information within it content that may not fall under the auspices of legal protection could be released and ultimately detrimental to certain people’s reputations and DOJ norms.But a big reason Republicans may have not been able to offer any real explanation for why they’re opposing this resolution? They’re doing so to protect President Donald Trump — and they can’t explicitly say that.Republicans could be worried about other redactionIf the report is ever released in a more comprehensive form there are expected to be quite a few redactions. Some of these redactions could be for legal reasons while others might be made in accordance with DOJ norms asThe Justice Department typically doesn’t release damaging information about people if they’re not charged with any specific crimes or explain wha matter doesn’t rise to criminal prosecution.Redactions made to adhere to these norms might not all be legally warranted — and thus not protected under this particular resolution Adam White a law professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School told Vox.“To the extent the resolution would only redact information that can legally [not] be released that’s not broad enough” he said. “My own view of this is that any release should be consistent with Justice Department norms.”That’s a concern that several Republican lawmakers have also alluded to while protesting the resolution.“It’s the [attorney general’s] responsibility to go through and protect the reputation of innocent people from being disparaged who weren’t charged with any crime” Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) told reporters last week. “The resolution doesn’t make any exceptions for that type of information I described it’s certainly overly broad.”Democrats argue that this opposition is just a way for Republicans to show they are in lockstep with TrumTrump has previously said that he too would be open to releasing the Mueller report publicly but his willingness to actually follow through on this push seems to have falteredas more time has passed sincthe release of Barr’s top-line summary. The administration appears particularly keen on getting a grasp of the specifics in the report before wholeheartedly endorsing true transparency Warner said.“So far the president and his allies have paid lip-service to transparency — heck even the president said it should be released to the public” he noted. “Unfortunately their actions indicate this president has no intention of signing this resolution until he knows what the report actually says about his conduct.”Senate Republicans meanwhile are underscoring their support for the president by continuing to thwart Democratic efforts to vote on this resolution.“There have been some small cracks in the relationship between Trump and House and Senate Republicans but by continuing to block a simple resolution calling for the release of the Mueller report Republicans on the Hill are making it very clear that they are still prepared to [do] everything they can to protect the president” says Jim Manley a staffer to former Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.There’s certainly a “political calculus” involved in the way lawmakers have responded on both sides of the aisle White added. For now it seems that “calculus” is preventing many Senate Republicans — though not all — from fully supporting any kind of public release of the report.Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation: news and latest updateWhat we know about Mueller’s case against Trump on obstruction of justicSenate Republicans keep blocking a resolution to make the Mueller report publiSome Mueller team members aren’t happy with Barr’s description of their findingRep.

Immigration: Trump suddenly withdraws ICE head’s nomination baffling officials - VoLog In or Sign UTrump just withdrew his nominee to lead ICE — and didn’t really explain whHomeland Security officials were reportedly “baffled” by the move.Trump just withdrew his nominee to lead ICE — and didn’t really explain whDonald Trump’s “who knows?” shrug in this picture is a decent approximation of the expression of this article’s author upon learning that Donald Trump was suddenly withdrawing the nomination of Ron Vitiello to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement late Thursday night while keeping Vitiello on as acting director of the agency.Ida Mae Astute/ABC via GettPresident Donald Trump suddenly withdrew the nomination of his acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ron Vitiello to formally lead the agency late Thursday night — in a move that appears to have shocked the Department of Homeland Security the Cabinet department in which ICE is located.Trump told reporters Friday morning that he’d withdrawn Vitiello’s nomination because “we’re going in a tougher direction.” It is not at all clear what he means.The move was so unexpected that one DHS official initially told thethat the notification sent to Congress Thursday night signed by Trump and informing them that he was withdrawing Vitiello’s nomination must have been a “paperwork error.”Other officials seemed unpleasantly surprised by the development. Nick Miroff of the Washington Post tweeted Friday morning that DHS sources wereVitiello was also dropped from Trump’s Friday trip to Calexico California where he’s expected to tour the section of border barriers that his administration has anointed the first section of the Trump wall. But Vitiello is staying on as acting ICE director presumably until a replacement is nominated and confirmed by the US Senate.Trump hasn’t yet had an ICE director confirmed by the Senate during his two-plus years in office. His first acting director Tom Homan was nominated but never got a floor vote. Vitiello became acting director of the agency in June 2018 and was formally nominated in August.The Senate Homeland Security Committee had approved Vitiello’s nomination in November — despiteopposition from some chapters of the ICE unio which pointed to tweets from Vitiello criticizing Trump before the 2016 presidential election. The Senate Judiciary Committee (which also needed to approve the nomination before the full Senate could vote) was set to vote on Thursday but committee chair and Trump confidant Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) delayed the vote before the hearing for unspecified reasons.There’s no particularly obvious “tougher direction” for ICE to go right noTrump’s characterization of the withdrawal as a policy move — going in a “tougher direction” — makes it especially weird that the other people currently implementing immigration policy knew nothing about it in advance. It reflects either Trump’s ongoing ignorance of what his administration is actually doing on immigration or his desire born out of frustration to take the reins away from DHS and start calling the shots himself.Either way it’s not obvious what a “tougher direction” for ICE would be.Trump is in the midst of another temper tantrum about current US immigration policy. But his attention has generally been fixed on the genuinely unprecedented influx of Central American families at the US-Mexico border. And ICE is in charge of immigration enforcement in the interior of the US not at the border.Trump’s recent complaints about immigration to the extent that they bear any relationship to reality have been about the failure of Mexico and Central American countries to stop northward migration to the US; about the asylum laws that require that anyone who can show a “credible fear” of persecution to be allowed to stay in the US and apply for asylum; and about an unspecified but now repeated lament that “we have to.” (No one else in the administration has said this; other figures in the Trump administration have made it clear that the need is for more judges to hear cases more quickly and for fewer asylum seekers to go in front of judges at all.)None of that has anything to do with ICE. ICE’s primary responsibilities are arresting immigrants within the US detaining immigrants pending deportation hearings prosecuting immigrants in those hearings and deporting those who are ordered deported.ICE has been more aggressive on all these fronts under the Trump administration than it was in the last years of the Obama administration and is setting new records for the number of immigrants in detention (blowing through its budget to do so). Just this week it launched thebiggest workplace raid in a decad arresting more than 280 immigrants at a Texas cellphone repair facility. But it’s still not arresting or deporting as many immigrants as it did in Obama’s first term.This is partly due to the decreased willingness of blue cities and states to defer to ICE in picking up immigrants from jail after they’d otherwise be released and partly — especially in the past year — because resources are being taken up dealing with the influx of families and asylum seekers at the border.The Trump administration has put a lot of emphasis on rolling out aggressive policies that make more people vulnerablto deportation. But that doesn’t automatically get people deported. ICE actually has to arrest them and open (or reopen) cases against them to do that.ICE’s detention responsibilities extend to detaining anyone caught at the border within 72 hours of their apprehension. But they’re constrained much to the Trump administration’s frustration by a court ruling that limits the time families can be detained before they must be released into the US pending the resolution of their court cases.There have been questions about coordination between ICE and Customs and Border Protection (the agency overseeing border enforcement) when it comes to the transfer of migrant families. But Trump’s comments about being “tougher” don’t necessarily reflect that.It’s also doubtful that whoever Trump might nominate in lieu of Vitiello would be confirmed by the Senate. Democrats are increasingly unwilling to endorse any aspect of federal immigration enforcement as run by Trump and some Republicans remain leery of Trump immigration-hawk favorites like former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.When Vitiello was nominated he was seen as the only confirmable candidate for the position; he was a career law enforcement officer who’d come from a leadership position at CBP. That apparently is no longer tough enough for Trump. Who could pass that bar whether the Senate will fall in line and what a “tougher direction” might look like in practice remain to be seen.Rep.

2020 Democrats’ debate over filibuster reform explained - VoLog In or Sign UThe Democratic debate over filibuster reform explaineNobody runs on Senate procedure but without changing it nothing is going to happen.The Democratic debate over filibuster reform explaineSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) speaks on health care as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) listens during an event September 13 2017 on Capitol Hill.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) thinks Democrats should end the filibuster if they regain the majority in the US Senate and pass legislation by majority rule.“When Democrats next have power we should be bold and clear: We’re done with two sets of rules — one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats”Warren says in advance text of a Friday speech to the National Action Network obtained by CN. “And that means when Democrats have the White House again if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and puts small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems facing this country then we should get rid of the filibuster.”Warren is of course running for president and doubtless envisions herself as leading this charge from the White House. The Senate however makes its own rules and a majority of senators could vote to change the rules and allow majority votes to prevail. If Democrats fare well in 2020 a rule change would greatly increase the likelihood that some of these big progressive ideas could come to fruition. But top Democrats are skeptical.“We should not be doing anything to mess with the strength of the filibuster”says Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)Most presidential candidates in the Senate are with Booker.he’s “not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster.” His plan for Senate reform is statehood for the District of Columbia which he thinks can be done because“I hope my Republican colleagues do the right thing.”Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) isAnd Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is concerned about the risks to being in the minority. “Having just lived through being in the minority” “I just want to think long and hard about it.”Candidates not in the Senate by contrast are more inclined to agree with Warren.South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is all for scrapping iThis debate is important because there’s no way almost anything the candidates are promising to do will happen unless the filibuster is lifted.It’s up to the Senate to change its rules not the president —Barack Obama’s calls for filibuster refordidn’t work and neither have— and most of the candidates running are going to be back in the Senate after 2020. They show little appetite for reform.Progressive politics right now is very focused on broad ideological visions. It hasn’t grappled with the reality that progressives are at a massive disadvantage in the upper chamber of Congress and no bold idea will make it through without a change.A brief history of the filibusteFans of the filibuster often describe it as a noble and longstanding Senate tradition evoking the image of Jimmy Stewart speaking for 25 hours straight to fight corruption in the movies. But the practice actually has a mostly sordid history. And its current usage serves as a de facto requirement that all bills clear a supermajority threshold.In its earliest days the US Senate lacked any procedural mechanism for forcing the end of debate on an issue. This was understood as a matter of collegiality in what was at the time a very small legislative body and not as a requirement that legislation be unanimous. There were a handful of filibusters over the course of the 19th century (North Carolina Sen. William King organized an important 1841 filibuster of legislation to reauthorize the charter of the Second Bank of the United States) but in general legislation passed by majority rule.Things changed in 1917. Near the height of World War I Germany announced a policy that its submarines would enforce a blockade of Britain-bound shipping by sinking any merchant vessels heading for the British Isles. In response Woodrow Wilson and most members of Congress supported legislation that would arm American merchant ships. Sen. George Norris of Nebraska along with 11 colleagues filibustered the bill and in response Wilson urged the Senate to adopt a rule allowing for a supermajority of 67 senators to kill a filibuster.This allowed Wilson’s wartime legislation to pass but somewhat ironically limiting filibusters served to somewhat normalize them and it became routine for a Southern-based minority of senators to filibuster civil rights legislation.Over the civil rights battles of the 1950s and ’60s filibustering rules were tweaked several times until the modern filibuster rule emerged in the 1970s. The key features of the modern system are that it requires 60 affirmative votes to end debate on a topic but also that the Senate can simply move on to other issues without having formally invoked cloture on earlier issues. This turned filibustering into a less spectacular event than it had previously been — to filibuster a bill no longer meant holding up all bills — which in practice has served over time to encourage senators to do it more and more frequently.As recently as the George W. Bush administration however it was still the case that notwas filibustered. Both his 2003 Medicare reform bill and the nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court passed with more than 50 but fewer than 60 votes though Democrats did also take the previously unprecedented step of filibustering federal appeals court nominees.During the political standoff over these appeals court filibustersthat Democrats should take advantage of Republican frustration to strike a high-minded compromise and return the Senate to the principle of majority rule.But Democrats did not take that advice only to find a few years later when Barack Obama was in office that Republicans were now holding everything to a 60-vote threshold. Constant filibustering shrank the size of the stimulus (consigning millions of people to years of additional unemployment) compromised the design of the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and doomed any effort to legislate on climate change or immigration reform.Later Republican filibustering of Obama’s nominees got so out of control that Senate Democrats felt compelled to change the rules and make filibustering of nominees impossible.Under Trump Republicans have taken advantage of that new rule set to get judges confirmed at a rapid pace. But Democratic filibusters have impeded Republican legislating ensuring that even before Democrats took House in the 2018 midterms the GOP could not pass legislation to build a wall or cut legal immigration.The filibuster is probably bad for the lefWhich party the filibuster advantages or disadvantages depends on the current state of politics — in 2005-2006 filibustering frustrated Republicans; in 2009-2010 it frustrated Democrats; in 2017-2018 Donald Trump issued the clearest call for filibuster abolition that we’ve seen from any president.A separate question is whether a shift to majority rule would advantage one side over the other systematically over the long haul.There is of course no real way to prove this. But historically anti-filibuster sentiment has mostly come from the left.  Even though policy obviously swings back and forth over time there does tend to be a ratchet effect. The fight for women’s suffrage was long and difficult but once women had the vote taking it away was essentially impossible. A broadly similar dynamic tends to play out with social welfare programs as well.UC Berkeley political scientist Paul Pierson explained in his 1994 bookand his follow-up 1996 paper“The New Politics of the Welfare State”) that even very successful conservative politicians like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher generally fail to take away major social benefits once they’ve been created. Pierson argues that social programs create a new politics and in particular build a constituency of people benefiting from the programs that is politically powerful and can resist efforts to dismantle them.This is obviously not an ironclad law of nature. But the fact that Bush failed to privatize Social Security and Trump failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act tends to further support Pierson’s original analysis of Thatcher and Reagan. Note in particular that Bush’s Social Security plans never managed to pass the House while Trump ACA repeal bills were eligible for a procedural maneuver that would have needed only a simple majority; in neither case did the filibuster save the welfare state’s bacon.It’s very hard to create big new programs but once they’re in place they are hard to take away. There is for example vociferous disagreement about the political viability of a Big Bang switch away from the current US health insurance patchwork to a uniform single-payer system. But nobody thinks that if a single-payer system existed it would be remotely viable to try to switch back to the current pastiche. Similarly if you passed a law making it easier to form labor unions that would lead to more unionized workers which would make it harder to pass new anti-union laws.Of course even if you accept this logic it’s still the case that some important specifiprogressive causes — the legality of late-term abortions or the continued existence of the diversity visa lottery — could be imperiled by ending filibusters.More fundamentally however the filibuster’s existence is convenient for actual senators.Supermajority rule makes life easier for senatorYale political scientist David Mayhew makes the point that members of Congress are generally rewarded for “position-taking” rather than for achieving results.And while the filibuster makes it harder to achieve results precisely for that reason it makes position-taking easier. A Democratic senator facing pressure from activists to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour might worry that his read of the economics literature is much more supportive of something like a $12 wage floor. But coming out for $12 would disappoint activists without meaningfully appeasing employer groups who oppose any increase whatsoever. The good news for our conflicted senator is that since it would take 60 votes for a bill to pass there’s very little need to worry that even unanimous Democratic support for $15 an hour is going to produce a $15-an-hour minimum wage anytime soon.If you decide that you want to side with the activists in other words you can just side with the activists and not worry too much about the details. A senator can even take a position in favor of some sweeping piece of legislation and then quietly reassure interest group opponents that everyone knows this isn’t getting 60 votes and really just represents an opening bid.Senators in purple states meanwhile often enjoy the ability to avoid taking clear positions on issues. Since many areas of policy can in practice only be legislated on via bipartisan deals it’s usually possible for a member to remain ambiguous whenever that seems most suitable.Reform happens on the rare occasions when the imperative to actually make policy outweighs senators’ preference for position-taking. Wartime exigency in 1917 was such an example. The GOP using filibusters of nominations to render whole federal agencies inoperable was another. Democrats saying they wouldn’t confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court simply because they didn’t like his jurisprudence was yet another.Had Senate Republicans blocked any fiscal stimulus move in 2009 that might have prompted filibuster reform. But instead Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe agreed to back a somewhat scaled-down package. Later GOP filibusters of immigration and climate legislation were frustrating to progressives.But fundamentally the fact that bills on this topic would have to be bipartisan to pass was exactly what most Democratic members found appealing about the filibuster rule.Democrats have big ideas but no planRightly or wrongly Democrats headed into the Obama years with the expectation that they’d be able to do to a lot of substantive legislation on a bipartisan basis.The Affordable Care Act drew inspiration from several ideas that had attracted Republican support in the past and during the Bush years both carbon emissions reduction bills and comprehensive immigration reform bills had received support from a non-trivial minority of GOP legislators. Similarly for years his administration aspired to achieve some kind of bipartisan “grand bargain” on the long-term budget deficit that would pair tax increases on the wealthy with cuts to Social Security and Medicare spending.This was all proven mostly false by the end of Obama’s first term. Still Obama harbored hope that securing reelection wouldand unlock the doors to bipartisan cooperation. For a brief moment in 2013 it even seemed like that might be true until conservative opposition torpedoed a once-promising bipartisan immigration reform bill.Today’s Democrats no longer frame proposals around bipartisan legislative strategies that nobody believes will work. But Warren’s words aside there’s also no indication that Democratic senators — including many of the authors of the main ambitious proposals that have dominated the policy debate — are taking any steps to move the Senate to a majority rules basis. Nor do they seem content to limit aspirations to the kind of changes that could qualify for the. There is however no realistic chance that Democrats are going to pick up 13 Senate seats in 2020.Indeed even taking a majority would be a stretch.Every Senate map is bad for DemocratA perennial cliché of 2018 midterms coverage was that Democrats faced a bad “map” in the Senate with many of their incumbents up for reelection often in tough states.And indeed the map was so bad that even in the context of the party winning a huge landslide in the House popular vote they actually lost Senate seats. The 2020 map will be relative to 2018 considerably kinder.There is one highly vulnerable Democratic incumbent (Doug Jones in Alabama) and one highly vulnerable Republican (Cory Gardner in Colorado) plus a handful of plausible Democratic pickups in Arizona Georgia Iowa North Carolina  Maine and maybe Texas with really nothing plausibly on the board for the GOP.A more pessimistic way of looking at it however would be this. In 2016 Hillary Clinton won the national popular vote by a healthy 2 percentage points. Nevertheless she only carried 20 states out of 50. Three of those states — Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin — were very close so a slight improvement on her 2-point win would get Democrats to 23. Then there’s Florida which she lost by 1.2 points and North Carolina which she lost by 3.7 points.Assuming a uniform swing in other words a Democratic presidential candidate would need to win the national popular vote by almost 6 percentage points in order to carry half the states. That’s not impossible to pull off — Obama did it in 2008 Bill Clinton did in 1996 and George H.W. Bush did in 1988 — but it’s certainly rare. And this means Democrats are going to perennially struggle to obtain a Senate majority. It’s not out of the question that Democrats will hold 50 seats after 2020 but to get them they’ll need to win multiple races in states that Clinton lost by 4 to 5 pointsknock off a popular moderate incumbent in Maine — winning a majority of votes nationwide won’t be good enough.The problem to a first approximation is that America’s largest states — California Texas New York and Florida — all have significantly more non-Hispanic whites than the national average. That ends up meaning that most states are whiter than the national average meaning white voters — and as it turns out specifically rural and less-educated white voters — are significantly overrepresented in the Senate map.Filibuster reform could be a plaThis Senate disadvantage arguably strengthens the progressive case for keeping the filibuster since if you expect the GOP to hold the majority most of the time then majority rule voting could only empower Republicans. But there are two offsetting considerations.One is that the underrepresentation of voters of color in the Senate could be partially rectified by turning DC and Puerto Rico into states but to do that you’d need to overcome GOP filibusters. The other is that arguably filibustering itself — by making it hard to pass legislation — encourages politics to focus on the hazy culture war topics that allow Republicans to run up the score with rural white voters.Democrats’ pitch to working-class white voters is that they have plans to help them in concrete material ways. But to deliver that help — whether it’s on health care rural broadband infrastructure or anything else — Democrats need to be able to legislate.If the reality of politics is that actual policy change is going to be extraordinarily rare and normally take the form of bipartisan deals negotiated behind closed doors by contrast then it arguably does make sense for voters to ignore their specific material interests and vote on the basis of hot-button symbolism instead.In a majority-rule Senate it would make sense to ask voters to elect senators — and a president — who will deliver Social Security expansion or revise antitrust law. But if the reality is that none of this stuff is actually on the table then why not vote to signal your disapproval of Colin Kaepernick or the excesses of campus political correctness?But so far there is no indication that Senate Democrats as a group are taking the possibility of filibuster reform even remotely seriously. Even members who were vocal and active on the issue in the mid-Obama years have largely gone dormant.That doesn’t change the fact that there are very real stakes in the 2020 presidential campaign. But it does mean those stakesrelate more to foreign policy and executive branch appointmentthan they do to the big-picture legislative topics that have dominated the discussion thus far.Rep.

March jobs report: economy added 190000 new jobs - VoLog In or Sign UThe latest jobs report shows why it’s still a workers’ labor markeEven as the economy slows companies are still hiring rapidly.The latest jobs report shows why it’s still a workers’ labor markeA Help Wanted sign in a shop window in San Francisco on September 12 2018.Employers added a solid 196000 new jobs to the US economy in March — slightly more than economists expected according to thelatest jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistic. But wage growth slowed back to a crawl.Despite the tightening labor market workers only got a 4-cent average hourly pay raise in March. A month earlier wages jumped about 10 cents the fastest they had risen since 2017.And all the hiring in March didn’t do much to change the already super-low unemployment rate which is still 3.8 percent.The new data shows that the US economy remains strong even though it’s not really booming. For example average monthly job growth in the first quarter of 2019 was about 180000 which is lower than the 223000 monthly average during the same period in 2018. The decrease isn’t alarming; it just suggests that the economy isn’t growing as fast as before and that theis making it hard for employers to fill all the open positions.The strong labor market is a good sign for workers. Such a low unemployment rate means that nearly every American who wants to work and is able to has snagged a job by now. And those who lose their jobs or decide to leave probably won’t have a hard time finding another position.However the latest jobs report once again shows little wage growth which remains the biggest weakness in the American economy. The average US worker hasn’t seen their paycheck get much bigger since the Great Recession whichIn March private sector workers (excluding farmworkers) got an average 4-cent hourly raise adding up to an average hourly pay of $27.70. In the past 12 months average hourly earnings have only increased by 3.2 percent and that doesn’t even take inflation into account.The jobs report does point to a strong and steady economy though with the most new jobs created for hospital and ambulance workers nurses and software developers.So even though Americans are finding jobs pretty easily they still aren’t seeing the so-called “economic boom” reflected in their paychecks.Wages hardly grew in MarcSlow income growth has been the most persistent problem afflicting the US economy in its recovery from the Great Recession.with the cost of living even as the unemployment rate dropped andMarch’s 4-cent average hourly wage hike suggests more of the same despite a surprising 10-cenjump in February (At first the labor department recorded an 11-cent increase but revised it down by a penny).Over the past year the cost of food and housing have gone up so paychecks have had to stretch further. But because of recent falling gas prices the annual inflation ratehas fallen to 1.5 percenhigh of 2.4 percent in 201).

Trump’s absurd threat to close the border “if the drugs don’t stop” - VoLog In or Sign UTrump is blaming Mexico for the US’s drug problem. He should blame a failed war on drugs.Trump threatened to close the border “if the drugs don’t stop.” But the problem isn’t Mexico.Trump is blaming Mexico for the US’s drug problem. He should blame a failed war on drugs.President Donald Trump on Thursdaythat he will impose tariffs on Mexico or close the US-Mexico border “if the drugs don’t stop or largely stop.”The threat is supposed to push Mexico into action in the international war on drugs but more than anything it shows Trump doesn’t understand why Mexico hasn’t stopped drugs from flowing into the US. It’s not Mexico’s apathy; it’s that the war on drugs which Mexico is very much invested in isn’t working.Mexico has been trying very hard for years to stop the flow of drugs into America. The US hasdedicated hundreds of millions of dollarand both military and law enforcement resources to Mexico for the cause while Mexico has built up its own police and military to fight drug cartels and other trafficking organizations. Mexico has sacrificed a lot here; according to the there have been 150000 intentional homicides linked to the drug war in Mexico since the government there escalated its war on drugs in 2006.But this clearly isn’t working. Today drugs continue to flow freely into America — with illicit a synthetic opioid and heroin linked to tens of thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US each year as the nation deals with anTrump’s comments put the failure on Mexico suggesting that the tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars it’s spent in this effort aren’t enough. The reality is that a lot of the blame — if not most of the blame — falls on the US and a failure of American drug policy.Why the war on drugs isn’t stopping drugs from MexicThe reason drugs are coming to the US is not because Mexico just one day randomly decided to send them here. It’s because there’s a huge demand for the drugs in the US. That demand creates a major drug market for criminal organizations which drug cartels readily tap into. In other words it’s American demand that’s primarily driving the flow of drugs.More supply can lead to more drug use since easier access to drugs lets more people try illicit substances and get addicted to them. But there are a few reasons why the drug war which is largely focused on cracking down on supply hasn’t worked.First is a concept known as the “profit paradox.” One of the primary goals of the drug war is to make drugs more expensive by limiting their supply; the idea is that a drug habit is much more difficult to sustain if drugs are more expensive.But this also makes drugs immensely profitable. According to Jon Caulkins a drug policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University the war on drugsthe price of drugs from production to sale in the US by as much as 10 times. This creates a paradox in which drugs are less affordable and accessible but the drugs that are sold are enormously profitable for criminal organizations despite all the trouble of smuggling the substances through Latin America and into the US. So drug cartels keep shipping drugs to the US despite the risks of military and law enforcement action.: When one source of drugs shuts down another takes its place. The name comes from the a beast that in some versions of the story grew another head when its previous one was cut off.Since drugs are so lucrative drug producers and traffickers don’t just cease to exist when governments detain or kill them. The business is so profitable that someone will always be there willing to replace defunct organizations or leaders. So when Mexican and US officials someone simply replaced him as head of the Sinaloa cartel. And even if his powerful Sinaloa cartel collapsed another drug trafficking organization would just take its place. There’s simply too much demand for illicit drugs for a criminal organization to not take advantage of it.The effect is similar to the “balloon effect” when cracking down on the drug trade in one area simply moves it to another area — sort of like pushing down on a balloon can simply move the air to other parts of the balloon. This effect has been documented all around the world includingThese concepts help explain why more aggressive anti-drug efforts haven’t worked. A 2014by Peter Reuter at the University of Maryland and Harold Pollack at the University of Chicago found that while simply prohibiting drugs to some extent does raise their prices there’s no good evidence that tougher punishments or harsher supply elimination efforts do a better job of driving down access to drugs and substance misuse than less aggressive efforts. So escalating the drug war — what Trump is calling for here — just can’t do much to stop the flow of drugs.The real answer is more addiction treatmenThese concepts are one reason border security experts say Trump’s wallwon’t stop the flow of drugs into the U— on top of the fact that most drugs are shipped through legal ports of entry not the illegal border crossings that a wall would attempt to prevent.These failures are also a big reason drug policy expertsas the main solution to the opioid epidemic. The thinking: If the US can’t stop the supply it can at least reduce the demand by getting fewer people to use drugs.In other countries this has worked. When France opened up access to buprenorphine a highly successful opioid addiction treatment medication overdose deaths declined by 79 percent over the next five years as the number of people in treatment went up aThe American Journal on AddictionBut despite experts’ calls Trump has not even proposed the tens of billions of dollars to treatment that expertsis necessary to combat the opioid epidemic. Meanwhile the US continues pouring tens of billions into its supply-focused drug war.And now Trump is upset that it’s not working.The opioid epidemic: America's deadliest drug overdose crisiTrump is blaming Mexico for the US’s drug problem.

House Democrats sue the Trump administration over the border wall - VoLog In or Sign UHouse Democrats are suing the Trump administration over the border walHouse Republicans may have established the precedent they need to successfully do so.House Democrats are suing the Trump administration over the border walPresident Donald Trump’s shadow is seen behind House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the Friends of Ireland Luncheon in honor of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the US Capitol on March 14 2019 in Washington DC.House Democrats plan to sue the Trump administration over the president’s attempts to reauthorize funds for a House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday.In February President Donald Trumpin an effort to obtain roughly $8 billion in funding for the border wall a last-ditch effort he made after Congress declined to fulfill an earlier spending request. House Democrats haven’t filed their suit yet but they intend to take to the courts and argue that this move was unconstitutional Pelosi said.Trump has after all ignored the will of Congress — the body that’s authorized to approve federal spending by the Constitution — not once but twice. After Congress rejected Trump’s initial demands for border wall money it alsopassed a resolution aimed at blocking his national emergenc— a clear sign that the majority of the body disagreed with his efforts. (Trump issued thefirst veto of his ter“The President’s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority” Pelosi said in a statement on Thursday. “Congress as Article I — the first branch co-equal to the other branches — must reassert its exclusive responsibilities reserved by the text of the Constitution and protect our system of checks and balances.”One of the key questions House Democrats will face with this lawsuit is whether they have the legal standing to sue in the first place. Plaintiffs must prove that there is harm being caused in order to secure standing.Interestingly enough House Republicans may have actually set a precedent that could make Democrats’ case for standing more viable.House Republicans established a precedent for suing the White House over appropriationsHouse Democrats plan to sue the White House on the grounds that it is effectively bypassing Congress’s constitutional power of the pursethe same logic Republicans used in a 2014 lawsuit against the Obama administratioAt the time Republicans argued that officials had attempted to use federal funds that had not been approved by Congress to pay insurers under the Affordable Care Act. In that case a federal judgethat Republicans had the grounds to sue the White House because its efforts infringed on Congress’s authority over appropriations. Because Trump is now trying to reauthorize funds that were originally appropriated for other purposes legal experts say Democrats can once again use this same argument and emphasize that he’s circumventing Congress by doing so.House Democrats could also contest the status of the national emergency by arguing that it’s not actually an emergency at allthough experts have said that the lahas typically granted the president wide latitude to determine what an emergency is.Whichever arguments they ultimately use House Democrats are far from alone in making them.

737 Max software update: Boeing and FAA approval - VoLog In or Sign UBoeing’s effort to get the 737 Max approved to fly again explaineA bigger problem than a software update.Boeing’s effort to get the 737 Max approved to fly again explaineBoeing for the first time officially took responsibilittwo crashes of 737 Max jetClaiming responsibility was part of an attempt to get the planes approved to fly again. Boeing was trying to say that it now understands why the planes crashes — flawed software — and has a plan in place to replace it with new software that will eliminate the problem and persuade regulators to get the planes off the ground. But then Friday morning the company announced that it had found athat it also needs to fix and will somewhat delay the process of getting the planes cleared to fly again.All of which of course raises the question of why such flawed systems were allowed to fly in the first place.And that story begins nine years ago when Boeing was faced with a major threat to its bottom line spurring the airline to rush a series of kludges through the certification process — with an underresourced Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) seemingly all too eager to help an American company threatened by a foreign competitor rather than to ask tough questions about the project.The specifics of what happened in the regulatory system are still emerging (and despite executives’ assurances we don’t even really know what happened on the flights yet). But the big picture is coming into view: A major employer faced a major financial threat and short-term politics and greed won out over the integrity of the regulatory system. It’s a scandal.The 737 versus 320 rivalry explaineThere are lots of different passenger airplanes on the market but just two very similar narrow-body planes dominate domestic (or intra-European) travel. One is the European company with models called A318 A319 A320 or A321 depending on how long the plane is. These four variants by design have identical flight decks so pilots can betrained to fly them interchangeablThe 320 family competes with a group of planes that Boeing calls the 737 — there’s a 737-600 a 737-700 a 737-800 and a 737-900 — with higher numbers indicating larger planes. Some of them are also extended-range models that have an ER appended to the name and as you would probably guess they have longer ranges.Importantly even though there are many different flavors of 737 they are all in some sense the same plane just as all the 320 family planes are the same plane. Southwest Airlines for example simplifies its overall operations by exclusively flying different 737 variants.Both the 737 and the 320 come in lots of different flavors so airlines have plenty of options in terms of what kind of aircraft should fly exactly which route. But because there are only two players in this market and because their offerings are so fundamentally similar the competition for this slice of the plane market is both intense and weirdly limited. If one company were to gain a clear technical advantage over the other it would be a minor catastrophe for the losing company.And that’s what Boeing thought it was facing.The A320neo was trouble for BoeinJet fuel is a major cost for airlines. With labor costs largely driven by collective bargaining agreements and regulations that require minimum ratios of flight attendants per passenger fuel is the cost center airlines have the most capacity to do something about. Consequently improving fuel efficiency has emerged as one of the major bases of competition between airline manufacturers.If you roll back to 2010 it began to look like Boeing had a real problem in this regard.Airbus was coming out with an updated version of theA320 family that it called the A320ne with “neo” meaning “new engine option.” The new engines were going to be more fuel-efficient with a larger diameter than previous A320 engines that could nonetheless be mounted on what was basically the same airframe. This was a nontrivial engineering undertaking both in designing the new engines and in figuring out how to make them work with the old airframe but even though it cost a bunch of money it basically worked. And it raised the question of whether Boeing would respond.Initial word was that it wouldn’t. As CBS Moneywatch’sBrett Snyder wrote in December 201 the basic problem was that you couldn’slap the new generation of more efficient larger-diameter engines onto the 737:One of the issues for Boeing is that it takes more work to put new engines on the 737 than on the A320. The 737 is lower to the ground than the A320 and thenew engines have a larger diamete. So while both manufacturers would have to do work the Boeing guys would have more work to do to jack the airplane up. That will cost more while reducing commonality with the current fleet. As we know from last week reduced commonality means higher costs for the airlines as well.Under the circumstances Boeing’s best option was to just take the hit for a few years and accept that it was going to have to start selling 737s at a discount price while it designed a whole new airplane. That would of course be time-consuming and expensive and during the interim it would probably lose a bunch of narrow-body sales to Airbus.The original version of the 737 first flew in 1967 and a decades-old decision about how much height to leave between the wing and the runway left them boxed out of 21st-century engine technology — and there was simply nothing to be done about it.Boeing decided to put on the too-big engines anywayAs late as February 2011 Boeing chair and CEO James McNerney was sticking to the plan to design a totally new aircraft.“We’re not done evaluating this whole situation yet”he said on an analyst cal “but our current bias is to move to a newer airplane an all-new airplane at the end of the decade beginning of the next decade. It’s our judgment that our customers will wait for us.”But in August 2011 Boeing announced that it had lined up orders for496 re-engined Boeing 737 aircraft from five airlineIt’s not entirely clear what happened but reading between the lines it seems that in talking to its customers Boeing reached the conclusion that airlines would not wait for them. Some critical mass of carriers (American Airlines seems to have been particularly influential) was credible enough in its threat to switch to Airbus equipment that Boeing decided it needed to offer 737 buyers a Boeing solution sooner rather than later.Committing to putting a new engine that didn’t fit on the plane was the corporate version of the Fyre Festival’s“let’s just do it and be legends man”moment and it unsurprisingly wound up leading to a slew of engineering and regulatory problems.New engines on an old planAs the industry trade publication Leeham News and Analysis explained earlier in March Boeing engineers had beenworking on the concept that became the 737 Maeven back when the company’s plan was still not to build it.In a March 2011 interview with Aircraft Technology Mike Bair then the head of 737 product development said that reengineering was possible.“There’s been fairly extensive engineering work on it” he said. “We figured out a way to get a big enough engine under the wing.”The problem is that an airplane is a big complicated network of interconnected parts. To get the engine under the 737 wing engineers had to mount the engine nacelle higher and more forward on the plane. But moving the engine nacelle (and a related change to the nose of the plane) changed the aerodynamics of the plane such that the plane did not handle properly at a high. That in turn led to the creation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). It fixed the angle-of-attack problem in most situations but it created new problems in other situations when it made it difficult for pilots to directly control the plane without being overridden by the MCAS.On Wednesday Boeing rolled out a software patch that it says corrects the problem and it hopes to persuade the FAA to agree.But note that the underlying problem isn’t really software; it’s with the effort to use software to get around a whole host of other problems.1of x: BEST analysis of what really is happening on theissue from my brother in law who’s a pilot software engineer &amp; deep thinker. Bottom line don’t blame software that’s the band aid for many other engineering and economic forces in effect.Recall after all that the whole point of the 737 Max project was to be able to say that the new plane was the same as the old plane. From an engineering perspective the preferred solution was to actually build a new plane. But for business reasons Boeing didn’t want a “new plane” that would require a lengthy certification process and extensive (and expensive) new pilot training for its customers. The demand was for a plane that was simultaneously new and not new.But because the new engines wouldn’t fit under the old wings the new plane wound up having different aerodynamic properties than the old plane. And because the aerodynamics were different the flight control systems were also different. But treating the whole thing as a fundamentally different plane would have undermined the whole point. So the FAA and Boeing agreed to sort of fudge it.The new planes are pretty differenAs far as we can tell the 737 Max is a perfectly airworthy plane in the sense that error-free piloting allows it to be operated safely.But pilots of planes that didn’t crash kept noticing the same basic pattern of behavior that is suspected to have been behind the two crashes according to a Dallas Morning News review ofThe disclosures found by the News reference problems with an autopilot system and they all occurred during the ascent after takeoff. Many mentioned the plane suddenly nosing down. While records show these flights occurred in October and November the airlines the pilots were flying for is redacted from the database.These pilots all safely disabled the MCAS and kept their planes in the air. But one of the pilotsthat it was “unconscionable that a manufacturer the FAA and the airlines would have pilots flying an airplane without adequately training or even providing available resources and sufficient documentation to understand the highly complex systems that differentiate this aircraft from prior models.”The training piece is important because a key selling feature of the 737 Max was the idea that since it wasn’t really a new plane pilots didn’t really need to be retrained for the new equipment. As the New York Times reported “For many new airplane models pilots train for hours on giant multimillion-dollar machines on-the-ground versions of cockpits that mimic the flying experience and teach them new features” while the experienced 737 Max pilots were allowed light refresher courses that you could do on an iPad.That let Boeing get the planes into customers’ hands quickly and cheaply but evidently at the cost of increasing the possibility of pilots not really knowing how to handle the planes with dire consequences for everyone involved.The FAA put a lot of faith in BoeinIn a blockbuster March 17 report for the Seattle Times the newspaper’s aerospace reporter Dominic Gates details the extent to whichthe FAA delegated crucial evaluations of the 737’s safety to Boeing itsel. The delegation Gates explains is in part a story of a years-long process during which the FAA “citing lack of funding and resources has over the years delegated increasing authority to Boeing to take on more of the work of certifying the safety of its own airplanes.”But there are indications of failures that were specific to the 737 Max timeline. In particular Gates reports that “as certification proceeded managers prodded them to speed the process” and that “when time was too short for FAA technical staff to complete a review sometimes managers either signed off on the documents themselves or delegated their review back to Boeing.”Most of all decisions about what could and could not be delegated were being made by managers concerned about the timeline rather than by the agency’s technical experts.It’s not entirely clear at this point why the FAA was so determined to get the 737 cleared quickly (there will be more investigations) but if you recall the political circumstances of this period in Barack Obama’s presidency you can quickly get a general sense of the issue.Boeing is not just a big company with a significant lobbying presence in Washington; it’s a major manufacturing company with a strong global export presence and a source of many good-paying union jobs. In short it was exactly the kind of company the powers that be were eager to promote — with the Obama White House for example proudly going to bat for the Export-Import Bank as a key way to sustain America’s aerospace industry.A story about overweening regulators delaying an iconic American company’s product launch and costing good jobs compared to the European competition would have looked very bad. And the fact that the whole purpose of the plane was to be more fuel-efficient only made getting it off the ground a bigger priority. But the incentives really were reasonably aligned and Boeing has only caused problems for itself by cutting corners.Boeing is now in a bad situatioOne emblem of the whole situation is that as the 737 Max engineering team piled kludge on top of kludge they came up with athat would alert the pilots if the plane’s two angle-of-attack sensors disagreed.as Jon Ostrower reported for the Air Curren Boeing’s team decided to make the warning light an optional add-on like how car companies will upcharge you for a moon roof.light cost $80000 extra per planand neither Lion Air nor Ethiopian chose to buy it perhaps figuring that Boeing would not sell a plane (nor would the FAA allow it to) that was not basically safe to fly. In the wake of the crashes Boeing has decided to revisit this decision and make the light standard on all aircraft.Boeing has lost about $40 billion in stock market valuatiosince the crash so it’s not like cheating out on the warning light turned out to have been a brilliant business decision or anything.This fundamentally is one reason the FAA has become comfortable working so closely with Boeing on safety regulations: The nature of the airline industry is such that there’s no real money to be made selling airplanes that have a poor safety track record. One could even imagine sketching out a utopian libertarian argument to the effect that there’s no real need for a government role in certifying new airplanes at all precisely because there’s no reason to think it’s profitable to make unsafe ones.The real world of course is quite a bit different from that and different individuals and institutions face particular pressures that can lead them to take actions that don’t collectively make sense. Looking back Boeing probably wishes it had just stuck with the “build a new plane” plan and toughed out a few years of rough sales rather than ending up in the current situation. Right now the company is in effect trying to patch things up piecemeal — a software update here a new warning light there etc. — in hopes of persuading global regulatory agencies to let its planes fly again.But even once that’s done Boeing faces the task of convincing airlines to actually buy its planes. Aninformative David Ljunggren article for Reuterreminds us that a somewhat comparable situation arose in 1965 when three then-new Boeing 727 jetliners crashed.There wasn’t really anything unsound about the 727 planes but many pilots didn’t fully understand how to operate the new flaps — arguably a parallel to the MCAS situation with the 737 Max — which spurred some additional training and changes to the operation manual. Passengers avoided the planes for months but eventually came back as there were no more crashes and the 727 went on to fly safely for decades. Boeing hopes to have a similar happy ending to this saga but so far it seems to be a long way from that point. And the immediate future likely involves more tough questions.A political scandal on slow burThe 737 Max was briefly a topic of political controversy in the United States as foreign regulators grounded the planes but President Donald Trump — after speaking personally to Boeing’s CEO — declined to follow. Many members of Congress (from both parties) called on him to reconsider which he rather quickly did pushing the whole topic off Washington’s front burner.But Trump is generally friendly to Boeing (he even has a former Boeing executive Patrick Shanahan serving asacting defense secretary despite an ongoing ethics inquirinto charges that Shanahan unfairly favors his former employer) and Republicans are generally averse to harsh regulatory crackdowns. The most important decisions in the mix appear to have been made back during the Obama administration so it’s also difficult for Democrats to go after this issue. Meanwhile Washington has been embroiled in wrangling over special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and a new health care battlefield opened up as well.That said on March 27 FAA officials faced the Senate Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Aviation and Space at a hearing called by subcommittee Chair Ted Cruz (R-TX). Regulators committed at the hearing torevamp the way they certify new plane in light of the flaws that were revealed in the previous certification process.The questions at stake however are now much bigger than one subcommittee. Billions of dollars are on the line for Boeing the airlines that fly 737s and the workers who build the planes. And since a central element of this story is the credibility of the FAA’s process — in the eyes of the American people and of foreign regulatory agencies — it almost certainly won’t get sorted out without more involvement from the actual decision-makers in the US government.Boeing 737 Max scandal: news and updateBoeing’s effort to get the 737 Max approved to fly again explainePreliminary report on Ethiopia crash finds pilots followed Boeing’s procedures properlBarcelona’s remarkable history of rebirth and transformatioCars dominate cities today.

He’s put forward policies on everything from reducing the nicotine levels in cigarettes to lowering drug prices by getting more generic options on the market.“I never felt my public health agenda was at odds with the administration or broader philosophy” he said. “I have had really good support from the White House and from the department [of Health and Human Services] for what we’ve done.”Now even in his last week in office he’s calling for more regulation of the vaping industry — and especially companies that’ve marketed to young people like Juul.A crackdown on Juul-like products may be necessary to curb the “addiction crisis” Gottlieb saythat looks like a USB drive and vaporizes a liquid that contains nicotine salts through e-liquid “pods.” Each pod contains as much nicotine as at least one pack of cigarettes and its nicotine salts are absorbed into the body at almost the same speed as nicotine in regular cigarettes which is why officials worry Juul may be more addictive than other e-cigarettes.Though the company has repeatedly stated that it’s in the business of helping adult smokers to quit Juul’s early marketing campaign —blasted out through social media often featuring youth influencers and young people partyin—  tells a different story.“If you go back and look at their marketing campaigns from 2015 and 16” Gottlieb said “it’s hard not to look at that marketing and conclude that’s it’s not going to be appealing to a youth to a teenager. It certainly in my view had some impact on creating the problem we have now.”But Gottlieb’s early record at FDA on e-cigarettes was somewhat mixed. he delayed the compliance deadline for theto 2022. This gave the industry five more years to file public health applications that show that their products are safe alternatives to conventional cigarettes and that they weren’t unduly targeting minors. Gottlieb positioned the delay as a way to give manufacturers time to get in step with the new laws while ensuring smokers had access to cigarette alternatives that could save their lives.Some public health advocates viewed the move as a giveaway for the vaping industry and a chance for e-cigarette makers to further expand their market share among kids at a time when e-cigarette in teens has far. For these reasons health groupsand sent a letter to Gottlieasking the FDA to begin to regulate e-cigarette products like other cigarettes immediately.Since then as data about rising teen vaping levels piled up Gottlieb moved to restrict the sale of flavored e-cigarette products to young people and asked companies to take voluntary steps to withdraw them. Vaping advocates have criticized these moves saying the FDA might make it harder for smokers to access e-cigarettes for smoking cessation.Looking ahead Gottlieb said concerns about youth vaping should take priority over concerns about smokers if adolescent vaping rates continue to rise. “This is now an addiction crisis and it’s going to take time to reverse. I don’t anticipate we’re going to see a decline in youth use of e-cigarettes this year.”“Does e-cigarette use among adolescents go up 10 percent or 40 percent? If it goes up 40 percent we’re going to step in with additional regulatory steps and take more dramatic action to address the access of these products to kids” Gottlieb said.When asked what that might look like Gottlieb suggested the broad category of e-cigarette products Juul is part of — known as “pod mods” — could be the focus of regulatory action.“If [e-cigarette companies] cant keep these [products] out of the hands of kids to a better degree than they’re doing now these products are no longer going to be marketed.”There’s one other blemish on Gottlieb’s otherwise respectable track record. The opioid epidemic has continued to worsen during the last two years. While Gottlieb’s actions were generally lauded by opioid experts as he was also criticized for failing to approve the opioid overdose treatmentfor over-the-counter use and for bringing to market yet anotherdespite concerns about its potential for abuse.Despite those concerns however his resignation was still generally viewed as a loss for public health.Gottlieb plans to return to the American Enterprise Institute a conservative think tank to focus on the. He’s repeatedly denied his reasons for resigning are anything more than thepersonal desire to spend more time with famil. For now we know that Ned Sharpless the current director of the National Cancer Institute will be replacing him as interim FDA chief.Gottlieb hopes the next commissioner will build on his legacy — and believes the Trump administration will help that person do so.“Secretary Azar [at HHS] has been extremely supportive of our efforts to reduce death and disease from tobacco [and] my recent efforts to keep these products out of the hands of kids. I expect [Azar] to continue to be a strong champion.”Vaping: the astonishing surge in e-cigarette useScott Gottlieb’s last word as FDA chief: Juul drove a youth addiction crisiNicotine-induced seizures could be a side effect of vapinDrug-resistant “superbugs” are spreading — but your hospital doesn’t have to tell yoIt’s not your imagination.

Howard Schultz town hall: What Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are up to instead - VoLog In or Sign UHoward Schultz hasn’t gotten into policy specifics. Here are 4 ideas from women candidates who have.Harris Klobuchar Warren and Gillibrand have ideas.Howard Schultz hasn’t gotten into policy specifics. Here are 4 ideas from women candidates who have.Howard Schultz speaks to students at Purdue University in February 2019.“Why am I here and why am I considering doing this?”asked during a town hall event on Thursday hosted by Fox News.That’s what a lot of other people are wondering too.The former Starbucks CEO is mulling running for office as a centrist independent. A third-party candidate has never won a presidential election in the United States but Schultz seems to believe he’s the exception — and because he’s a billionaire he can fund his bid himself.During the Fox News town hall hosted by Martha MacCallum and Brett Baier Schultz tried to make the case that an independent bid makes sense — he claimed that he could run a competitive race and potentially win Electoral College votes in more than 40 states. He answered questions from the audience on a variety of issues though he didn’t get into many details in the one-hour event.He talked about abortion (he’s pro-choice) health care (he thinks prices are too high) trade (he’d get back into the Trans-Pacific Partnership) and the Iran deal (he’d think about it getting back into that one too) among other issues. He also complained a lot about polarization and a need for a return to civility.In one answer Schultz suggested he could solve immigration by bringing Democrats and Republicans into a room and telling them “you cannot come in here with ideology and ego.” They’d then negotiate in front of an empty chair representing the American people Schultz continued echoingClint Eastwood’s 2012 RNC playbooHoward Schultz's plan for immigration is to put an empty chair in a room and tell politicians the chair represents the American peopleSchultz was also asked if he would commit to tapping a woman as his running mate. He wouldn’t but he touted his record on gender. “I am a strong proponent of women and I am excited to see so many women who are running for president” he said.In terms of policy specifics this might be the most we’ve gotten from Schultz thus far but he still largely spoke in generalities and offered up vague ideas. The women in the race however have been cranking out policy and doing the work.So instead of outlining Schultz’s non-answers and vague policy proposals I thought I’d take the opportunity to highlight some of the women in the 2020 race and some of the policies they’ve rolled out instead.Howard Schultz has been to China a lot. Elizabeth Warren has a policy package to help America’s farms.One audience member asked Schultz about what he would do to help United States farmers especially in light of Trump’s trade aggressions with China. Schultz pointed out that he’s been to China a lot and said he’d try to get back into the Trans-Pacific Partnershipthe multi-country trade deal Trump pulled the US out of in 201Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in March rolled out a broad set of proposals aimed at boosting America’s small farmers and helping protect them from corporations and big agribusiness.As Vox’s Matt Yglesias laid ou a lot of what Warren laid out is related to antitrust policy: she would appoint regulators to review and reverse mergers that hurt competition such as the Bayer-Monsanto tie-up and scrutinize big agribusinesses that have become vertically integrated and exert too much market control.And as Yglesias explained there’s even more:She also wants to restrict the ability of commodity checkoff programs (organizations like the Egg Board the National Pork Board etc.) to engage in anti-competitive practices. And she’s promising to copy Trump’s aggressive use of discretionary presidential authority over trade to force Canada and Mexico to go back to accepting country-of-origin labeling that would distinguish American livestock from foreign livestock.Last but by no means least she proclaims her support for an Iowa law that sought to prevent foreigners from buying American farmland and says she will “use all available tools to restrict foreign ownership of American agriculture companies and farmland” as well as deploying the federal government’s ability to crack down on various loopholes foreigners can exploit to get around the law.Schultz wants young people to get a job. Kirsten Gillibrand backs a federal jobs guarantee.During the Fox News town hall Schultz stressed the importance of young people getting their first job — the types of jobs he presumably provided at Starbucks. He warned that if young people don’t get a first job between the ages of 17 and 19 “bad things happen” and he wants to make sure “the first job is linked to opportunities that young people in America need.”Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) is also into jobs. Jobs for everyone in fact.in 2018 the New York Democrat and 2020 contender said she is behind a government-backed jobs guarantee.“Guaranteed jobs programs creating floors for wages and benefits and expanding the right to collectively bargain are exactly the type of roles that government must take to shift power back to workers and our communities” she said. “Corporate interests have controlled the agenda in Washington for decades so we can’t tinker at the margins and expect to rebuild the middle class and stamp out inequality. We need to get back to an economy that rewards workers not just shareholder value and CEO pay.” the idea of a jobs guarantee is gaining steam among Democrats. But it’s a complicated subject. Some Americans are uncomfortable with the idea of the government taking such a big role in the labor market and it’s not clear what a “good job” for everyone in the country would be. Gillibrand is taking part in a CNN town hall next week.Howard Schultz thinks there are “two economies in America today.” Kamala Harris has the LIFT the Middle Class Act.Schultz on Thursday said he gives Trump “credit for the economy being robust for many many Americans” but acknowledged the Republican tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited corporations and the wealthy probably wasn’t the best idea and he’d rather do something for the middle class. “We have an economy that is bifurcated” he said.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) last year announced the Livable Incomes for Families Today the Middle Class Actor the LIFT the Middle Class Ac which would give the middle class and working families a tax credit.Single people would get $3000 a year or $250 per month and married couples would get $6000 a year or $500 per month. The credit would be phased out for single people who make over $50000 and for couples or single people with children who make more than $100000. It would cost about what the 2017 Republican tax cuts did.It walks right up to the line of being a universal basic income proposal without quite getting thereIt’s a big expansion of the safety net. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that it would lift 9 million people out of poverty. And not for nothing but it’s arguably the closest thing that any 2020 contender has proposed to a an idea that is exactly what it sounds like: a guaranteed cash benefit to every American. Harris’s office claims 80 million total Americans would benefit in some way. That’s not everyone as under a true UBI but it’s a big step.Howard Schultz grew Starbucks. Amy Klobuchar has a new infrastructure plan.Schultz talked about his success at Starbucks on Thursday a lot. He said former Defense Secretary Robert Gates being on Starbucks’s board of directors helped him learn about the military. He touted his “entrepreneurial leadership” to help grow the business. The whole thing almost seemed like a marketing ploy for Starbucks but then again that’s what we thought about Trump’s 2016 run for a while too.How that experience would transfer to infrastructure didn’t come up on Thursday but Sen. Amy Klobucharunveiled a $1 trillion infrastructure investment package last weeKlobuchar’s campaign described the proposal in aand said it will be her “top budget priority” and something she focuses on in the first year of her presidency. It entails more than $650 billion in federal funding for infrastructure including rural broadband municipal waterworks school construction airports mass transit highways and bridges among other areas.The plan would also establish an independent nonpartisan Infrastructure Financing Authority that would help states and localities use private funds better and maintain infrastructure. And the proposal would put a $25 billion seed investment in an infrastructure bank that would help state and local governments get $200 to $300 billion in direct loans loan guarantees and other credit formats for projects.Klobuchar says she would pay for the proposals with a “series of corporate tax reforms” including adjusting the corporate tax rate to 25 percent. (The Republican tax bill put it at 21 percent.) Schultz says he would also put the corporate tax rate at 25 percent — or 26 percent. It’s not quite clear what he’d do with that money though.The news moves fast. Catch up at the end of the day: Subscribe to Vox’s daily news podcast or sign up for our evening email newsletterRep.

Trump’s Mar-a-Lago security and Chinese spies spark concerns - VoLog In or Sign UWhat’s going on with Mar-a-Lago and Chinese spies explaineFederal authorities are reportedly probing potential Chinese spying efforts at Trump’s Palm Beach resort.What’s going on with Mar-a-Lago and Chinese spies explainePresident Donald Trump speaks at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in April 2018.Concerns about security and the level of access to President Donald Trump at his private Florida clubhave been swirling since he was elected but scrutiny kicked into high gear after the US Secret Service arrested a Chinese woman Yujing Zhang who they say was carrying four cellphones and a malware-infected thumb drive at the resort over the weekend. a federal counterintelligence probe into possible Chinese intelligence operations targeting Trump spearheaded by the FBI was already underway and now it’s been “turbo-charged.”The probe is also looking at Li “Cindy” Yang a Florida massage parlor owner whoto President Trump and his family. According to the Herald the investigation is a broader probe into Chinese nationals doing business in the area and predates both the revelations about Yang and Zhang’s entry attempt.This isn’t the first time concerns about potential lax security around the president or his accessibility at Mar-a-Lago have been raised. Shortly after his inauguration for example Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeto a North Korean ballistic missile test within full view and earshot of Mar-a-Lago guests.In the wake of this latest gaffe the Secret Service has essentiallyand said it’s up to Mar-a-Lago not them to figure out who gets in and who doesn’t.But that hasn’t stopped the FBI —— from asking questions about what’s going on there.A Chinese woman was arrested after getting access to Mar-a-LagHere’s why this is all being talked about now: On Saturday Zhang a 32-year-old Chinese woman Zhang approached a Secret Service agent around noon and presented two Chinese passports saying she wanted to go to the pool. The agent confirmed her identity and tried to figure out if she was on the access list for the club.A manager on duty confirmed that there was someone with the last name Zhang who was a member of the club but Zhang “did not give a definitive answer” when asked if that was her father. She also wouldn’t say if she was there to meet with anyone but because of a “potential language barrier issue” Mar-a-Lago believed her to be a relative of the club member and let her in.Zhang was let onto the grounds and once there was asked by a receptionist why she was there. She finally said she was there for a United Nations Chinese American Association event that evening.But the event didn’t exist. That’s when it all began to unravel.Another Secret Service agent then came into contact with Zhang; she told the agent she was there to attend a United Nations friendship event and presented the agent with a supposed invitation but it was in Chinese. There was also no such event scheduled. The agent told Zhang she wasn’t allowed on the grounds during which time according to the complaint she “became verbally aggressive with agents” and was detained.Agents later searched her belongings and found four cellphones a hard drive a laptop and a malware-infected USB drive. Zhang was arrested and charged with lying to a federal agent and knowingly entering a restricted area.The incident has heightened concerns about the potential national security risks presented by Mar-a-Lagoin a statement on Tuesdasaid it “does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar-a-Lago” and that it’s instead the responsibility of the host entity.“The Mar-a-Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property. This access does not afford an individual proximity to the President or other Secret Service protectees” the statement read.“In such instances additional screening and security measures are employed” it continued. “With the exception of certain permanently protected facilities such as the White House the practice used at Mar-a-Lago is no different than that long-used at any other site temporarily visited by the President or other Secret Service protectees.”Also in response to Saturday’s incident Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Mark Warner sent ato FBI Director Christopher Wray (and copied the director of national intelligence and Secret Service director) urging the bureau to “immediately assess national security risks” at the president’s properties.“This latest incident raises very serious questions regarding security vulnerabilities at Mar-a-Lago which foreign intelligence services have reportedly targeted” they wrote.This has been bubbling for a whilZhang’s arrest comes on the heels of reports about Yang the Chinese woman who had reportedly been selling access to Trump.published a report in March detailing Yang’s activities which Vox’s Ella Nilsen summed up at the time:Yang got direct access to Trump herself at least two times posing with the president at his annual Super Bowl watch party last month at Mar-a-Lago and snapping a picture with him at a separate Republican National Committee fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago last March.Yang had to pay $5000for her March 2018 dinner and photo with the president.She also founded a company called GY US Investments that promised businesspeople from China access to the White House and Capitol Hill. GY US Investments promised to broker visits at places including the White House Mar-a-Lago and the annual shareholder meeting of Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathawayaccording to the New York TimeYang also used to own the Florida massage parlor whereNew England Patriots owner Robert Kraft is accused of having solicited seas part of a prostitution ring sting.published a report ahead of the Times story about Yang gaining access to Trump and her political engagement after 2016.the FBI to dig into the reports about Yang and her activities. In a March congressional Democrats said the allegations “raise serious counterintelligence concerns.”“China has frequently used non-traditional intelligence collectors and businesspersons to compromise targets” Democrats wrote. They requested that the FBI conduct “criminal and counterintelligence investigations into credible allegations of potential human trafficking as well as unlawful foreign lobbying campaign finance and other activities by Yang.”Trump says he’s not worried about Chinese spying at Mar-a-LagTrump was asked by reporters on Wednesday whether he’s worried the Chinese might be trying to spy at Mar-a-Lago. He said he’d seen the story and had had a brief meeting but largely brushed it off.“No I’m not concerned at all” he said. “We have very good control.”But Trump and all of us should be worried. Peter Harrell an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Securityhe would be surprised if China and other adversarial governmentstrying to get into Mar-a-Lago and the president’s other properties. “There’s a huge trove of information available” he said.Trump often visits Mar-a-Lago on the weekends and is known to drop in on events and chat with guests. He moves freely around the grounds and invites other politicians members of his administration and foreigners to go there with him. And as mentioned he’s not opposed to having some pretty sensitive talks out in the open and in front of guests.It’s not clear whether any malicious actors have been successful in potential espionage efforts at Mar-a-Lago but it’s likely they’re trying. And Mar-a-Lago doesn’t seem to be making it particularly difficult.The news moves fast.

Trump’s creepy Biden tweet illustrates his utter shamelessness - VoLog In or Sign UTrump of all people tries to score political points on Biden’s treatment of womeThe utter shamelessness of the Trump administration in one tweet.Trump of all people tries to score political points on Biden’s treatment of womeLess than two months ago Alva Johnson a former Trump campaign staffer came forwardto accuse Donald Trump of kissing her without her consenin 2016. In so doing Johnson became the 16th womanto accuse the president of groping kissing or assaulting he. At least seven additional women haveaccused Trump of sexual harassmenBeyond the slew of accusations Trump was infamously recordedbragging about groping women on a hot mi. When his remarks were published by the Washington Post in October 2016 Trump issued a perfunctory apology and downplayed it as “locker room talk” but the behavior he boasted about reflects the accounts of many of his accusers.If you thought any of that would have persuaded Trump to forgo trying to score points against his political opponents based on accusations of inappropriate behavior however think again. On Thursday afternoon Trump tweeted out doctored footage of Joe Biden that’s meant to mock the former vice president for a video he shared the day before. In the original video Biden responded toaccusations he repeatedly invaded women’s personal spacby promising “to be much more mindful.”In the video Trump tweeted Biden is shown grabbing himself on the shoulders and kissing himself on the head — the same sort of inappropriately handsy behavior the former vice president is now reckoning with.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Trump’s decision to try to capitalize on accusations of inappropriate behavior despite all of the allegations against him illustrates the sheer shamelessness of his administration. And it’s not just the president. During a Fox News interview last Sunday White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said video of Biden’s “creepy” behavior would be “a big problem” for him if he ran for president completely ignoring the fact that her boss has been accused of far worse.: If anybody just types in “Creepy Uncle Joe Videos” you come up with a treasure trove…I think Joe Biden has a big problem here because he calls it affection and handshakes his party calls it completely inappropriate.None of this is meant to defend Biden. The video he posted on Wednesday stops short of apologizing for his behavior and his line that “[s]ocial norms are changing” obfuscates the fact that at least two women — Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos — accused him ofconduct they say was inappropriate at the tim not just in hindsight. If Biden decides to run in the first post-#MeToo presidential election his treatment of women will rightfully be something he has to answer for. But Trump is definitely not in a position to make a good faith case against him.So if Trump isn’t genuinely concerned about the treatment of women what’s the point of his tweet? One likely possibility: ending Biden’s candidacy before it officially begins.

Border news: Trump announces no closure but slowdowns at ports continue - VoLog In or Sign UThe border shutdown was a reality show threat but the border slowdown is reaAdd “residents of border communities” to the list of people whose lives Trump is using as leverage.The border shutdown was a reality show threat but the border slowdown is reaThe San Ysidro border crossing connecting San Diego California and Tijuana Mexico is the busiest port of entry along the US-Mexico border. Slowdowns have hit several ports as port officers are reassigned to care for migrants in Border Patrol custody.President Trump having successfully squeezed several news cycles out of a will-he-or-won’t-he reality show drama over his threats tobetween the United States and Mexico has apparently decided he prefers threatening to close the border over actually moving to do it.On Thursday Trump announced that he wouldn’t close the border imminently but said it was on the table if Mexico didn’t “stop or largely stop” drugs and unauthorized immigrants from coming into the US.The announcement matters for US businesses (and people) who were worried about an imminent shutdown. But it doesn’t actually change the fact that on the ground there already is a slowdown at ports of entry — for the same reason that officials not named Trump were saying port closures might be needed to begin with.And the past week has shown that using a border shutdown as a threat to get other people to do what Trump wants — especially when Trump isn’t exactly defining his goals in a realistic way — affects Americans whether or not there is ever an actual announcement that “the border” is closed.There is already a border slowdown and Trump’s declaration doesn’t change thaTrump’s threats of shutting down “the border” were always only a threat to shut down US ports of entry — official border crossings where people cars and trucks can come legally into the US. He can’t stop people from crossing into the US between ports of entry illegally and he can’t stop such people from seeking asylum in the US once they’ve set foot on US soil. (The administration has already tried to ban people who enter the US illegally from seeking asylum and got held up in court.)And even at ports what Trump talks about as an on/off switch — closing the border or not closing it — is really a dimmer: the possibility of reducing staff or shutting down lanes at individual ports of entry.That switch is already dimmed.DHS is already reassigning some staff from working at ports to supporting US Border Patrol officials in the care and processing of apprehended migrants. On Monday Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen ordered 750 port staff to be reassigned and directed Customs and Border Protection (which oversees both ports and Border Patrol) to look into the possibility of shifting as many as 2000 port officers.For everyone in Trump’s administration other than Trump that was the basis for talking about closing ports of entry entirely. While Trump talked about it as a bargaining chip administration officials talked about it as a necessary act of logistics.“Why are we talking about closing the border?”acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney aske(rhetorically) in a Sunday interview on ABC. “Not for spite and not to — not to try and — and undo what’s happening but to simply say look we need the people from the ports of entry to go out and patrol in the desert.”The reassignment of hundreds of officers has caused unusual slowdowns at various ports over the past few days. On Monday the port crossing at Otay Mesa in California closed for the night with 150 trucks waiting to cross; on Wednesday lines to cross into El Paso from Ciudad Juarez were so long that the local government of Juarez brought port-a-potties to relieve people waiting.Bridge wait times are so long at the Bridge of the Americas that Juarez has brought in port-a-potties for anyone stuck in traffic. (Courtesy: Beto Delgado)The ports along the border that are affected and vary from day to day. That makes sense given that the reason for the shutdown is reallocating staff hours. More importantly it makes sense if the administration is trying to minimize the disruption to trade and legal border crossings.Declaring flatly that the border is “closed” would do the exact opposite — it would have maximized the disruption.That’s consistent with the way Trump talks about closing the border: as a threat to get everybody else to comply with what he wants.Trump uses border closure as a bargaining chiAt first Trump was attempting to pitch a border closure as an affirmatively good thing for the US saying it would benefit the American economy because of the trade deficit (which is economically illiterate).He later stopped doing that — acknowledging what have reportedly been repeated briefings from top White House economic staff explaining to him that it would be a very bad idea for American businesses as well as Mexican ones.Instead he’s now explicitly calling it a bargaining chip.“If we don’t make a deal with Congress or if Mexico — and probably you can say ‘and/or’” — if Mexico doesn’t do what they should be doing” by stopping people from coming Trump said Tuesday “then we’re going to close the border. That’s going to be it.”In that respect his announcement Thursday that he wouldn’t close the border was barely a reprieve. Because what Trump is demanding in return — that Mexico stop or “largely stop” drugs and migrants from entering the US — is at worst impossible and at best impossible to define.The Mexican government has generally cooperated with the Trump administration on migration (and has been stepping up its interdictions of migrants over the past week days before Trump acknowledged that Mexico was “for the first time” stopping migrants) but it’s impossible to stop everyone from coming to the US. While Mexico’s administration initially granted large numbers of temporary visas to Central American migrants to travel legally through Mexico en route to the US when President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office in December they stopped that policy after a month — and the number of families coming to the US has only spiked since then.Trump is essentially asking that Mexico do something in a year that it’s been trying and failing to do for the past 15 years: eradicate human and drug smuggling in the country. And because he’s not clarifying what “largely stop” means he’s raising the chance that Mexico could do everything possible and still not please him.It’s hard to successfully use threats to get your way if you’re not clear about what exactly you want.Trump has done this before. His efforts to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program featured a six-month period for Congress to take legislative action to help the 700000 young unauthorized immigrants DACA protected from deportation before those expirations began to expire en masse. Those negotiations were already falling apart before a federal judge stepped in and stopped Trump from ending DACA (a court battle the Supreme Court is almost certain to take up next term).Now DACA is in a zombie state in which unauthorized immigrants who had DACA protections before Trump tried to rescind them are allowed to keep renewing but are forced to continually consider how to maximize the time they’ll be protected if the Supreme Court sides with Trump.Hundreds of thousands of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are in an even more dire position. They too are protected by a court ruling that stopped Trump from ending their legal status. But if a future court ruling goes against them some could lose protections immediately if that’s what the administration chooses to do.Just last week Trump made the decision to extend a similar set of protections to hundreds of Somali immigrants just days before they were set to lose their status. And now he’s giving Mexico — and everyone who lives works or trades along the US-Mexico border — a similar “reprieve.”The uncertainty itself matters. Mexican growers and the US businesses that import their produce will be forced for the next year to think about whether they should plan for a border closure in spring of 2020 or whether they should go on with business as usual and risk catastrophic losses if the border is closed. People who live in Mexico but work in the US will spend a year wondering if they’ll be able to get to work come next April — just like the DACA and TPS recipients who wonder if they’re going to be able to keep their jobs or whether they’ll have to be fired once they lose their permission to work legally in the US.Trump thinks of threats as leverage. But they’re only leverage because they cause pain.Rep.

Herman Cain: Trump plans to escalate Trumpification of Fed Reserve - VoLog In or Sign UTrump plans to nominate a second loyalist to the Fed: Herman CaiTrump is rapidly Trumpifying America’s central bank.Trump plans to nominate a second loyalist to the Fed: Herman CaiCain speaks at an Americans for Prosperity rally in Reno Nevada in July 2012.For the second time in a month President Donald Trump is reportedly set to make a controversial nomination to the Federal Reserve Board.Thursday that Trump plans to fill a seat on the monetary policy-making board with Herman Cain a Republican presidential candidate during the 2012 cycle who briefly led in the primary polls while touting ahas since used his email list to grift peoplTrump is reportedly waiting until Cain’s background check is complete to make an official announcement. That may end up complicating matters as Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by— allegations that along withrevelations of a long-term extramarital affai prompted him to end his presidential campaign in December 2011.Trump — who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 20 women — defended Cain when the allegations against Cain were in the news in late 2011 telling Fox News at the time that his accusers “probably do love their names splashed across the front pages. … I think Herman should take very very strong action even if he has to bring a major lawsuit against the women.”News that Trump plans to nominate Cain comes less than a month afterhe announced that he plans to fill another opening on the board with Stephen Moor an economic commentator who is perhaps best known for playing a staunch Trump loyalist on CNN.Cain like Moore has close ties to Trump. Last September Cain co-founded a pro-Trump Super PAC. Its homepage features a photo of Trump with the text “We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.”Cain is actually more qualified for the job than Moore. From 1992 to 1996 he served as director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.As far as economic policy goes Cain is perhaps best known for his “9-9-9” tax proposal which would’ve replaced the US tax system with a flat tax of 9 percent on businesses personal income and sales.Cain has recently spoken out against the Fed interest rate increaseNews that Trump plans to nominate Cain came hours after Trump posted his latest tweet criticizing the Fed for the interest rate hikes it implemented during his first two years in office.Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed the Economy is looking very strong the China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely there is little or no Inflation and USA optimism is very high!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Though the Fed announced last month that rates would hold steady for now Trump is apparently still unhappy with Chair Jerome Powell. Axios reports that Trump regards his selection of Powell “as one of the greatest mistakes of his administration. He has told aides that Powell has no ‘feel’ for the markets and compares him to a golfer who cannot putt.”As late as December 2017 Cain publicly said he regarded the Fed’s policy of gradual rate hikes as “good news.” But he’s since brought his view into alignment with Trump asin a January report that broke news about Cain being under consideration for a Fed seat:He told Bloomberg News in an interview that he’s concerned the Fed was overly aggressive with interest rate increases in the last year but didn’t respond to follow-up questions about his column defending higher rates.“I am not as afraid of inflation as I am of deflation” he said. “You can stop inflation faster than you can decelerate in deflation mode.”Moore has also fretted publicly about “deflation” even though it’s not actually occurring.That however doesn’t seem to matter much to the president who regularly blames raising interest rates for any less-than-exemplary economic trends.Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3.0% GDP &amp; Stock Market would have both been much higher &amp; World Markets would be in a better place!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)In waiting for Cain’s background check to be completed before making his nomination official Trump is doing more to vet him than he did with Moore.that Trump impulsively decided to nominate Moore over lunch after his chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow showed him a Wall Street Journal op-ed Moore had co-written titled “The Fed Is a Threat to Growt.” (Kudlow is a friend of Moore’s andalso has a long history of being very wrong about economic policTrump announced his intention to nominate Moore in a tweet on March 22. Within days news broke that Mooreowed the federal government $75000 in unpaid taxeand was held in contempt in 2012 forfailure to pay $300000 in alimonThe chain of events is reminiscent of what happened about a year ago with Ronny Jackson Trump’s former White House physician and onetime choice to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Shortly after Trump announced Jackson as his pick to lead the VAabout him drinking on the job and mistreating staff. Jackson’s nomination was eventually pulled. More recently in February Trump’s pick for United Nations ambassador Heather Nauertwithdrew from consideration for the joamid reports that she employed a nanny who was in the country legally but didn’t have a proper work permit.Nominees to the Fed must be approved by the Senate.

Trump inquiry: House Democrats explain why it’s taken 3 months to authorize subpoenas - VoLog In or Sign UHouse Democrats explain why it’s taken 3 months to authorize subpoenas into TrumAmericans want House Democrats to investigate Trump and his administration. Here’s why House Democrats aren’t rushing to it.House Democrats explain why it’s taken 3 months to authorize subpoenas into TrumHouse Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) speaks with Chair Jerrold Nadler (left) during a vote on issuing a subpoena to the Justice Department.House Democrats finally authorized subpoenas this week to get the. They got serious aboutrelated to the White House security clearance process and the administration’s effort to put a citizenship question on the census.But this all comes three months into Democratic control of the House of Representatives. For many liberals watching it’s about damn time.This was exacerbated by House Oversight Chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD) telling ABC News that while he will issue subpoenas he doesn’t “want to be issuing” them. His comments weren’t well received by those critical of the Trump administration.For two years Democrats watched Republicans skirt oversight responsibilities and campaigned on holding Trump and his administration accountable. After all the biggest difference between a House minority and a House majority isI really don't understand the reluctance. I don't understand any part of this approach of spending two years rightly warning the public about the dangers of an unchecked Trump administration then agonizing over doing anything about it like it was all a ruse.House Democrats insist this seemingly slow walk to subpoena territory is all part of the strategy. They say they want to give the White House a chance to comply with their requests voluntarily. But the Trump administration has clearly been reluctant to turn over anything — whether officials for testimony or key documents — something Democrats are calling a clear attempt to stonewall major investigations into the president his administration his businesses and his family.Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-MD) who chairs the House Oversight subcommittee on government operations said he understands the want for urgency but called it a “balancing act.”“We aren’t going to conquer Rome in a day. I think we need to try to make a public case and bring as much of the public along with us in terms of why we are doing what we are doing and what we are doing.”Although they started issuing some serious requests they’re stillwaiting on key documents from the Trump administratioon what went wrong in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria; they’re waiting on testimonies from White officials about security clearances; they’re waiting on more information aboutTrump’s national emergency declaration on the southern borde. The list goes on.“It’s still very early in this new Congress we are trying to show prudence and responsibility” said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) who sits on the House Judiciary Committee and is rumored to be weighing a presidential bid.House Democrats agree they’re approaching investigations methodicallPeople attend a protest the day after President Donald Trump forced the resignation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In conversations several House Democrats on the Oversight and Judiciary Committee seem to agree: House Democrats have to be methodical and judicious with how they address their investigations into the Trump administration they say. They’re not going to rush into anything.But the perceived wisdom behind this strategy is varied; some say it’s about building a legal case others are trying to make a moral argument about taking the high road in investigations.1) They want to get support from the publiThere’s an overwhelming consensus that the way House Democrats are approaching these investigations has to do with how they are viewed by the public. They see a mandate in the 2018 elections flipping more than 40 seats to claim the majority but it’s clear that there is emphasis being put on the scales of public opinion.“This approach is critical to earn the trust and confidence of independent voters in a very polarized time” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) who also sits on the House Oversight committee adding that it’s important that House Democrats work is perceived as Congress’ constitutional duty and not just an attempt to “score partisan points on the president.”A January poll from theWashington Post and ABC showed a majority of Americans supporHouse Democrats’ investigations into Trump’s 2016 campaign foreign relationships and personal financial ties and records. It’s less clear if the public is up to speed on the specifics of authorizing subpoenas or whether they are paying attention at all.Nonetheless Democrats see wisdom in doing this methodically.“Republicans in sort of uniformly opposing subpoenas forget that every time we have a debate it gives us opportunity to make the case with the public and if you look at the polling data we are winning with that debate” Connolly said.But Connolly said it’s important that “people can see we are not just rushing into [it] and just being trigger-happy with subpoenas.”2) They want to build a stronger legal case if they’re challenged in courThen there is the understanding that some of House Democrats’ requests may end up in court — particularlyrequests for Trump’s tax return. The House Ways and Means Committeefinally requested them Wednesday nigh starting what will likely be a lengthy legal fight.That same concern is playing out over the Mueller report.“As I understand it legally it’s best if we give a period of accommodation to the Attorney General that would be important if it’s challenged in court so we should be giving him a period to comply” Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) who sits on the Judiciary Committee said of the decision to wait between authorizing subpoenas for the Mueller report and issuing them.Of Democrats’ strategy around investigations overall Cohen was clear: “I think we should be whatever the law allows us to” he said. “I think we should be aggressive but within the limits knowing that this could end up in court that we don’t get jeopardized in court.”3) There’s an element of moral high grounUnderlying it all is a feeling that Democrats are taking the moral high ground.“We don’t like that they act that way; why do we want to act the way they do?” Swalwell said. “We respect the rule of law. They don’t. So I think it’s about not reducing ourselves to what we despise about the way they act.”House Democrats have broad oversight authoritSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) leads a House with broad oversight authority.That House Democrats would investigate Trump was baked into the 2018 midterm elections. Trump allies predicted a White House “” according to the Washington Post.And the oversight authorities are broad. Of course congressional committees can’t bring criminal charges but they can reveal misconduct.As Jeff Hauser who runs the transparency and accountability group Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic Policy and Researchpenned in an October op-ed for the Hil Democrats could really claim an agenda around oversight:Wonder whether Robert Mercer’s hedge fund Renaissance Technologies is getting afrom Trump’s IRS? Demand the records from the IRS as Trump’s tax returns are not the only billionaire’s tax returns subject to congressional request.Wonder about payday lenders’ treatment of consumers while the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been sidelined? Issue subpoenas. Curious how much “Big Pharma” spends on marketing versus research and skeptical of the current public facing numbers? Issue subpoenas.Want to know all the gross details of private equity’s evisceration of Toys ‘R’ Us and Sears and so many other formerly thriving employers? Issue subpoenas. Wonder what effect Blackstone is having on the housing markets or if foreclosure fraud is still ongoing? Issue subpoenas.It’s taking longer than some would like to see but Democrats are determined to do it their way.“I understand that we are probably going methodically and therefore slower than some would like and I understand the pent-up appetite to just get this done” Connolly said. “It’s sort of like Goldilocks. One’s too hot one’s too cold one’s just right. Hopefully we will arrive at that point of equilibrium where it’s just right.”Rep.

Boeing 737 Max 8 crash report: Ethiopia says pilots followed procedures - VoLog In or Sign UPreliminary report on Ethiopia crash finds pilots followed Boeing’s procedures properlThe international scandal is ongoing.Preliminary report on Ethiopia crash finds pilots followed Boeing’s procedures properlEmployees work on a Boeing 727 Max 9 plane in Renton Washington in March 2019.8 jet that crashed in March were following the procedures Boeing recommended but were still unable to stop the jet from nosediving Ethiopian investigators say.On March 10 Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa Ethiopia to Nairobi Kenya faltered and crashed soon after taking off killing all 157 people on board. The incident came just months after a Lion Air flight of the same model took off from Jakarta Indonesia and crashed killing all 189 passengers. The pair of disasters has put scrutiny on the safety of the Boeing 737 Max planes which were first introduced into service two years ago.Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges on Thursday presented a preliminary report on the crash and according to said “The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly provided by the manufacturer but was not able to control the aircraft.” The report is based on analysis from the jet’s flight data recorder and cockpit recorder and more than a dozen investigators.thanked investigators and said it will continue to work with the investigation team. It said the preliminary report “clearly showed” the pilots “have followed the Boeing recommended and FAA approved emergency procedures to handle the most difficult emergency situation created on the airplane” and that it was “very unfortunate” that they could not stop the plane from nosediving.said it would “carefully review” the report and “take any and all additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of our aircraft.”“We will carefully review the AIB’s preliminary report and will take any and all additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of our aircraft.” —Boeing Commercial Airplanes President &amp; CEO Kevin McAllister.Under scrutiny specifically is the jet’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) an anti-stall system in the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes that makes it difficult for pilots to control the plane without being overridden. It’s not known whether the MCAS or pilot error caused the crashes. The preliminary report doesn’t assign blame but it’s likely to ratchet up the pressure on Boeing and the regulators who green-lit the new model.Boeing in its statement said the preliminary report contains information “indicating the airplane had an erroneous angle of attack sensor input that activated the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) function during the flight as it had during the Lion Air 610 flight.” The company is planning to release a software update to the MCAS and pilot training.During Thursday’s news conference Moges didn’t mention the MCAS by namethe New York Times note. But after the conference she told the Times it had been active during the Ethiopian Airlines flight though she couldn’t yet say how many times it was turned on and off.She said the plane had a valid certificate of airworthiness and per NPR officials haven’t determined whether there was a structural problem with the aircraft.Boeing 737 Max 8 and 9 jetsafter the pair of crashes.On Thursday the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)it would “continue to work toward a full understanding of all aspects of this accident” and will “take appropriate action” as necessary.This is a big scandaBeyond the obvious tragedies themselves the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes have ballooned into a huge international scandal.Vox’s Matt Yglesias laid out what’s going on (you should read his full explaine) and it’s a lot more than this anti-stall system. Boeing in looking to outdo a competitor made some less-than-ideal decisions about the plane and basically used software to get around a bunch of other problems with the model. And the FAA put a lot of trust in Boeing that it was doing the right thing. Per Yglesias:The story begins nine years ago when Boeing was faced with a major threat to its bottom line spurring the airline to rush a series of kludges through the certification process — with an underresourced Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) seemingly all too eager to help an American company threatened by a foreign competitor rather than to ask tough questions about the project.The specifics of what happened in the regulatory system are still emerging (and despite executives’ assurances we don’t even really know what happened on the flights yet). But the big picture is coming into view: A major employer faced a major financial threat and short-term politics and greed won out over the integrity of the regulatory system. It’s a scandal.With Thursday’s preliminary report the scandal continues to unfold and it’s likely far from over.The news moves fast.

Chicago’s Lori Lightfoot joins a growing group of black women mayors - VoLog In or Sign ULori Lightfoot’s historic victory is part of a bigger story of black women winning in politicChicago’s mayor-elect joins a small but growing group of black women holding elected positions.Lori Lightfoot’s historic victory is part of a bigger story of black women winning in politicWith her victory on April 2 Lori Lightfoot became the first black and first openly lesbian mayor of Chicago America’s third-largest city.Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/TNS via Getty ImagChicago made history this week by electing Lori Lightfoot ablack woman who is openly lesbia as mayor. It’s the largest American city to do so. Her victory ushers in a new political era for Chicago which has been plagued by various policing controversies corruption scandals and a large economic deficit.Lightfoot’s election — and the fact that her opponent Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle was also a black woman — also highlights a much broader trend around the country: the growing number ofblack women running for political office and winninThe 56-year-old lawyer and former president of the Chicago Police Board though she was no stranger to local politics had not held political office before the election. Born in Ohio andraised in a largely segregated are Lightfoot attended the University of Chicago Law School and remained in the city after graduation serving as a federal prosecutor with the Northern Illinois US Attorney’s Office in the 1990s before working in various city departments and joining a corporate law firm.During the campaign Lightfoot argued that she was a strong police reform advocate. In 2015 outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel appointed her to lead the city’s police accountability task force which was created in the wake of the controversialpolice shooting of 17-year old Laquan McDonal and the task force quickly issued a searing report criticizing the Chicago Police Department’s treatment of people of color. Lightfoot also led the city’s police board which handles police disciplinary cases and has the power to fire officers.— joining Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza Preckwinkle and community organizer Amara Enyia — in thamid falling popularity and continued criticism of his handling of the McDonald case. A February 26 election narrowed the field to Lightfoot and Preckwinkle meaning that no matter who won the April runoff Chicagowould have its first black woman mayoLightfoot ran on a message of promoting accountability in the city positioning herself as a political outsider who wanted local government to better respond to the needs of city residents. As Lightfoot’s platform called for “increasing access to affordable housing creating an office of public safety to reduce crime and reform policing and pushing through a graduated real estate transfer tax to help combat homelessness.”In her race Lightfoot — like several candidates of color who’ve won election in recent years — didn’t back away from discussing her identity and how her experiences had shaped her political goals particularly when it came to matters of policing.The message appealed to voters in a city reeling from the ongoing fallout from the which saw city officials block the release of footage contradicting officers’ accounts for more than a year. The city also continues to face a number of crises over education funding and school closures. In recent years waves of black Chicagoans have left the city in search of better economic opportunities in surrounding suburbs and in Southern states fueling what some demographershave called a “reverse Great Migration.”In an acceptance speech Tuesday night Lightfoot acknowledged the historic nature of her win. “Today you did more than make history” she told a crowd of supporters. “You created a movement for change.” She has pledged to work with Preckwinkle as she begins her tenure as mayorjoining her at a unity prayeThe mayoral race which saw two black women compete for leadership of one of the largest cities in America was unprecedented. And the race highlights a growing number of black women candidates who are seeing success in local politics.Lightfoot joins a growing number of black women winning political officWith her victory Lightfoot joins a small but growing number of black women serving as mayors in the US. just 4 percent of mayorships in America’s 307 largest cities are currently held by black women. When she takes the oath of office in May Lightfoot will also joinSan Francisco Mayor London Breeas one of two black women mayors leading one of the 14 largest cities in America.“A few years ago in 2014 there was just one Black woman elected and serving as a Mayor of a major city” Kimberly Peeler-Allen co-founder of Higher Heights for America explained in an email to Vox. “When Lori Lightfoot is sworn into office we will have eight Black women serving in these top roles.”Just 18 black women have served as mayors of America’s 100 largest cities according tothe Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers Universit. The wave of black women seeking mayoral positions saw an uptick in 2017 when eight black women were on the ballot across the country leading some political strategists to call the year “The Year of the Black Woman MayoSome of these women were not elected but there were victories that year including in Charlotte North Carolina whereVi Lyles became the city’s first black woman mayo and New Orleans where LaToya Cantrell. That December Keisha Lance Bottoms became the second black woman towin a mayoral race in Atlantfollowing a bruising contest. One year later in 2018 Breed won the mayorship in San Francisco. When smaller cities are included in the analysis at least 10 black women (including Lightfoot) have been elected to a mayoral position since 2016.The victories have been encouraging to groups that support black politicians and political candidates especially since many of these groups have long noted that black women candidates oftenstruggle to gain institutional supporand funding in the early stages of their campaigns.“Victories for Black women in mayoral races demonstrates that these aspirants are worthy of future investment that closes the gap between Black women’s electoral potential and their electoral power” Peeler-Allen says.Black women’s electoral success isn’t just about who they are — it’s also about how they run for officIn recent years black women have also seen success in other local elections. According to the crowdsourcedBlack Women in Politics databas468 black women ran for politicaoffice in 2018 and the majority of this group competed in local races.They’ve won positions on city councils as local representatives and as district attorneys. In one particularly high-profile example a group of 19 black women dubbed the “Houston 19”all won election to judgeshipin Harris County Texas last year. but the success of black women candidates in recent years isn’t just because of who they are but how they are running for office. Many have used their campaigns to stress issues like racial justice economic development health care and gun violence focusing on issues that voters of colorAs the congressional campaign of Massachusetts’s Ayanna Pressley showed last year many women candidates of color are highlightinghow their lived experience has prepared them for political offic connecting their stories to thcommunities they are running to represent. Black women likehave also seen electoral success in predominantly white districts suggesting that women of color can be viable candidates in a variety of districts.The ability to speak to issues important to voters was crucial to Lightfoot’s campaign in Chicago where sheinvested in reforming the city’s political machine. While Lightfoot’s election as a black woman and a member of the LGBTQ community is a big deal in a city that continues to struggle with inequality and disparities between predominantly white communities and communities of color voters who backed her campaign have said that one of the biggest reasons they supported her was the fact that shewasn’t closely tied to local politicStill even with the wave of success black women candidates have seen in recent years this group holds a relatively small number of political offices in the US. At the beginning of 2018 anfrom Higher Heights and the Center for American Women and Politics found that black women held just 3.7 percent of state legislative seats 0.96 percent of statewide elected executive positions and just five mayorships in the US’s 100 largest cities.Recent elections have improved these numbers slightly but black women and women of color more broadly still hold a limited amount of elected positions and continue to face barriers to running for office. Experts focused on boosting the representation of women of color in politics hope that recent victories encourage even more women to run and that political parties and funders will do more to support them in the early stages of their campaigns.As for Lightfoot she says that while she has made history she is focused on moving Chicago forward. “This is something obviously that we’ve been talking about the historic nature of the election for some time” Lightfoot. “But I think the most historic thing was beating the old entrenched Chicago machine and getting such a resounding mandate for change.”Ilhan Omar AOC and the silencing of women of color in CongresButtigieg to Mike Pence: “Your quarrel sir is with my creator”Move back to your dying hometown.

New Mexico just decriminalized marijuana - VoLog In or Sign UNew Mexico to become 24th state to decriminalize marijuanIt’s not legalization but it’s still a big change in marijuana policy.New Mexico to become 24th state to decriminalize marijuanNew Mexico is about to become the 24th state toGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this week signed legislation that will reduce penalties for marijuana from a criminal to civil violation. A person caught with less than half an ounce of pot will face a $50 fine instead of jail or prison time; penalties for drug paraphernalia will also be reduced. The law takes effect on July 1 KRQE. Under decriminalization criminal penalties linked to marijuana are removed but civil penalties like a fine remain in place and sales remain illegal. Under legalization civil and criminal penalties for marijuana possession are removed and sales are typically allowed.Some opponents of legalization favor decriminalization as a step toward peeling back America’s harsh drug and criminal justice policies. They see “tough on crime” policies as too punitive and costly but they don’t want to resort to full legalization which they fear would make pot too accessible in the US and allow big corporations to sell and market the drug irresponsibly.The concern for legalization advocates is that decriminalization keeps the ban on selling marijuana which means users wouldn’t have a legal source for the drug and criminal organizations would therefore still have a source of revenue that they can use for violent operations around the world. The fines while less punitive than arrests or prison time can also cause problems since they’reoften applied in a racially disparate manneTen states and Washington DC have legalized marijuana although DC and Vermont don’t allow sales. Fourteen additional states now including New Mexico have only decriminalized. but the reform didn’t make it through the state’s legislature this year.that it eliminates the harms of marijuana prohibition: the hundreds of thousands of arrests around the US the racial disparities behind those arrests and the billions of dollars that flow from the black market for illicit marijuana to drug cartels that then use the money for violent operations around the world. All of this legalization advocates say will outweigh any of the potential downsides — such as increased cannabis use — that might come with legalization.that legalization will enable a huge marijuana industry that will market the drug irresponsibly. They point to America’s experiences with the alcohol and tobacco industries in particular which have built their financial empires in large part on some of the heaviest consumers of their products. This could result in far more people using pot even if it leads to negative health consequences.For now legalization is not reality in New Mexico.

FBI director: White nationalist violence is a “pervasive threat.” - VoLog In or Sign UFBI director: White nationalist violence is a “persistent pervasive threat”His views match those of experts within the Department of Justice — just not the White House.FBI director: White nationalist violence is a “persistent pervasive threat”FBI Director Christopher Wray testifies during a US House Commerce Justice Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing on the FBI’s Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2020 on Capitol Hill in Washington DC April 4 2019.off concerns about white nationalism in the United States — telling reporters on March 15 afterwhite nationalist murdered 50 people in Christchurch New Zealand that “I think it’s a small group of people that have very very serious problems I guess.”His FBI director takes the threat much more seriously.During a House Appropriations Committee hearing with FBI Director Christopher Wray on Thursday Wraythe danger of white nationalist and white nationalist extremists in America is “significant” adding that like other extremist groups they are a “persistent pervasive threat.”That answer in response to a question from Rep. Jose Serrano matches the assessment of experts both within the Department of Justice and elsewhere. So does Director Wray’s argument that domestic terrorism is largely “less structured less organized” with “more uncoordinated one-off individuals as opposed to some structured hierarchy” which Wray said “presents its own share of challenges.”As has been the case over and over again froto Christchurch “small groups of people” committed to the white nationalist cause can and have enacted horrific violence. Since 2007 the FBI reports that white nationalist and far-right violent attacksfrom roughly five incidents per year to 31 in 2017.And concerns about white nationalist violence specifically white nationalist “lone wolf”-style perpetrators like in Christchurch or the have indeed been weighing on federal officials. Asby the Center for Strategic and International Studies in a November 2018 report on far-right extremism:Today some in the Department of Justice Department of Homeland Security FBI and state and local law enforcement agencies have expressed alarm at far-right extremism. The Trump Administration’s counterterrorism strategy released in October 2018 warned that the United States faces a threat from individuals motivated by types of violent extremism other than radical Islam “such as racially motivated extremism animal rights extremism environmental extremism sovereign citizen extremism and militia extremism.” In April 2018 federal authorities charged 57 members of white supremacist organizations with drug trafficking and kidnapping. As U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions remarked following the arrest “Not only do white supremacist gangs subscribe to a repugnant hateful ideology they also engage in significant organized and violent criminal activity.” He continued that “the Department of Justice has targeted every violent criminal gang member in the United States. The quantities of drugs guns and money seized in this case are staggering.”However despite federal concerns about white nationalist extremism the federal funding to counter that extremismor in some cases has even beenNow many experts — and members of Congress — are decrying thefor efforts to counter white nationalist extremism. In ato the House Appropriations Committee sent April 1 Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) asked for increased funding to combat white nationalist groups writing “It is time to take the transnational threat of white supremacist terrorism as seriously as we’ve rightly taken the threat posed by other international terrorist organizations and to give our law enforcement and intelligence agencies the mandate and resources they need to keep us safe.”Civil rights groups and religious organizations have also beenpressing the FBI and the Department of Justicto do more to counter white nationalist extremism.Rep.

Justice Department releases report on Alabama’s violent prisons - VoLog In or Sign UJustice Department releases damning report on Alabama’s gruesome violent prisonOne week in Alabama’s prisons: stabbings beatings sexual assault and a bed set on fire.Justice Department releases damning report on Alabama’s gruesome violent prisonA guard escorts an inmate in an Alabama prison.Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty ImageFirst three people were stabbed one to death. The next day a person was beaten. The day after that brought three beatings a stabbing and a sexual assault. The next day a person’s bed was set on fire. The day after that came another sexual assault. The final day there was another beating another sexual assault and a deadly drug overdose.That was just one week in September 2017 in Alabama’s prisons according to a newby the US Department of Justice. It found that Alabama’s prisons violate inmates’ constitutional rights citing the’s prohibition on “cruel and unusual punishments.” And if anything the report’s authors cautioned the findings only give part of the picture: “[I]t is likely that many other serious incidents also occurred this week but were not reported by prisoners or staff.”The investigation into Alabama’s prisons which are under state control began near the end of President Barack Obama’s administration and continued under President Donald Trump. It involved visits to four prisons and interviews with 270-plus inmates over more than two years.The report concluded that the prison conditions create an environment in which attacks sexual abuse and drug use are rampant culminating in “a high level of violence that is too common cruel of an unusual nature and pervasive.”American prisons are in general horrible places. Just last year a bloody riot in South Carolina’s prisons. Deaths are frequently reported in prisons fromBut the Justice Department report makes the case that Alabama’s prisons are particularly bad with the facilities seeing murders and rapes at much greater frequency than others in the US.“Alabama’s prisons have the highest homicide rate in the country” the report concluded noting that the state’s prisons “have approximately eight times the 2014 national rate.” It could be worse the Justice Department cautioned finding that homicides commonly go unreported.The Justice Department said it could sue within 49 days if the state does not address issues raised in the report.“In particular we have reasonable cause to believe that Alabama routinely violates the constitutional rights of prisoners housed in Alabama’s prisons by failing to protect them from prisoner-on-prisoner violence and prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse and by failing to provide safe conditions” Justice Department officials wrote in a letter to Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey. “The violations are exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision and overcrowding.”The problems the investigators said are tied to a severe lack of staffing and resources. There simply aren’t enough guards in a system where major prisons are on average at 182 percent capacity and staffing levels can fall below 20 percent of authorized positions. And the prison infrastructure itself is often outdated and in deteriorating condition: Doors often can’t lock making it impossible to control violent situations and investigators found open sewage running through prisons.The results are horrifying. As Katie Benner and Shaila Dewanreported for the New York Time “One prisoner had been dead for so long that when he was discovered lying face down his face was flattened. Another was tied up and tortured for two days while no one noticed. Bloody inmates screamed for help from cells whose doors did not lock.”Alabama officials also don’t take rape and sexual assault seriously due to homophobia. Justice Department investigators found “a tendency to dismiss claims of sexual abuse by gay prisoners as consensual ‘homosexual activity’ without further investigation implying that a gay man cannot be raped.”Separately the Times reported the Justice Department “is still investigating excessive force and sexual abuse by prison staff members an investigation that former federal prosecutors say could lead to criminal indictments.”The state has been aware of the problems for years but it has yet to take adequate steps to address the crisis.Gov. Ivey told the Times that in the coming months her administration will work with the Justice Department “to ensure that our mutual concerns are addressed and that we remain steadfast in our commitment to public safety making certain that this Alabama problem has an Alabama solution.”That could however come down to how much pressure the Justice Department puts on the state. Under Trump the Justice Department hasfrom getting heavily involved in overseeing for example local police departments. It’s unclear if the situation in Alabama is bad enough to push a typically apathetic Trump administration to serious action.Read the Justice Department’s full report on Alabama’s prisons.Rep.

He wants to be the Democratic answer to Trump in the Midwest.Rep. Tim Ryan speaks at a news conference on auto jobs in November 2018 on Capitol Hill.Tim Ryan the Ohio congressman whoto be House minority leader in 2016 is ready to chase another of America’s top political offices: He’officially running for president in 2020. moments before he was set to appear on ABC’to make his formal announcement. Ryan outlines his decision to run for president and specifically cites theclosure of a General Motors planin Lordstown Ohio which is in the congressional district he represents.“When our local GM factory was shut down last Thanksgiving I got a call from my daughter who was consoling her friend whose father was an autoworker and was just laid off. My daughter said to me with tears in her voice ‘You have to do something’”“That’s why I am running for president” he added. “It’s time to do something.”Ryan is staking out a position as the candidate best suiteTrump in one of his key strengths in 2016. Trump spent that electiopromising to save manufacturing jobs in America’s Rust Belt and Midwest and he won states including Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan.during Trump’s presidency and now Ryan is taking aim at Trump for something the president promised would never happen under his watch: manufacturing plants in Ohio going dark and employees losing their jobs.Ryan’s message? Trump hasn’t kept his promise. But the Ohio congressman — a close ally to unions and organized labor in his district — is vowing he will.“There’s so much change — globalization automation cultural — I don’t really think either party has really wrapped their arms around all of these dynamics and put a cohesive message together” Ryan told Vox last year. “Trump obviously did it in a concise way but he hasn’t delivered on any of that stuff. He promised but he kind of got what the main problem was but no solution anywhere near helping solve those problems.”It’s time for us to get to work rebuilding the American Dream! Here’s why I’m running for President of the United States.GM’s Ohio plant closure hit close to home for Ryathat it would shutter up to five plants in the US and Canada as part of a restructuring plan to cut costs by $6 billion by 2020. One of the plants it said it would close was Lordstown — and it did just that on March 6 resulting in about 1500 workers being laid off. GM made the Chevy Cruze a small sedan there and the plant had been limping along for a while as the demand for those types of cars among American consumers has fallen.Ryan called GM’s announcement on the closure “devastating” and slammed the company. “Thousands of families have sacrificed to build GM into what it is today. And in return GM has turned its back on us when we need them the most” he said.has weighed in on the plant closurand tried to push GM to reopen it. He has prodded GM CEO Mary Barra to find a solution and tried to blame local union leaders for the closure. (Trump did not howeverfrom union leaders asking for help on the plant.)to request funding for a Department of Energy domestic manufacturing conversion grant program which provides grants and loans to car manufacturers looking to produce hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles arguing that GM’s Lordstown plant would be a “prime candidate” for the money.Thus far GM has not reversed course on the plant closure. And a month after the facility shuttered he’s announcing his presidential bid.Ryan’s platform is tailored to “the solutions that exist”“It’s time for us to start building the America we deserve” Ryan’s presidential website reads. “An America that invests in public education affordable health care and an economy that works for all of us. An America united by a shared vision for our future.”Ryan is planning to run on his experience as a Democrat who has represented a working class Ohio district since 2003. Ohio is a swing state that has seemed to trend more red in recent cycles; it went for Obama in 2008 and 2012 but went red for Trump in 2016 and showed few signs of swinging back to blue during the 2018 midterms. Ryan who says hcounts Trump supporters among those who voted for him believes he can appeal to both parties.As such his opening pitch to voters doesn’t contain calls for Medicare-for-all or tuition-free college. Instead Ryan is casting himself as someone looking for sensible solutions to the problems America faces in rising health care and education costs and saving good-paying manufacturing jobs.“As I travel through Ohio and the country I’ve been inspired by the solutions that exist” Ryan’s website reads. “On every issue from manufacturing to health care to schools and education to taking care of and healing our vets I find brilliant Americans who are innovating and creating REAL solutions.”The news moves fast.

The House passes update to Violence Against Women Act in face of NRA opposition - VoLog In or Sign UThe NRA tried to block an updated Violence Against Women Act in the House — and faileIt now faces a fight in the Senate.The NRA tried to block an updated Violence Against Women Act in the House — and faileSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi answers questions during her weekly news conference at the US Capitol March 28 2019.The House just overwhelmingly approveda reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Actthe United States’ landmark legislation funding programs meant to prevent and prosecute abuse against women. It did so in the face of staunch opposition from the which argued that a new provision in the bill barring dating partners convicted of abuse and stalking from owning firearms went too far.VAWA —which was co-authored by then-Sen. Joe Biden and— first became law in 1994 and has been reauthorized by Congresssince. When it initially passed it was the first comprehensive national law to tackle violence directed at women including domestic abuse and sexual assault.Every time VAWA has been reauthorized in the past lawmakers have sought to strengthen the law and close potential loopholes that older versions may have had. In 2013 lawmakers pushed through changes that would extend the provisions of the law tofor example. Lawmakers are seeking to do the same this time around as well — and it’s one of the main reasonsDemocrats resisted including an extensioof the legislation in an omnibus package negotiated to end the shutdown.In the latest update sponsored by Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) — the sole Republican co-sponsor — Democrats are seeking to expand several tenets like providing additional financial aid for women who’ve experienced domestic violence to stay in their homes and ramping up punishment for cyberbullying. But they also included one that’s drawn the ire of the NRA: banning all intimate partners who’ve been convicted with abuse and stalking from purchasing a firearm. (Currently this ban only applies to a person if he or she was “married to lived with or have a child with the victim”“The gun control lobby and anti-gun politicians are intentionally politicizing the Violence Against Women Act as a smokescreen to push their gun control agenda”NRA spokesperson Jennifer Baker told NPas part of an explanation for the organization’s opposition. The NRA has both urged House members to vote against the bill and said it would publish scores regarding lawmakers’ final votes on it.Democrats have resolutely stood behind this expansion and argued that closing the so-called “boyfriend loophole” is vital to ensure that the law effectively protects women. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she didn’t think the NRA’s pushback would affect the law’s chances of getting through the lower chamber.“There’s very discrete provisions that relate to protecting women’s safety. And they’re against it”Pelosi said according to Roll Cal. “I don’t see that it has much impact on the passage of the bill in the House of Representatives.”In all VAWA has provided more than $7 billion to grant programs that do everything from helping fund rape crisis centers to strengthening law enforcement resources aimed at prosecuting crimes against women since its inception. Now its reauthorization will be considered by the Senate which is working on its own version of the legislation.Republicans in the Senate could see the firearms provision as a sticking poinClosing the “boyfriend loophole” might not have stopped VAWA’s reauthorization in the House but the Republican-controlled upper chamber could be a different story.House Republicans had already expressed concerns about updates to the legislation and sought to advance their own “clean” version of the bill which would extend its funding without any add-ons. Since that effort has failed the attention turns to Republicans in the Senate who may push a similar version.“A modest extension of this law is consistent with how this matter has been handled in the past” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously said while Republicans were pushing to add a “clean” extension of the bill to the legislation reopening the government. (Democrats rejected that effort so the law’s funding actually expired on February 15 though aDemocratic aide told Roll Call at the timthat this would have little impact in the near term.)Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are working on their own bipartisan version of the reauthorization though it’s not yet clear how many of the House provisions would also be included in it.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) outlined the importance of the firearms provision in a floor speech earlier this week highlighting the devastating risks posed by a gun in instances of domestic violence:According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence on average nearly 20 people every minute 20 people every minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. That is a tragedy and a crisis. One-in-four women experience severe intimate partner physical violence and one-in-seven have been stalked by an intimate partner to the point at which she felt very fearful or believed that she or someone close to her would be harmed or killed. The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk – hear me – increases the risk of homicide by 500 percent.These risks are a major factor senators will have to consider as they weigh what their version of the bill will look like. If their take winds up being different from the House’s they will go to conference where lawmakers from both chambers will try to seek middle ground.Rep.

Yemen resolution: Congress passes historic resolution to end US support for Saudi-led war - VoLog In or Sign UCongress passes historic resolution to end US support for Saudi-led war in YemeRepublicans tried to weaponize anti-Semitism against Democrats to block the vote — and failed.Congress passes historic resolution to end US support for Saudi-led war in YemeProtesters demonstrate against the war in Yemen and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.Congress has officially passed a resolution to end US support for the war in Yemen a strong rebuke of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy toward Saudi Arabia.Trump has pledged to veto the resolution.The war in Yemen directed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (or MBS as he’s commonly referred to in Washington) has killedand left more than 20 million Yemenis in need of humanitarian assistance.The US helps the Saudi-led coalition which also includes the United Arab Emirates and several other Gulf Arab and African countries by providing them with intelligence selling them arms and ammunition and until late last year fueling warplanes.That means the US is partially culpable for the death and destruction of Saudi’s enemies in the war — the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels — and the thousands of civilians who have been killed. In one particularly egregious incident a coalition warplane bombed aschool bus full of childrelast August with an American-made bomb killing at least 40 of them.The Yemen resolution invokes theWar Powers Resolution of 197(WPR) which gives Congress the power to direct a president to remove troops involved in “hostilities” abroad if there has been no formal “declaration of war or specific statutory authorization” from Congress.Not only does it serve as a censure of Saudi’s conduct in the war it’s also a clear check on executive power; if the US wants to be involved in a war in Yemen Congress has to declare it. The Republican-led Senate passed the resolution in March and it now heads to Trump’s desk. TheWhite House says the president plans to vetNonetheless that the resolution has passed signals a significant shift in Congress around Saudi Arabia. Getting it done took intense progressive antiwar activism and a rare bipartisan coalition of progressive and conservative lawmakers to claw back war-approving authority from the president and end US participation in a war that has created one of theTrump really didn’t want this to happePresident Donald Trump holds up a chart of military hardware sales as he meets with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in the Oval Office.Progressive lawmakers including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) have been pushing to get this done for years. But the war powers resolution really caught bipartisan steam last year — closely tied to the shock and outrage over the killing of Saudi journalist dissident and American resident Jamal Khashoggi and Trump’s sympathetic response to Saudi interests.was killed and allegedly dismembered last October inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul. Lawmakers many of whom have historically backed the US-Saudi relationship are angry about the killing. In October Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) a staunch Trump ally said he feltSince then the White House top administration officials and Saudi lobbyists who are well have been working hard to build support foUS involvement in the Yemen war.In March 2018 then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattisthat stopping US support “could increase civilian casualties jeopardize cooperation with our partners on counterterrorism and reduce our influence with the Saudis — all of which would further exacerbate the situation and humanitarian crisis.” However in Octoberalso pushed for a negotiated peace deal to end the fighting — a peace deal that remains elusive.Meanwhile Trump has repeatedly emphasized his support for MBS calling him a “great ally.” In Marchreports showed that the United Stateapproved six secret authorizations to sell Saudi Arabia nuclear power technology which both Democratic and Republicans lawmakers have warned could aid a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.Republican leaders repeatedly tried to weaponize anti-Semitism to stop this votHouse and Senate Republican leaders have worked hard to protect Trump’s interests with Saudi Arabia and try to stop this war powers resolution from making its way to Trump’s desk. Last year under Paul Ryan’s leadership House Republicans blocked a vote on the resolution altogether despite similar measurepassed in the last GOP-controlled SenatWhen Democratic leaders came into control and made the Yemen resolution a priority (Majority Leader Steny Hoyer is a co-sponsor as was Nancy Pelosi last year before she was speaker) Republicans continued their campaign to stall the process by trying to weaponize anti-Semitism against Democrats.In February after Minnesota progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar’s comments about the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC and Israel-US relations which both Republican and Democratsdecried as anti-Semitic dog whistle Republicans added an amendment to the Yemen resolution condemning anti-Semitism. Democrats voted in favor of the seemingly innocuous provision.Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi speaks as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) (C) and other congressional Democrats listen.But the Republican amendment proved to be in bad faith. Because the amendment was not relevant to the core text of the resolution Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used procedural rules to block the Senate’s vote on the House version of the resolution forcing the legislative process back to square one.Seeing that the procedural gimmick worked the first time House Republicans tried it again in the final vote bringing up the same resolution to censure Omar and put Democrats in a difficult spot: To pass the final resolution Democrats first had to vote to reject adding a pro-Israel amendment against the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement — a push to boycott Israel.“They are playing games with a bill that speaks to the horrific situation in Yemen and I just don’t think you can play politics” Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) who chairs the House Rules Committee told Vox of the maneuver. “If they don’t want to support the bill that’s fine but Republicans are going to be Republicans.

Google will offer some benefits for contractors after internal protest - VoLog In or Sign UGoogle will extend some benefits to contract workers after internal protesThe sudden layoff of 34 contract programmers angered employees and contractors alike.Google will extend some benefits to contract workers after internal protesGoogle employees and contractors walk off the job to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment claims on November 1 2018 in Mountain View California.Google employees are rewriting workplace rules at one of the world’s largest tech companies.Following months of pressure from workers Google announced on Tuesday that it will start requiring contract companies to provide some benefits to the thousands of contract employees who work every day with Google’s full-time employees at company offices around the world.Google said firms that provide it with contract workers must offer them paid sick days paid parental leave comprehensive health care and tuition reimbursement according to a spokesperson for Google. These contract companies which include catering businesses and cleaning services must also agree to pay workers at least $15 an hour.This is no small thing.Temporary workers contract employees and vendors (collectively known aknown as TVCs) now make up a huge part of Google’s global workforce —. That includes everyone from cafeteria cooks to software engineers. But unlike Google’s 90000 full-time employees contractors do not get the same pay perks or benefits. Many don’t even get paid vacation.Google’s temporary workers have grown increasingly frustrated with what they view as their second-class status and last month that frustration turned to outrage. On March 8 Google managers abruptly fired 34 contract writers on its “personality team” which developed the voice of Google Assistant in more than 50 languages“We demand that Google respect and uphold our existing contracts. For those whose contract was shortened we demand payment for the remaining length of the contracts”they wrote in a lettecirculating internally which was signed by more than 900 employees and TVCs. “We also demand that Google as a whole respect the work of contractors like those on the Personality Team. Convert contract workers to full-time employees give us the benefits and stability we deserve.”Google didn’t respond to an email Wednesday from Vox about the workers’ demands but a spokesperson pointed to the new policy changes which addressed some of the points they raised.Several TVCs applauded the decision in a blog post Wednesday but said the laid-off employees are still waiting to hear back from Google about whether the company “will respect our current contracts or convert us to full time positions.”Google’s policy change is the latest victory for Google workers who are using their collective leverage to successfully change policies they consider unfair and unethical. Their sustained pressure has prompted Google to reform itsagreements and to stop pursuing contracts to develop artificial intelligence technology for the US military. And they’ve now joined contract workers in their push for equal treatment.Contract workers have accused Google of creating an unequal workforcFull-time employees at Google have encouraged temporary workers to demand equal treatment dignity and respect.In December a group of TVCssent a scathing letter to CEO Sundar Picha accusing the tech company of creating a segregated workforce in which contract workers get paid less and get far fewer benefits than full-time employees who do the same work.Because contract workers are more likely to be people of color they also say the dynamic reinforces “a system of institutional racism sexism and discrimination.”The letter which was shared with Vox was signed simply “TVCs at Google” so it’s unclear how many workers feel that way. But contractors now make up a huge part of from marketing and sales staff to computer programmers. Google has hired so many contractors in recent years that they now outnumber full-time employees (the company has aboutThe temporary workers who are employed by subcontracting firms but work in Google’s offices said they wear different-colored badges and are often shut out of meetings and denied information needed to do their jobs.“It is clear that we will continue to be mistreated and ignored if we stay silent” they wrote in the letter. “Google has the power —  and the money  — to ensure that we are treated equitably with respect and dignity.”is hardly the only US companto employ a large workforce of contractors the sheer size of the company and its temporary workforce points to a larger problematic trend within the US economy:Too many tech companies are trying to boost profit marginby hiring contractors whom they pay less and who receive fewer benefits than full-time employees on their payroll.Thousands of workers at Google don’t get paid sick days or vacatioGoogle and other Silicon Valley tech companies are well known for their generous employee perks.

But less discussed is the company’s reliance on contract workers which Bloomberg describes as a “” that does all the grunt work for less compensation. They wear red badges while full-time employees wear white badges.on the subject. But here are a few paragraphs that capture the dynamic and why employees believe it’s problematic:Before each weekly Google all-hands meeting trays of hors d’oeuvres and sometimes kegs of beer are carted into an auditorium and satellite offices around the globe for employees who wear white badges. Those without white badges are asked to return to their desks.Google’s Alphabet Inc. employs hordes of these red-badged contract workers in addition to its full-fledged staff. They serve meals and clean offices. They write code handle sales calls recruit staff screen YouTube videos test self-driving cars and even manage entire teams — a sea of skilled laborers that fuel the $795 billion company but reap few of the benefits and opportunities available to direct employees.letter contract workers expressed anger about this situation saying it creates an underclass within Google’s workforce.The perceived mistreatment of contract workers was one reason that 20000 Google employees and TVCslast month at Google offices across the world. They were also angry about a New York Timesdetailing how Google paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of sexual harassment while staying silent about the alleged misconduct.“These changes are significant and we’re inspired by the thousands of full-time employees and TVCs who came together to make this happen” the employees responded in their blog post. “However even though these changes are an important step forward toacknowledging some of the needs of TVCs in genera there’s still a long way to go.”It’s disturbingly easy to trick AI into doing something deadlHow digital technology is destroying our freedoAmazon is releasing its own AirPod look-alikeExclusive: Google cancels AI ethics board in response to outcrThe AI breakthrough that won the “Nobel Prize of computing”The absurdly high cost of insulin explaineCigna a major insurer is capping monthly insulin costs at $25.

Trump tax returns: Democrats want to know if he’s under IRS audit - VoLog In or Sign UThe intriguing reason Democrats used to demand Trump’s tax returnTrump keeps saying he’s under audit. That’s one of the things Democrats are trying to find out.The intriguing reason Democrats used to demand Trump’s tax returnPresident Donald Trump at a meting in the White House in April 2019.President Donald Trump keeps saying he can’t release hisbecause he’s under audit — but the audit is actually one of the reasonsTrump has offered multiple excuses for why he won’t release his tax returns a norm his predecessors followed for 40 years. One of the explanations he uses most often is that he’s under audit. He did it again on Wednesday after Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) who chairs the House Ways and Means Committeeput in a formal requesto the IRS asking for Trump’s tax returns for the past six years.“Until such time as I am not under audit I will not be doing that thank you” Trump said according to. He continued “We are under audit despite what people said and we are working that out.”But being under audit does not preclude Trump from releasing his tax returns — he could go ahead and release them anyway. There’s also precedent for a president releasing his tax returns while under audit —. What’s more part of what Democrats are looking to do in requesting Trump’s tax returns is find out if the IRS is properly vetting them.lays out guidance for processing the tax returns of the president and vice president and says they are subject to “mandatory examinations” by the agency. The IRS isn’t legallbound to audit the returns but is supposed to. What we don’t know is if it’s ignoring that guidance or probing the returns the sufficient amount.Neal pointed that out in histo IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Wednesday explaining that one of the purposes of his request is to conduct oversight of “the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President.”“The IRS has a policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice-presidents yet little is known about the effectiveness of the law” Neal said in aIt’s not clear whether Trump’s pre-presidential tax returns are being audited and his claims that they are could be fake. But the 2017 and 2018 returns if the IRS is following its own procedures are supposed to be audited.An IRS spokesperson didn’t return a request for comment on Neal’s request.We already kind of know what the IRS commissioner thinks about Trump’s tax returnThe IRS commissioner is a presidential appointee meaningfor the job he has right now. Part of what Democrats want to find out is whether as a political appointee he’s unbiased in doing his job.“Is the IRS capable of auditing the president is a legitimate question” Joseph Thorndike a tax historian and director of the Tax History Project told me when discussingthe process for requesting Trump’s tax returns earlier this yeaWe actually have some insight into what Rettig thinks of Trump’s tax returns including whether he should release them while under audit. The longtime tax attorney wrote forin 2016 that he wouldn’t advise Trump to release his returns.“Is there any legal impediment to Trump publicly releasing his tax returns? Absolutely not” Rettig wrote. “Would any experienced tax lawyer representing Trump in an IRS audit advise him to publicly release his tax returns during the audit? Absolutely not.”We don’t know if Trump is actually under audit — the IRS could not be reviewing his presidential tax returns and he could be lying about his pre-presidential tax returns being audited. Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen in abefore Congress in February said he didn’t believe Trump was being audited. In factthat what made Trump nervous was the idea that releasing his returns like previous candidates wouldextra scrutiny from the IRS.“What he didn’t want is to have an entire group of think tanks that are tax experts run through his tax return and start ripping it to pieces and then he’ll end up in an audit and he’ll ultimately have taxable consequences penalties and so on” Cohen said.If Trump’s returns are indeed under audit — whether those from before his term began or aftethey’re likely being probed by the IRS’s “” a specialized group that is supposed to conduct audits on very rich taxpayers which Trump claims to be. At Forbes Rettig laid out the process the Wealth Squad follows in its work meaning that theoretically if Trump’s returns are being audited he knows what to do. He also hypothesized what might be in the returns:So what is in Trump’s Returns? Likely information prepared by many very well-qualified tax professionals who were quite aware the general public might be looking at the returns at some future date. It’s unlikely an accurate overall financial picture will surface by simply reviewing his returns. He likely pays taxes at a lesser rate than many of us given the nature of his real estate and similar investments being subjected to lower tax rates than salaries earned by the rest of us. Certainly his tax professionals have not advised him to overpay his taxes.The IRS could be conducting a fair complete audit of Trump’s tax returns while he’s president before he was president or not at all. That’s part of what Democrats are trying to find out. So when the White House gives the excuse that it’s not releasing Trump’s tax returns because of the audit it might be inadvertently helping Democrats build their case.The news moves fast.

Some Mueller team members aren’t happy with Barr’s description of their findings - VoLog In or Sign USome Mueller team members aren’t happy with Barr’s description of their findingThree new reports describe behind-the-scenes dissent. Here’s what we know.Some Mueller team members aren’t happy with Barr’s description of their findingDid Attorney General Bill Barr properly represent the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation?Some members of Mueller’s team don’t think he did — and they think the findings are worse for Trump than Barr let on according to a new reports by theNicholas Fandos Michael Schmidt and Mark Mazzett came first. The sourcing for their claim was “government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations” — that is the Times did not necessarily talk to members of Mueller’s famously leak-proof team. But the reporters describe what “some” Mueller team members have “told associates.” Another interesting detail is that Mueller’s team had prepared “multiple summaries of the report” — but Barr did not use them in his letter.Washington Post’s Ellen Nakashima Carol Leonnig and Rosalind Heldermaadded more details. Evidence against President Trump on obstruction of justice “was much more acute than Barr suggested” one person who knew of the complaints said. A separate source told them that Mueller’s summaries of different sections of the report were designed for speedy public disclosure raising questions about why Barr didn’t rely on them.Ken Dilanian of NBC Newadded the detail that some on Mueller’s team have said the report paints “a picture of a campaign whose members were was manipulated by a sophisticated Russian intelligence operation.”This reporting poses two major questions. First how widespread is this feeling of frustration among special counsel team members? The Times saying it included “19 lawyers about 40 F.B.I. agents and other personnel.” But the paper is vague about how many people have complained just saying “some” did. In any case the fact that these complaints have spilled out to three different news outlets within 24 hours certainly suggests serious dissent.Second what do these Mueller team members think Barr failed to convey? The attorney general wrote in a letter to Congress that the special counsel did not “establish” a conspiracy between Trump associates and the Russian government to interfere with the election and that he declined to render a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction of justice. Is either of these or both misleading? Or did Barr leave out other important points?Drama over the Mueller reporThe Times piece was the first to suggest some behind-the-scenes drama and dissent about Barr’s handling of Mueller’s report.On Friday March 22 the Justice Department announced that Mueller had concluded his investigation and submitted this report to the attorney general. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein reviewed it that weekend and on March 24 Barrto Congress to advise them on Mueller’s “principal conclusions.”First Barr said Mueller’s investigation found that though the Russian government tried to interfere with the 2016 election the special counsel “did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia” in these efforts.Second Barr said Mueller probed the question of whether President Trump tried to obstruct justice in interfering with the Russia investigation — but “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.” Barr went on to say though that upon his own review (conducted with Rosenstein) Mueller’s evidence “is not sufficient to establish” that Trump obstructed justice.Trump soon put his own gloss on these findings: “No Collusion No Obstruction Complete and Total EXONERATION.” (Barr’s summary in fact quoted Mueller saying he wasexonerating Trump on obstruction of justice.)No Collusion No Obstruction Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)And though some instantly accepted Barr’s findings others were suspicious about whether there was more to the story. And these new reports suggest there may well be.We may know more soon enough. Last Friday Barr said he was on track to release the report to Congress and the public with redactions of certain categories of information byThat wasn’t enough to mollify House Democrats who areto try and get Mueller’s full report.

Biden allegations: a reminder of what women deal with every day - VoLog In or Sign UThe Biden allegations are a reminder of the small invasions women deal with every daThese moments all add up to hold women back.The Biden allegations are a reminder of the small invasions women deal with every daFormer US Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the University of Pennsylvania’s Irvine Auditorium on February 19 2019 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.“Affectionate” is the word people keep using.Former vice president and presumptive presidential candidate“is extremely affectionate extremely flirtatious in a completely safe way”“It would be really unfortunate if we got rid of everybody who was just an affectionate kind of person” saidBiden himself said in a statement that while he has “offered countless handshakes hugs expressions of affection support and comfort” over the years he never believed he was acting inappropriately. In aissued on Wednesday he pledged to “be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future” while also saying “I’ve always tried to make a human connection.”But there’s something crucial missing from the narrative that Biden is just an affectionate guy. The behaviors of which he’s been accused  —rubbing noses with another woma and a variety ofcaptured on camera over the years — don’t constitute sexual assault and some say they were not sexual in intent. But such behavior can still have a pernicious effect on women a constant low-level distraction that can hold women back in their work and in their lives.“It does matter and it does affect us” said Lucy Flores wholast week that Biden kissed her on the back of the head at a campaign event in 2014 told Vox. “You’re constantly navigating and changing your own behavior in order to avoid those kinds of situations.”tape was released in 2016 showing Donald Trump bragging about his ability to grab women “by the pussy”Amanda Taub of the New York Timewrote about sexual harassment and assault as a kind of tax on women — something that costs us time energy and money as we’re forced to choose between defending our bodily autonomy and keeping peace with the men upon whom our careers often depend.The idea applies here too:A kiss on the head may not seem severe especially as thehas revealed countless reports of violent sexual assault. But such kisses add little by little to the tax that women pay for existing in American society.“If you’re spending time and energy and emotion working to avoid a harasser or a specific environment you’re not going to be putting that time toward your career” Amy Blackstone a sociology professor at the University of Maine who has studied the effects of harassment told Vox.So when we evaluate allegations like the ones against Biden it’s not enough to ask whether the behavior involved was criminal or whether it was meant in a sexual way. We should also be asking whether it contributed to an environment that is still even in the #MeToo era dragging women down.Defenders of Biden say he had good intentions. But effects matter too.Stories — and photos and video — of Biden being “handsy” have been around for years as. But his reputation for excessive touching started to get more attention on Friday after Flores a former Nevada state lawmaker wrote that in 2014 then-Vice President Biden came up behind her smelled her hair and planted a kiss on the back of her head.The incident happened Flores writes as she was about to take the stage at a rally where she’d be campaigning for lieutenant governor of Nevada. Afterward “I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me” she wrote. “My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.”Amy Lappos told the Hartford Couranthat Biden had grabbed her by the head and rubbed noses with her in 2009. “It wasn’t sexual” she said. However she told the paper “There’s a line of respect. Crossing that line is not grandfatherly. It’s not cultural. It’s not affection. It’s sexism or misogyny.”Many defenses of Biden have centered on the claim that he never intended to make sexual advances toward women. “I am sure that somebody can misconstrue something he’s done”. “But as much as I can know what’s in anyone’s heart I don’t think there is bad intent on his part at all.”Biden himself said in a statement that “not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.”And for some that’s enough. “Biden’s saying I didn’t intend to make anyone uncomfortable but I’ll listen &amp; learn”tweeted NBC News analyst Mimi Roca. “If respectful statements like that aren’t welcomed we’re just encouraging the Trump double down &amp; smear approach.”On Wednesday Biden added that “social norms have begun to change” and that he would be more mindful of his actions in the future. “But I’ll always believe governing quite frankly — life for that matter — is about connecting with people.”Social norms are changing. I understand that and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it.Flores told Vox she was disappointed by Biden’s statement on Wednesday. “Cultural norms are not changing” she said. “This type of behavior has always been inappropriate. We have just now reached a tipping point where women are feeling like enough is enough.”In the statement Biden makes the case that his physical conduct — he describes touches on the shoulder and hugs — has always been about bonding with people. But regardless of his intent the effects of behavior matter. And the effects of Biden’s conduct according to Flores were real.“Even if his behavior wasn’t violent or sexual it was demeaning and disrespectful” Flores wrote. “I wasn’t attending the rally as his mentee or even his friend; I was there as the most qualified person for the job.”Biden she said “made me feel uneasy gross and confused.”And then she had to take the stage and campaign. It was a moment when she no doubt had to bring all her skills to bear to make the best possible case before voters. And in that moment she says Biden failed to treat her as the qualified candidate she was.“I am a professional” Flores told Vox. To have a man “treat you as if you are just this frail woman who needs support that in and of itself is degrading.”Women are frequently assumed to be unqualified for their jobs andforced to prove their expertisagain and again — Biden in Flores’s account was behaving in a way that played into those assumptions.Imagine if before she took the stage Biden had shaken her hand and offered her words of encouragement — if she’d been able to approach voters feeling supported by the vice president rather than having to shake off feelings of discomfort at a crucial moment in her political career.Flores was able to move past the incident in the moment she told Vox: “You move forward and you put it out of your mind and you process it later.” And maybe nothing about Flores’s race which she eventually lost would have been different if Biden had behaved differently. The effect of an individual small moment like the one Flores describes is hard to measure. But the fact that women have to deal with moments like that constantly and men rarely do perpetuates inequality.Invasions of women’s personal space add up over time. And they hold women back.“The burden of avoiding and enduring sexual harassment and assault results over time in lost opportunities and less favorable outcomes for girls and women” Taub wrote at the Times in 2016. “It is effectively a sort of gender-specific tax that many women have no choice but to pay.”Sometimes the tax is obvious like when a woman has to leave her job — or her entire field — to get away from a harassing boss.that sexual harassment in science and engineering contributes to women’s decision to leave those fields Elise Gould a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute who has studied the gender pay gap told Vox. And overall women who are harassed are 6.5 times more likely to leave their jobs than women who don’t experience harassment according to aco-authored by Blackstone the sociologist.Leaving a job due to harassment can affect women’s earning prospects. In Blackstone’s study the women who were harassed were significantly more likely to report financial stress two years after their harassment than women who were not harassed.But sometimes the tax accrues more subtly and slowly in little moments that pop up again and again throughout a woman’s life.“Whereas men can freely seize an opportunity women must pause and weigh the costs” Taub added asking themselves questions like “Is it worth accepting a professor’s offer for one-on-one research mentorship on the assumption that his interest in me is strictly academic?”Asking oneself those questions takes time and mental energy that could be spent on other tasks — tasks men get to perform uninhibited. The constant need to worry about misconduct from men can result in opportunities turned down or simply a feeling of exhaustion and self-doubt that can keep a woman from doing her best work.“If you’re all of a sudden put on a project with someone you feel threatened by” Gould said “that’s going to affect your ability to be most productive or to be present.”Women make about 81 percenof what men make in America today — black Latina and Native American women make significantly less than that. As Taub notes women are less likely than men to make partner at a law firm or to get tenure at a university. And although womenwon more seats in Congress than evein 2018 they still make upHow much of that is due to the constant drag on women’s progress caused by men’s invasions of their physical space?

Pete Buttigieg’s plan to make governing great again - VoDemocratic presidential hopeful and South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks to reporters before appearing at the Commonwealth Club of California in San Francisco on March 28 2019.After Obama Democrats need a new theory of change. Pete Buttigieg thinks he’s got it.The most important debate in the Democratic primary is over how to make governing great again.After Obama Democrats need a new theory of change. Pete Buttigieg thinks he’s got it.It seems very weird that the mayor of South Bend Indiana isUntil you talk to Pete Buttigieg. Then it doesn’t seem so weird.I sat down with Buttigieg for and came away unexpectedly impressed. A lot has been made of the eight languages Buttigieg speaks and his stint as a Rhodes scholar and Navy intelligence officer but what struck me most is that Buttigieg has a coherent theory of what’s gone wrong in American politics and what’s required to fix it. That’s rarer among presidential candidates than you might think.I think about often. In it he argued that the contest between Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and John Edwards was “not a primary about ideological differences or electability but rather one about a difference in candidates’ implicit assumptions about the current circumstance and how the levers of power can be used to get the country back on track.” It was he said the “theory of change primary.”Obama won that primary and in the short period in which Democrats had 60 votes in the Senate he managed to push through quite a bit of legislation. But while Democrats broadly revere Obama there’s a consensus that his theory of change ultimately crashed on the shoals of Republican obstruction. As a result many of the problems Obama sought and failed to address — from inequality to climate change to wage stagnation to money in politics to gerrymandering — have worsened and Democrats see President Trump as the poisoned fruit of those failures.Pete Buttigieg talks with a reporter at his office in South Bend Indiana on January 10 2019.The central lesson of Obama’s presidency Buttigieg argues is that “any decisions that are based on an assumption of good faith by Republicans in the Senate will be defeated.” The hope that you can pass laws through bipartisan compromise is dead. And that means governance is consistently reliably failing to solve people’s problems which is in turn radicalizing them against government itself.“You can only go so long with this divergence that we have between the center of the American people and the center of the American Congress” Buttigieg says. “Donald Trump was not exactly a corrective but he was a consequence of the fact that people watched their government drifting further and further away from them in terms of what it would deliver.”Buttigieg’s response — one that you also hear from 2020 hopefuls Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Gov. Jay Inslee — is to restructure government so that popular majorities translate more cleanly into governing majorities. He’s discussed eliminating the Electoral College scrapping the filibuster and remaking the Supreme Court so each party nominates the same number of justices and vacancies become less “apocalyptic.”There’s nothing new about a Democratic candidate promising to fix the system. Obama ran on similar themes in 2008. House Democrats opened their session by passingof good-government reforms. But once Democrats take power concrete policy change with the immediate benefits it promises tends to win out over the abstractions of procedural reform. It’s easier to run for reelection bragging about a tax cut than about weakening the Electoral College.President Barack Obama prepares for Congress to vote on a $789 billion economic stimulus package on February 13 2009.Obama’s presidency in this respect was typical. Once he was elected — and understandably given the economic freefall — fixing the system took a back seat to moving legislation through the system. Obama stabilized the financial sector and expanded health insurance to tens of millions of people but he left the corrupting influence money plays in our politics untouched.What surprised me while talking to Buttigieg was his insistence that he would prioritize political reforms over policy wins. “This is the difference between somebody who’s thinking about 2024 versus somebody who’s thinking about 2054” he says. “To me yes it’s worth it because we’re talking about setting the terms of the debate as they will play out for the rest of my life.”Democrats need to debate their theories of changeSo far the 2020 Democratic primary has been fought through ambitious policy promises primarily around health care. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris believe in creating a universal Medicare program and abolishing private insurance. Sen. Cory Booker and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke believe in creating a universally accessible Medicare program and keeping private insurance.Selcuk Acar/NurPhoto via Getty ImagePaul Ratje/AFP via Getty ImageSen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke all seen launching their bids for the 2020 presidential race.These differences seem vast and ideologically they are. But what do they amount to when translated into practical politics? Democrats aren’t going to have 60 votes in the Senate and you can’t abolish private insurance with 51 votes or even passThe key question here isn’t what the president believes but how the Senate works. If Democrats don’t remove the filibuster their only chance to pass major legislation is the filibuster-proof. The main constraint on reconciliation is that each provision has tin nature and reforming the health care system on that scale requires a vast quantity ofchanges. No one really knows what the Senate parliamentarian will and won’t allow but experts I’ve spoken to believe both bills would be disqualified dozens of times over.“My sense has been that provisions that look like regulations — such as lowering the age to 55 for buying into Medicare — tend to be viewed as such by the parliamentarian meaning that they would require 60 votes” says political scientist Sarah Binder an expert in congressional procedure.The challenge the filibuster poses to the progressive agenda — or really any agenda — is just one way the differences between the candidates’ theories of political change matter as much as or more than the differences in their policies. But the candidates rarely debate these questions openly in part because we have almost no vocabulary for describing that dimension of politics.The words we use to describe the ideologies of presidential candidates are imperfect but at least they exist. There are liberals neoliberals democratic socialists leftists conservatives neoconservatives centrists paleoconservatives libertarians and New Democrats to name just a few. The boundaries among these groups can be fuzzy but overall it’s a pretty flexible vocabulary for describing what this or that politician believes.There’s no similarly accepted shorthand for the difference between candidates like Warren and Buttigieg and Inslee who envision sweeping reforms to the way laws are made and people like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar who emphasize that their relationships with Republicans better equip them to maximize change in the system we have. Nor are their categories clearly describing the approaches the candidates intend to take toward electing allies or mobilizing public opinion or much discussion of whether they’d prioritize expanding the earned income tax credit over curbing money in politics.Too often we assume policy ambition corresponds with political style but that shortcut often misleads us. Sanders for instance has proposed raising tens of trillions in taxes to build a European-style welfare state in America. But asked whether he’d eliminate the filibuster he pronounced himself “not crazy” about the idea. And he’s not alone. Sens.have offered outright defenses of the filibuster and Harris has. As far as I can tell the only senator running for president who seems to be seriously considering eliminating the rule isSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) launched her presidential bid outside of her home in Cambridge Massachusetts on December 31 2018.By contrast among others running for president the filibuster isn’t nearly as revered. Along with Buttigieghave both discussed scrapping the practice (as it should be noted hasSimilarly Republicans leveraged their obstruction of the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court and the advantage they hold in the Electoral College to maintain generational control of the Court. There’s been some talk in Democratic circles aboutin response. Buttigieg has embraced an interesting idea (first proposed inby Daniel Epps and Ganesh Sitaraman) by which Democrats and Republicans would get to name five justices each and then those justices would jointly name another five members to the Court. Harris Warren Gillibrand and Inslee have been open to the idea of adding justices though they’ve shied away from offering specific plans.But Sanders has thrown cold water on such proposals. “My worry is that the next time the Republicans are in power they’ll do the same thing” he said. That’s a reasonable view — arguably it’s the most reasonable view — but conservative control of the Supreme Court endangers Sanders’s broader agenda. What’s his plan for that?Democrats who want to reform the political system have a long list of policies to choose from. Granting statehood and political representation to the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico makes moral sense and could well tip the balance of power in the Senate where Democrats currently operate at a large geographic disadvantage. Eliminating the Electoral College commands virtually unanimous support in the field though no one has a viable plan for how to do it. Campaign finance reform is both popular and long overdue. The Washington Post has a usefulof where the various candidates stand on some of these issues.But these ideas require the power to implement them and Democrats currently lack even that. What are the candidates’ theories of party building such that they’re likelier to have the congressional allies necessary to make these kinds of changes? How would they approach governing if Republicans hold the Senate as is the likeliest 2020 outcome?We are better at discussing what candidates want to do than how they will do it. That hole in our political vocabulary matters as it makes it hard to debate the core question of any political campaign: How will the candidates actually make real people’s lives better?Towards the end of our conversation I asked Buttigieg for his vision of America’s national identity. “The only semi-convincing justification for American exceptionalism” he replied “is this idea that America represents a way of governing a way of doing things that makes us all better off.”It wasn’t the answer I expected but it frames the challenge for Buttigieg and the rest of the Democrats well: How does the party that believes in government make governing great again?Pete Buttigieg answers questions during a gathering in Raymond New Hampshire on February 16 2019.Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaigButtigieg to Mike Pence: “Your quarrel sir is with my creator”After Obama Democrats need a new theory of change.

Trump tax returns: Key Democrat officially demands them - VoLog In or Sign UA key House Democrat just officially demanded Trump’s tax returnRep. Richard Neal invoked his authority to request the returns from the IRS.A key House Democrat just officially demanded Trump’s tax returnThe congressional Democrat who has the power to get President Donald Trump’s tax returns has made his move.On Wednesday Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee sent a letter to the IRS commissioner demanding Trump’s federal income tax returns for the past six tax years.asks for the 2013-2018 federal income tax returns for the president himself and for eight entities connected to Trump (including the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and seven Trump business entities). He also demands information about any audits connected to these returns and administrative files for them.“Congress as a co-equal branch of government has a duty to conduct oversight of departments and officials” Neal said. He framed his request not as about scrutinizing Trump’s own history but about evaluating an IRS policy to audit all presidents’ tax returns.Neal wants the returns by April 10 — Wednesday of next week. But this is likely only the start of a lengthy legal battle.Trump’s tax returns: the backgrounFor decades every major party presidential nominee publicly released their tax returns in a gesture that wasn’t legally required but was a nod to transparency. Such disclosures could reveal more about how politicians have made their money whom they might owe money to or whether they were in fact appropriately paying their taxes.Very quickly Trump — a wealthy businessman with a complex opaque financial situation — was asked whether he would follow these past candidates’ example. He said he would. In February 2015 while Trump was considering running hetold conservative radio host Hugh Hewitthat if he ran “I would release tax returns.” Then after getting in the race Trumpin August 2015 “at some point I’ll release it.”As the first primaries and caucuses approached the following Januaryagain that such a release was coming soon. “We’re working on that now. I have big returns as you know and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we’ll be working that over in the next period of time.”But in February 2016 Trump’s line suddenly changed. The problem he said was that he was currently being audited by the IRS. Because of that he said he wouldn’t release his returns until whenever the audit was finished. (Sometimes Trump would go further and say that the audit meant he “can’t” release his returnsTax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit no problem!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Many immediately suspected the audit excuse was somewhat less than sincere. Perhaps the best evidence this is the case is that more than three years have passed since then and Trump still hasn’t released his returns.Indeed after he won the presidency Trump shifted to arguing that he shouldn’t have to release his returns because he uh won the presidency.I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)New York Times wrote a lengthy reporon Trump’s history of participating in “suspect tax schemes” including “instances of outright fraud.” But the paper relied mainly on returns from the 1990s — those from more recent years remained elusive. And congressional Republicans — who had control of the House and Senate for Trump’s first two years in office — weren’t particularly eager to learn more.An obscure law lets the Ways and Means committee chair request anyone’s tax returnBut the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in last year’s midterms finally provided an opportunity for Trump’s returns to be brought to light.A law passed in 1924 gives the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee the power to request any individual’s tax returns from the Treasury Department for review in closed session. Here’s the key part ofStarting this January that chair was Rep. Richard Neal. Democrats had campaigned on — among other things — holding Trump and his administration accountable on a number of issues but have been somewhat slow to confront the administration. This week however Neal finally invoked his authority to demand six years’ worth of returns from Trump Trump’s trust and “seven other core Trump business entities that control scores of other Trump operations” (per the New York TimeDon’t expect the returns to be handed over quickly — Neal himself has said he expects a court battle over this matter. And even if the Treasury Department does provide Neal with the returns there’s another catch — they’re supposed to be reviewed only in “closed executive session” so it’s unclear how they’d be able to be made public.But Neal’s request is the first major step in this process.

"Trump’s fear-stoking immigration policy in two White House retweets  - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s fear-stoking immigration policy in two White House retweetsThe retweets are bad. They also reflect a broader problem with Trump’s reasoning.Trump’s fear-stoking immigration policy in two White House retweetsThe White House retweeted crime stories from a CBS affiliate in Nashville about crimes allegedly committed by undocumented immigrants.Instead of posting content aimed at lifting Americans up or even just highlighting events involving public officials the Trump administration is now using the official White House Twitter account to sensationalize immigrant crime.They’re doing so at a time when President Donald Trump isthreatening to close the US-Mexico borde— even as he acknowledges that doing so would be bad news for the American economy — and two days ahead of a trip to the border in which Trump is expected to celebrate the construction of new fencing.Voters repudiated Trump’s fear-mongering about immigrants during last November’s midterm elections but even with Democrats now controlling the House Trump hasn’t given up on trying to convince Americans that undocumented immigration is a national emergency. During an Oval Office event on Tuesday Trump urged Congress to pass legislation curtailing both legal and illegal immigration going as far as saying “we have to get rid of judges” who preside over immigration hearings in order to allow for expedited deportations.Then on Wednesday the White House retweeted crime stories from a CBS affiliate in Nashville about crimes allegedly committed by undocumented immigrants.It’s unusual for the White House to retweet random crime stories and there appears to be no reason to share these two with the account’s 18.3 million followers beyond trying to demonize undocumented immigrants as criminals.Later Wednesday afternoon the White House account tweeted out a crime story and framed it as evidence that “sanctuary cities” are unsafe. (Afound an inverse relationship between immigration and crime at a neighborhood level.)Jersey City designated itself as a sanctuary city in February 2017.— The White House (@WhiteHouse)To be clear nobody argues that undocumented immigrants are perfect angels. Criminals will be found among any large group of people. But from a rational standpoint there is no reason to be particularly afraid of immigrant crime. study after study indicates that immigrants — documented or otherwise — commit crimes at lesser rates than native-born Americans. But instead of engaging with that reality the Trump administration obfuscates the issue by highlighting out-of-context raw crime numbers and sensationalizing specific criminal acts — even if they’re only figments of Trump’s imagination as seems to be the case with tales of kidnapping he regularly tells during his speeches.Trump offers disturbing evidence-free descriptions of kidnapping &amp; sex trafficking.""You have 3 women tied up in the backseat of a car you're not going through folks a port of entry where they do look in the backseat at least right?""These retweets are symptomatic of a broader problem with Trump’s reasoninTrump’s irrationality when it comes to crime has a flip side. While the president has been quick to politicize acts of violence committed by immigrants or Muslims he has consistently downplayed the problem posed by white nationalism despite a wealth of studies showing that right-wing extremism is aAfter a white nationalist who praised Trump as “a symbol of renewed white identity and common purpose” murdered 50 people at two mosques in New Zealand last month Trump responded to it by downplaying violent white nationalismit’s just “a small group of people that have very very serious problems.” On the other hand the president seems to regard individual crimes as evidence that immigrants in general are dangerous.In that way the White House’s decision to sensationalize immigrant crime reflects a broader shortcoming with Trump’s reasoning. For example though science indicates global warming is occurring Trumptouts cold snaps as evidence the science is wrondata indicates immigration is a net positiv Trump touts individual crime stories as evidence that curtailing immigration would be a good thing.The news moves fast.

Elizabeth Warren 2020: Warren wants to jail CEOs for corporate misconduct - VoLog In or Sign UElizabeth Warren wants CEOs to go to jail when their companies behave badlWarren introduced a new bills to hold executives more accountable for corporate misconduct.Elizabeth Warren wants CEOs to go to jail when their companies behave badlSen. Elizabeth Warren at the “We the People” summit in Washington DC in April 2019.Just one big bank executivwent to jail after the 2008 financial crisis. The CEO ofand his successor walked away from the megabank withafter it was discovered employees had created. The same goes for theEquifax CEO after its data breacwants that to change. Instead of these executives slinking away after the companies they run get caught behaving badly — or sticking around without consequences — she wants them to go to jail.The Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential contender on Wednesday rolled outthe Corporate Executive Accountability Acthat would up the accountability of corporate leaders for their firms’ misdeeds whether or not they personally approved of the actions that broke the law. The bill builds on existing laws to include negligent executives of corporations with more than $1 billion in revenue and says that if they or the companies they run engage in bad behavior they go to jail for a year.the Ending Too Big to Jail Ac which Warren introduced in 2018 and is reintroducing again this Congress. That proposal would require the CEOs of big banks to certify that nothing illegal is happening under their watch and create a permanent governmental investigative unit to look into financial crimes.“They presumably will make it easier for prosecutors to hold bankers and other corporate executives who are guilty of misconduct to account in the courts” Bart Naylor a financial policy advocate at the watchdog group Public Citizen which is backing both bills told me.on Tuesday evening Warren laid out the case for her legislation. “If top executives knew they would be hauled out in handcuffs for failing to reasonably oversee the companies they run they would have a real incentive to better monitor their operations and snuff out any wrongdoing before it got out of hand” she wrote.It’s been 10 years since the financial crash cost millions of people their homes jobs and savings. But not one big bank CEO has gone to jail. It’s time to reform our laws to make sure that corporate executives face jail time for overseeing massive scams.Warren 69 is outpacing her fellow 2020 Democratic rivals when it comes to major policy rollouts so far this election cycle. And a lot of her proposals are aimed squarely at corporate America and moneyed interests whether that means breaking upoverhauling American capitalism and corporate governancShe has for years railed against the banking industry and corporate interests and originally conceived of the Dodd-Frank financial reform. As a candidate for the White Houseshe makes Wall Street nervouThe Corporate Executive Accountability Act briefly explaineThe new legislation Warren introduced would basically make it easier to hold corporate executives accountable for their companies’ wrongdoing. Typically it’s been hard to prove a case against individual executives for turning a blind eye toward risky or questionable activity because prosecutors have to prove intent — basically that they meant to do it.This legislation would change that Heather Slavkin Corzo a senior fellow at the progressive nonprofit Americans for Financial Reform told me. “It’s easier to show a lack of due care than it is to show the mental state of the individual at the time the action was committed” she said.A summary of the legislation released by Warren’s office explains that it would “expand criminal liability to negligent executives of corporations with over $1 billion annual revenue” who:- Are found guilty plead guilty or enter into a deferred or non-prosecution agreement for any crime.- Are found liable or enter a settlement with any state or Federal regulator for the violation of any civil law if that violation affects the health safety finances or personal data of 1% of the American population or 1% of the population of any state.- Are found liable or guilty of a second civil or criminal violation for a different activity while operating under a civil or criminal judgment of any court a deferred prosecution or nonprosecution agreement or settlement with any state or Federal agency.Executives found guilty of these violations could get up to a year in jail. And a second violation could mean up to three years.This doesn’t mean executives could be jailed for anything that goes on in their companies — there has to be a real case to be made that they were negligent or basically should have known about what was going on. But in the example of Wells Fargo for example legislation like this being in place could have made a difference. The company had an incentive system that drove workers to create millions of fake accounts andignored warnings about the matte“We’ve just seen case after case where basically the corporation and the shareholders got penalized and admitted wrongdoing but there is no personal accountability for executives” Marcus Stanley the policy director at Americans for Financial Reform said.This builds on Warren’s previous legislatioThe Corporate Executive Accountability Act builds on the Ending Too Big to Jail Act which Warren also introduced.That bill requires executives of banks with more than $10 billion in assets to certify each year that they’ve conducted due diligence and found no criminal conduct or fraud at the institutions they oversee. That would perhaps make it easier for prosecutors to go after such executives if wrongdoing is discovered because if executives are certifying that all their ducks are in a row but it turns out they’re not it will be easier to hold them responsible.It would also create a permanent agency that would investigate criminal activity in all national financial institutions. It would essentially be an expansion of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program () created after the crisis to ensure financial institutions that got money from the government used it properly. SIGTARPin punishing financial industry bad actors after the crisis but its scope is limited and Warren’s bill would expand it.Brandon Garrett a law professor at Duke University told me he thinks the Ending Too Big to Jail Act might be the more powerful of Warren’s two proposed bills because enforcers often lack the resources to thoroughly investigate complex corporate and executive conduct and this would address that.“Especially with all of the turmoil at the Department of Justice you just have a lack of enforcement capabilities” he said. Garrett has found that corporate prosecutions and corporate enforcement at the federal level have declined under President Donald Trump’s administration. He told me that generally in about only one-third of cases where public companies enter a plea agreement or deferred prosecution agreements are convicted or admit there was a crime people associated with the case are prosecuted.Pieces of legislation like these would be tough to sell among moderate Democrats not to mention Republicans. Democrats would have to take back the Senate in 2020 and probably abolish the filibuster to get something like this passed and even then there are no guarantees.Moreover past administrations have also promised to get tough on financial crimes and corporate America only to soften up once they’re in control. Of course Warren has bet much of her career on railing against corporations and banks so this could be different.Corporate America gets caught behaving badly … a loIn the wake of the financial crisis many Americans were outraged at what they perceived as banks getting off easy. Just one major bankerKareem Serageldin of Credit SuissAnd since then many actors within the financial industry have kept behaving badly. Wells Fargo has been the subject of a cascade of scandals;Equifax saw a huge data breach and kept it under wraps for weekIt’s not just the banking and finance industry.Facebook has undergone scandal after scandal since its inceptio ranging from data privacy breaches to disinformation campaigns and beyond. The companies in the pharmaceutical industry that have perpetuated the opioid crisis and the executives who oversaw themhave barely suffered consequences eitheFor a lot of companies especially the big ones breaking the law or acting unethically is just the cost of doing business. Maybe they’ll get a fine and a slap on the wrist but as long as they’re making enough money it’s worth it.Warren’s legislation seeks to curb that behavior and she’s betting that if there’s a personal threat of going to jail executives may think twice. The experts I spoke with said they also hope legislation like this would embolden more prosecutors to take up cases in the first place.“Corporations do not act on their own accord” Slavkin Corzo said. “So if a corporation was engaged in criminal activity then clearly there were individuals within the corporation who made those decisions and those individuals should be held accountable.”The news moves fast.

Forced arbitration bill: Democrats and Republicans discuss arbitration  - VoLog In or Sign UDemocrats want to ban mandatory arbitration at work. Senate Republicans are listening.A wonky legal issue is gaining (some) bipartisan support.Democrats want to ban mandatory arbitration at work. Senate Republicans are listening.A job seeker fills out an application at a job fair in Gary Indiana on June 13 2018.Kyle Telechan/Post Tribune/TNS via Getty ImageIt’s starting to look like Republicans and Democrats in Congress may actually reach a deal on something.Not on health care or immigration or any other topic dominating the headlines but a deal on a wonky legal loophole that bars millions of Americans from getting their day in court.Senate Republicans held a committee hearing Tuesday on corporate America’s alarming use of a common business practice that requires workers and customers to waive their right to sue the company. Millions of Americans have unknowingly signed or accepted these contract clauses in which they agree to take legal disputes to private arbitration — a secretive legal forum with no judge no jury and practically zero government oversight.In private arbitration workers aretheir cases and when they do win they tend to getthan they would in court.Consumer advocates and labor groups have long opposed forced arbitration but the #MeToo era has pushed this semi-obscure (though widespread) legal practice into the national spotlightin keeping sexual harassment complaints and illegal business practices hidden from the public for decades.And while Democrats in Congress have introduced a slew of bills to ban or limit arbitration clauses Republicans have stayed mostly silent. But there now appears to be some bipartisan agreement on the issue. Several Republican senators are showing new concern about the arbitration system and seem willing to work with Democrats to fix it.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) the chair of the House Judiciary Committee is one of those arbitration skeptics. He said he scheduled Tuesday’s committee hearing on the topic to discuss the benefits and drawback of this private legal forum so senators can ““I believe arbitration has a place in society. I want to be pro-business but everything that’s good for business may not be the best answer for society”during his opening remarks. “In 2019 I want to look long and hard on how the system works; are there any changes we can make?”A few Republican senators on the committee who are also lawyers shared similar concerns suggesting thamay be one of the rare issues in Congress that could lead to a bipartisan compromise.Millions of workers can’t sue their employers and they probably don’t know iworkers have given up their right to go to court just to earn a paycheck.That’s because these employees signed mandatory arbitration agreements which are often buried in a stack of hiring documents that managers require new employees to sign. They usually have a legalese-laden name such as “Alternative Dispute Resolution Agreement.”Chances are if you’re reading this article and you work for a private company you signed one too. About half of non-unionized workers at US companies are subject to these agreements —the share in the early 2000s. America’s most well-known companies including Walmart Starbucks Macy’s Uber and McDonald’s now require some or all of their workers to sign them.The rise of mandatory arbitration has made it nearly impossible for workers to seek legal justice for wage theft overtime violations and job discrimination. This secretive system also has the potential to hamper theWomen are coming forward often for the first time with stories of widespread sexual harassment at work only to discover that they’ve been shut out of the court system because they signed an arbitration agreement. The practice is particularly harmful to women and black employees as they aremore likely to be subjected to arbitration agreementbecause they make up a large share of workers in the industries that require arbitration the most:“What’s really happening is that our judicial system is getting privatized” David Gottlieb an employment attorney in New York who often represents workers in arbitration told me last year. “It’s being privatized in a way that really only favors one side the employer.”But it’s not just hospitals and universities that have gone this route. Silicon Valleyare also fans of mandatory arbitration clauses. And in the wake of a 2017Supreme Court ruling that allows employers to prohibit class-action claimfrom workers in arbitration companies have even more incentive to add arbitration clauses to their employment contracts.The negative impact of this trend on workers and consumers was all too clear at Tuesday’s Senate hearing.Witnesses described frustrations with the arbitration systeThe guests invited to testify at Tuesday’s Senate hearing on arbitration included the usual suspects: lawyers aligned with big businesses an academic expert and consumer rights advocates. But the inclusion of two unexpected witnesses — a US Navy reservist and a restaurant owner — signals that GOP leaders want to show the impact of arbitration on two of their traditional constituencies: military service members and small business owners.Kevin Ziober the Navy reservisthe had “no choice” but to sign an arbitration agreement when managers at a California company presented one to him after he was hired in 2010. Ziober didn’t want to lose his jobhe said during the hearin so he signed it. Then in 2012 the company fired him the day after he deployed to serve 12 months as a reservist in Afghanistan. He tried to file a lawsuit against the company for violating a federal law that requires employers to hold a job for reservists who are deployed. But because he had signed an arbitration clause a federal judge ruled that he would have to resolve his complaint in private arbitration.In taking his case to arbitration Ziober said he felt completely disempowered:I would have no access to a federal judge nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate I would lose my Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial I would lose any meaningful right to an appeal and I would lose my right to a public proceeding of any kind. Along with other servicemembers I have fought to advance American ideals and values abroad so it was particularly disheartening to lose these fundamental rights at home.After hearing his testimony Sen. Joni Ernst a Republican from Iowa seemed sympathetic.“I am very sorry to hear about what happened to you. You went to serve our country and our country didn’t protect you” who served in the Army National Guard. “If you had been allowed to litigate your claim in federal court do you believe you would have been better protected?”Ziober said that at the very least public access to the court system would have allowed his case to raise awareness about the pitfalls of arbitration clauses.“My voice will basically be silenced”. “ Service members who could benefit from this will never learn from it.”Alan Carlson a restaurant owner in Oakland California told lawmakers he was “shocked” to find out that he had signed an arbitration agreement in his contract with American Express. The point of the contract was to let customers pay for their meals with the popular credit card and American Express would charge the restaurant a small fee for each transaction. Carlson said he grew frustrated with American Express and tried to sue the company for its strict rules on business owners. But a lawyer told him it was not worth the cost to challenge a giant company like American Express.“This cost-prohibitive system means that there is no way one small business can get justice done” he saiduring the hearing. “I believe this is un-American.”No Republicans on the committee questioned Carlson and some GOP lawmakers insisted that the benefits of arbitration outweighed the costs. They said the private legal forum is necessary for businesses to quickly resolve legal disputes which saves them money and therefore saves their customers money too.So it’s not like Republicans are ready to rip up arbitration clauses. But big banks and other corporations are still worried. Even a few Senate Republicans who oppose forced arbitration could be enough to ban the practice.The renewed focus on arbitration is making big business uncomfortablTo understand how significant it is that Senate Republicans held a hearing on mandatory arbitration all you really need to know is this: The last time the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed the legislation to regulate arbitration was in 2013 when Democrats controlled the Senate.With Republicans in charge few have shown any interest in overhauling the arbitration system. That likely has a lot to do with the fact that the GOP is closely aligned with business interests and rarely opposes anything the US Chamber of Commerce supports. And the chamber really really likes arbitration.The influential business group had lobbied Congress in 2017 to oppose an Obama-era arbitration rule at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which would have prohibited companies from banning class-action lawsuits in consumer arbitration clauses.The Senate held a vote that year to overturn the arbitration rule but it barely passed with a 51-to-50 vote. Graham and Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) were the only two Republicans who voted against scrapping the rule and Vice President Mike Pence ended up casting the tie-breaking vote. In November President Donald Trumpand the rule was revoked.On Tuesday a lawyer for the US Chamber of Commerce and an attorney who crafts arbitration clauses for Wall Street banks made the expected argument that arbitration benefits consumers workers and businesses because the process is faster and less expensive than going to court.Alan Kaplinsky a consumer financial services attorneywho played a central rolin the rise of mandatory arbitration warned senators Tuesday that it could cost companiesevery five years if they can’t use private arbitration to resolve legal disputes with consumers.“Somebody has to bear that cost. Does it all get passed on to the shareholders? Probably not. Does it get passed on in the form of higher prices for everybody or just some segments of the market or segments of the market that are more risky to credit default?”. “Somebody ends up having to bear that cost; you don’t get a free lunch.”It’s true that arbitration is faster and less expensive than going to court and that some workers and consumers may prefer it. But Kaplinsky and others obscure the fact that no one is trying to outlaw the practice altogether.Democrats in Congress want to make arbitration optional not something forced upon consumers and workers. For example if an employee believes a company owes her money she can decide to take their claim to court or in arbitration.In October 2017 then-Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) introducedthe Mandatory Arbitration Transparency Ac which prohibits businesses from including a confidentiality clause in their arbitration agreements related to discrimination claims. That December a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced theEnding Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Ac which exempts sexual harassment cases from required arbitration.Then in March 2018 Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and a group of Senate Democratsan even better idea: Don’t let businesses force employees and consumers to take their claims to arbitration. Their bill the would let workers and consumers decide where to pursue their legal claims.The bill didn’t get support from Republicans but the chance of passing the bill got a lot better after Democrats regained control of the House in January. They reintroduced the bill in February which is now called Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act. It has broad Democratic support wit172 co-sponsors in the Housand 34 in the Senate. But so far Republicans have not signed on.The fact that Lindsey Graham organized a committee hearing on the topic is promising and opens the door to possible negotiation. Graham didn’t say what policy changes he would support but said he was determined to “find a solution.”Ziober the Navy reservist who testified on Tuesday appealed to that sense of bipartisanship.“Though I have been a registered Republican for the vast majority of my life I want to see our elected leaders find common ground to protect the rights that make our lives better —like consumer protection civil rights and veterans’ rights” he said.Barcelona’s remarkable history of rebirth and transformatioCars dominate cities today.

Nuclear option: Senate Republicans are changing the rules to confirm Trump’s judges even faster - VoLog In or Sign USenate Republicans have officially gone “nuclear” in order to confirm more Trump judgeIt’s a win for Republicans in the short term but Democrats could also capitalize on the change in the future.Senate Republicans have officially gone “nuclear” in order to confirm more Trump judgeSenate Majority leader Mitch McConnell at a news briefing at the US Capitol on March 26 2019.Once more they’ve changed Senate rules so they can confirm President Donald Trump’s nominees more expeditiously — a string of actions first kicked off by Democratic leader Harry Reid in 2013. It marks the third time in less than a decade that the Senate majority has used the so-called “nuclear option” — a term used for parliamentary procedure that sets a new precedent with only a simple majority of lawmaker votes.This time Republicans have amended Senate rules in order to further limit the amount of time lower-level nominees could be debated on the floor. Previously if lawmakers voted to limit debate on a nominee that back-and-forth would still be able to continue for 30 hours. Practically speaking because there is only so much time the Senate is in session this meant that there were a finite number of nominees that Republicans could get through — and that’s something they wanted to change.Republicans argued that this rules change is necessary because Democrats have gone out of their way to slow-walk consideration of Trump’s nominees. Democrats meanwhile say that Republicans have gutted other processes like “blue slips” that would enable them to otherwise vocalize their concern with different nominees.“Senate Democrats spent the first two years of the Trump administration dragging out the confirmation process to not only deny the president his team but also to waste hours of floor time that should have been spent focusing on the American people’s priorities” Republican Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) said in a statement. “This has been nothing more than obstruction for the sake of obstruction and it is outrageous.”That assertion however is laughable to many Democrats who have noted that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s supposed outrage over the way Democrats have blocked Republican nominees is hypocritical given the lengths he went to in order to prevent President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland from even getting considered for a Supreme Court seat.refused to give a hearing to Merrick Garland Pres. Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. And he wasn’t the only nominee they blocked.Now the same Republicans want to change Senate rules to speed confirmation of Pres. Trump’s nominees?Since Republicans would have needed Democratic support to make this rule change — proposed via a resolution from Blunt and Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) —  there had been some talk of a compromise that could include the reinstatement of “blue slips.” Such talks had faltered however. That left Republicans who have a 53-person majority in the Senate several votes short of the 60-vote threshold they needed to hit in order to end debate about the rules.After the procedural vote on the resolution failed on Tuesday Republicans opted to use the “nuclear option” — a last-ditch parliamentary loophole that allows them to reconsider the vote — to push through their plans anyway.By going this procedural route Republicans have established a new precedent with just 51 votes. Because this new precedent is not quite as dramatic as the elimination of the filibuster for judicial nominees Fox News’s Chad Pergram has referred to it as aDemocrats are outraged at this move not just for its departure from procedure: They argue that it could give Republicans even more leeway to rush through hundreds of nominees in the near term after they jammed through appeals court judges at a breakneck pace in 2018.One potential upside for Democrats down the line however? They would also be able to use these rules changes in order to shepherd through their nominees if the party were to retake the Senate majority in 2020 or later.How the rules change will worAs the rules stand Trump nominees undergoing Senate confirmation typically receive two votes if they are contentious. The first vote is a procedural vote to limit debate on their nomination and the second vote is to officially confirm them.In cases when a nominee is not controversial large groups of them can also be confirmed en masse if Senators unanimously agree to it.Any member of the Senate can oppose the consideration of a nominee and argue for debate to continue in perpetuity however. That tees up the first procedural vote known as a “cloture” vote which is aimed at limiting this debate so that the upper chamber can actually vote on a nomination. If the Senate votes in favor of the first procedural vote further debate on the nominee was previously curbed at 30 hours.As former Harry Reid staffer Adam Jentleson noted in a piece for forcing the use of this procedural vote is one of the few tactics Democrats still have to delay the confirmations on Trump nominees. If they employed it nominees could take up to four days to get approved under the previous rules.used this tactic more frequentlin the Trump administration than many previous ones simply because other means to oppose different nominees have been eroded. Previously lawmakers could useto indicate that they weren’t pleased with a particular judicial nominee from their home state but Republican Judiciary Committee chairs have not enforced the use of this option. Under prior procedure if a blue slip was withheld by a home state Senator that judicial nominee would typically be removed from consideration.Republicans aren’t pleased with the confirmation delays these procedural votes and subsequent debate have caused and that’s exactly what this rules change seeks to address.“President Bush Clinton and Obama had a total of 24 cloture votes filed in all three administrations in those first two years; 128 cloture votes have been required by Democrats in this Congress” Blunt said during a press briefing earlier this year. “It is clearly an attempt just to use up time.”Following Wednesday’s vote the debate on nominees is now limited to two hours rather than 30. It’s a change that had also previously been made to Senate procedure in 2013 as a temporary standing order but Blunt and Lankford’s resolution makes it permanent.The rules update cuts the time needed to confirm nominees by about a day meaning the Republican majority can now potentially push through more nominees.The rules change could end up coming back to haunt the GOWhile Republicans are seeking to capitalize on this rules change for the duration of Trump’s first term Democrats could well take advantage of it if they regain the majority in 2020 or another cycle in the future. Like any rules change the majority has made in the Senate before it’s something the minority could also utilize if they flip the chamber.Republicans were able to build upon thechanges then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid initiated for cabinet nomineeand filibuster rules during the Obama administration for example and Democrats could certainly do the same with this update. Additionally they could even go further and abolish the 60-vote filibuster threshold entirely says former Reid staffer Jim Manley.“The real question is whether this process of turning the Senate into the House ends with this latest change by McConnell or whether it makes it easier for him or the next leader — Democrat or Republican — to make the next move and do away with the filibuster once and for all” he told Vox.That’s something Senate Democrats — including a number of those running for president in 2020 — have expressed openness toward. (Not everyone is on the same page:While Elizabeth Warren has said she’s been down to keep all options on the table Cory Booker has staunchly opposed this route.)As Republicans have said Democrats have actually been supportive of this specific rules change in the past. Reid led a similar rules change which garnered 78 votes in the Senate in order to move nominations along. At the time the tweak was simply temporary.As Manley notes the change could be yet the latest one on a slippery slope that gives Democrats and Republicans more justification to mess with Senate rules in the future. Although Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has thus farshut down talk of changing the filibuste it’s a position that’s gaining increasing popularity as part of the 2020 presidential race.Wednesday’s rules change seemingly leaves the door a bit more open to a move like that.Rep.

2020 election: Joe Biden responds to allegations of touching - VoLog In or Sign UBiden responds to allegations of touching: I’ll respect people’s “personal space”The former vice president says his past behavior has been about “connecting” with people.Biden responds to allegations of touching: I’ll respect people’s “personal space”Former US Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the University of Pennsylvania’s Irvine Auditorium February 19 2019 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania.Former Vice President Joe Bide— who is expected to announce a 2020 presidential bid soon — says he’s ready to respect people’s “personal space” after new attention came toallegations he had acted inappropriately with wome“I shake hands I hug people I grab men and women by the shoulders and say ‘You can do this.’ Whether they are women men young old it’s the way I’ve always been. It’s the way I show I care about them that I listen” he said. “Social norms have begun to change they’ve shifted. And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying I understand it. And I’ll be much more mindful. That’s my responsibility and I’ll meet it.”Biden offered no direct apology for his past actions but said he would be mindful of changing norms around physical contact.Social norms are changing. I understand that and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it.Biden’s statement seemed to suggest that he intended to adjust the way he behaved moving forward but did very little to acknowledge any specific experiences of the women who have come forward.In an essay published inNew York magazine’s The Cut last wee former Nevada lawmaker Lucy Flores said Biden had come up behind her smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head making her feel uncomfortable in the process. Former congressional staffer Amy Lappos toldthat Biden had rubbed her nose with his nose at a fundraiser. On Tuesday two additional womentold the New York Timethat he had touched them in way that made them “uncomfortable”: College student Caitlyn Caruso said he had put his hand on her thigh while D.J. Hill said he had moved his hand from her shoulder to her back.Biden addressed the allegations in very broad strokes.He noted that there were “gestures of support and encouragement that I’ve made to women and some men and I’ve made them uncomfortable” but chalked up the behavior to his desire to connect with people while governing.“I’ve never thought of politics as cold and antiseptic. I’ve always thought about it as connecting with people. Shaking hands hands on the shoulder a hug. Encouragement” he said.Biden also suggested that his career working on policy to advance gender equity — including the Violence Against Women Act — served as a testament to how committed he was to changing his behavior.“I’ve worked my whole life to empower women my whole life to prevent abuse. The idea that I can’t adjust to the fact that personal space is important ... is just not thinkable.”Rep.

Pete Buttigieg is pro-Israel when Democrats are increasingly critical - VoLog In or Sign UDemocrats are increasingly critical of Israel. Not Pete Buttigieg.Buttigieg’s staunch support of Israel bucks the Democratic party’s trend.Democrats are increasingly critical of Israel. Not Pete Buttigieg.Democratic presidential hopeful South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks at the Commonwealth Club of California on March 28 2019 in San Francisco California.may be a rising star in the 2020 Democratic field but his strong pro-Israel views may put him at odds with the increasingly pro-Palestinian left flank in his own party.The 37-year-old openly gay mayor of South Bend Indiana has in the past described Israel as afor the US in how to deal with security threats. He’smost of the suffering in Gaza on Hamas the Palestinian Islamist political organization and militant group that has run the territory since 2007. And he’s stronglycondemnations of Israel — and US support for it — made by progressive lawmakers.That’s not to say he’s completely ignored the plight of Palestinians — he hasn’t. During a March campaign stop in Buttigieg said he wants America to help make “a world where Israelis and Palestinians are able to live in peace side by side.” Overall though Buttigieg has shown a willingness to back Israel.That puts him in stark contrast with the more progressive wing of his own party.has shown that liberal Democratic primary voters are less sympathetic to Israel than they were in years past. It also shows he disagrees with some first-term Representatives particularly Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).Several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination most notably Sen. Bernie Sanders are also far more critical of Israel than Buttigieg.has repeatedly condemned Israel for violence at its border with Gaza where time and time again Israeli forces have killed mostly unarmed protesters — including women and children — pleading for an end to the decade-long Israeliblockade of food fuel and medicinA senior foreign policy adviser for Buttigieg told me that “Pete doesn’t see the Israel-Palestinian issue as a zero-sum game” and while he doesn’t support the politics of far-right Israli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he still supports Israel and views it as an ally and democratic state.Still the mayor may enjoy surprising support now but it’s possible his Israel views will doom him among Democrats in the end.Buttigieg continues to make many pro-Israel statementThe former Navy intelligence officer has spoken about Israel openly for at least a year.Last May Buttigieg took a trip to Israel with other mayors that was organized by the a global Jewish advocacy organization. Shortly after his return Buttigieg was interviewed for the. That was tough timing as just four days earlierIsraeli forces had killed dozens of Palestinians protestinthe opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem.Still Buttigieg had nothing but high praise for Israel suggesting its way of handling security threats could be a good model for the US.South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg Democratic presidential candidate on Temple Mount near the Dome of Rock Mosque alongside Columbus Ohio Mayor Andy Ginther now former West Palm Beach Florida Mayor Jeri Muoio and Dayton Ohio Mayor Nan Whaley on May 10 2018.Courtesy of the American Jewish Committee.“Seeing the way that a country can be on the one hand very intentional very serious and very effective when it comes to security and on the other hand not allowing concerns about security to dominate your consciousness” he “I think that’s a very important lesson that hopefully Americans can look to when we think about how to navigate a world that unfortunately has become smaller and more dangerous for all of us.”Buttigieg’s foreign policy adviser though told me the mayor’s “comments were by no means any endorsement of Netanyahu’s policies.”Buttigieg also said many of the problems facing Gaza were Hamas’ fault.“There really is not a unified or single voice for the Palestinian people”said. “Most people aren’t aware of the difference between what’s happening in Gaza — run by Hamas in a way that is contributing to a lot of misery there — but also totally different than an environment where you’d have a negotiating partner across the table.”There’s no doubt that Hamas has failed to govern the territory well to the point thatPalestinians living there are protesting the grou. But much of theis undoubtedly also caused by Israel’s blockade.And the more recent statements he’s made on the topic of Israel suggest his views remain largely the same as they were in that May interview.During a January 31 appearance on for instance he was asked to respond to comments made by(D-MN) where she criticized Israel for violating human rights and even compared its conduct to Iran’s.Buttigieg a married gay man countered strongly. “People like me get strung up in Iran” he said “so the idea that what’s going on is equivalent is just wrong.”He continued: “They’ve [Israel] also got to figure out — and we’ve got to figure out with them as an ally — what the regional security picture is going to look like there” he said. He added that an Israeli general during his May 2018 trip told his delegation the most complicated problem facing Israel is Iran.“It’s always been one of the most fiendishly complicated issues and simple answers will not serve us well at a time like this” he said.Multiple opportunities multiple defenses of Israel. It’s pretty clear then where Buttigieg stands. The problem for him is that he increasingly stands alone.The Democrats are sparring over their views on IsraeProgressive Democrats are much less shy about voicing criticisms of Israel and championing pro-Palestinian views.Sanders a top contender for the Democratic nomination has consistently backed Palestinians in Gaza over Netanyahu’s government.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks during the “We the People” summit featuring 2020 presidential candidates at the Warner Theatre on April 1 2019 in Washington DC.pointed out in February “He’s produced videos that call Gaza an ‘’ he’s depicted Benjamin Netanyahu as part of the ‘growing worldwide movement toward authoritarianis’ and most controversially of all he’scutting US military aid to Israel.”also put pressure on Democratic candidates to skip an annual conference organized last month by a pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Surprisingly Buttigieg along with many other Democratic hopefuls didn’t go (And while not in the presidential race Muslim lawmakers likecontinue to speak out against Israel’s treatment of Palestinians — which of course has resulted in blowback on them and Democrats more generally.There’s a reason Democratic candidates are having an easier time either ignoring or outright criticizing Israel these days. A 2018showed that only 27 percent of Democrats said they sympathized with Israel an 11-point drop from 2001. Meanwhile Republican sympathy jumped 29 points to 79 percent in the same time frame.to incorrectly label Democrats anti-Israel and even anti-Jewish.Israel then will continue to be a sore spot for the Democratic party and arguably the most important foreign policy issue of the primaries. Buttigieg has already made his pro-Israel case. The question is if voters will reward him for it.Pete Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaigButtigieg to Mike Pence: “Your quarrel sir is with my creator”Democrats are increasingly critical of Israel.

2020 election: Senate Democrats want to abolish the Electoral College - VoLog In or Sign USenate Democrats introduce a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral CollegRepublicans say such efforts will hurt rural voters.Senate Democrats introduce a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral CollegA person experiments with an electoral map displayed at aFull Frontal With Samantha Bepress junket on September 5 2018.Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images for TurneA number of Senate Democrats are ready to follow through on an idea that some 2020 candidates — and a good chunk of Americans — support: abolishing the Electoral College.This week Sens. Brian Schatz Dick Durbin Dianne Feinstein and Kirsten Gillibrand introduced athat would abolish the Electoral College a position that’s become increasingly popular among 2020 candidates as the election gets underway. The ratification of the amendment would mean presidential candidates would be directly elected by the national popular vote. Separately Sen. Jeff Merkley has also introduceda package of election reform including a bill aimed at getting rid of the Electoral College.It’s a push lawmakers say they’re launching in order ensure that every person’s vote is valued equally something that’s not entirely guaranteed with the Electoral College system under which votes in certain swing states can play a larger role in deciding the outcome than others.“The status quo is quite undemocratic and radical” Schatz told Vox. “This change in my view is an unassailably logical evolution of our Constitution.”While the support for getting rid of the Electoral College has grown — more than 60 percent of voters in a pollright after the 2016 election favored using the popular vote instead — the process to ultimately do so faces a steep fight.In order to be adopted a constitutional amendment requires the support of two-thirds of the House and the Senate as well as ratification from three-fourths of states (that’s 38 states.) It could also be proposed via a constitutional convention which would require the convening of two-thirds of state legislatures along with a favorable vote for the amendment from three-fourths of them.Schatz acknowledged as much and noted that it wasn’t an effort he was expecting to come to fruition in the near term. “I don’t underestimate the difficulty here” he said.No Republican senators have signed on to the measure so far and several have already vocalized their opposition to it. They argue that a switch to a popular vote system could potentially disadvantage rural parts of the country which would receive less attention from candidates compared to more populous areas.Aside from the adoption of a constitutional amendment another possible avenue for reform is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact an agreement that requires individual states’ approval. If a state agrees to the compact it effectively guarantees that the state’s electoral votes would go to the winner of the national popular vote but only if enough states sign onThe compact requires a critical mass to work: States making up at least 270 electoral votes — the number a candidate requires to win the presidency — would need to participate in order to make it happen. So far13 states and the District of Columbi which comprise 184 electoral votes total have made the compact law.Both efforts aren’t expected to see results for some time but Schatz and the amendment’s backers say the current push is a necessary one that could translate into key changes down the line.“I believe that if and when we make this change it will seem ridiculous that we did it any other way” he said.Why Electoral College angst is cropping up agaiAs the 2020 Democratic primary gets underway a newly energized progressive wing is pushing candidates to champion not just individual policies but wholesale institutional reforms a wave that stems from concerns that the ways current systems are set up — from the courts to the Senate — simply aren’t equitable.As Vox’s Ella Nilsen reporte Sen. Elizabeth Warren recently revived the conversation about eliminating the electoral college during a CNN town hall when she was asked about expanding voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.“We need to make sure that every vote counts” she said. “The way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College and everybody ... I think everybody ought to have to come and ask for your vote.”Warren also noted that presidential candidates often concentrate their campaigning in states that are considered battlegrounds while skipping out on places (big or small) like California and Mississippi because they were likely to pick a Democrat or Republican.“There’s a broad recognition that the systems we have right now need to be modified in order to ensure that the average American citizen maintains a voice in the process” Schatz said. “There’s a thirst for systemic reforms and a desire to look at our processes that I haven’t seen in a long time.”At its core lawmakers argue that the Electoral College fundamentally places a different weight on each person’s vote depending on where they live.after the 2016 presidential election the “Democratic and Republican parties have each developed solid bases in a series of states that are all but certain to vote for them in a presidential year.” And with those Electoral College votes locked up each candidate instead gives an outsize focus to swing states like Florida Michigan Pennsylvania and Ohio:The swing states’ dominance is a consequence of the fact that almost every state chooses to allot all its electoral votes to whoever comes in first place statewide regardless of his or her margin of victory.That is it doesn’t matter whether [Hillary] Clinton wins New York by a 30 percent margin or a 10 percent margin since she’ll get the same amount of electoral votes either way. But the difference between winning Florida by 0.1 percent and losing it by 0.1 percent is crucial since 29 electoral votes could flip.Naturally then when the general election comes around candidates ignore every noncompetitive state — meaning the vast majority of the country — and pour their resources into the few that tend to swing back and forth between Republicans and Democrats. That’s the best strategy for reaching that magic number 270.The flaws of this arrangement have been thrown into sharp relief by recent elections in 2016 and 2000 when Hillary Clinton and Al Gore both won the popular vote but lost the election. All told only five times in US history has a presidential candidate won the popular vote while losing the Electoral College — an argument in the system’s favor according to its defenders. But two of those times were in the past two decades drawing lawmakers’ (and voters’) attention to the issue.The biggest pushback from Republicans centers on concerns that it could disadvantage rural voterDefenders of the current system argue that removing the Electoral College would give populous urban centers disproportionate power to decide elections compared to more rural areas (even though some analyses show there’s little incentive for candidates to pay extra attention to many rural states now).In the wake of Warren’s town hall Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) pushed back on the idea of eliminating the Electoral College arguing that Democrats only wanted to do so because they wanted “rural America to go away politically.”The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) emphasized similar concerns in a statement following this week’s introduction of the constitutional amendment. “Abolishing the Electoral College would be bad news for Iowa and for the Midwest generally” he said in a statement. “The voices of farmers factory workers and so many others in rural America would be drowned out by city dwellers on the coasts.”Schatz emphasized that these concerns were unfounded given the distribution of votes.As laid out by a nonprofit advocating for a national popular vot candidates would still have to campaign in a broad array of places if they wanted to secure a majority in a popular vote system. “The imaginary situation where a political candidate goes to Los Angeles and Chicago and just camps out is belied by the arithmetic” Schatz said.As the system stands candidates are incentivized to disproportionately spend their time in a very specific set of states in a way that doesn’t necessarily guarantee rural areas any more representationPenn State associate professor Robert Speel noted in a 2016 Time articlData from the 2016 campaigindicate that 53 percent of campaign events for [Donald] Trump Hillary Clinton Mike Pence and Tim Kaine in the two months before the November election were in only four states: Florida Pennsylvania North Carolina and Ohio. During that time 87 percent of campaign visits by the four candidates were in 12 battleground states and none of the four candidates ever went to 27 states which includes almost all of rural America.A national popular vote system wouldn’tthe votes of people who live in rural states and small towns. What is true is that it would accurately value them by treating them equal to people who live in cities. And for that reason abolishing the Electoral Collegerequire “many small states to approve a change that would reduce their influence on the presidential outcome.”That means even as the conversation about changing the Electoral College is once more picking up it’s likely this fight will go on for years. Schatz said he was seeking bipartisan backing for the measure as he and others continued to advocate for it.“The change from the United States senators appointed by the legislature to by the popular vote took decades. Women’s suffrage took decades” he said. “This isn’t necessarily a 2020 issue.”Rep.

Affordable Care Act: House Democrats just passed a resolution condemning Trump’s attacks on Obamacare - VoLog In or Sign UHouse Democrats just passed a resolution condemning Trump’s attacks on ObamacarDespite what Trump says Democrats want to show voters they’re the “party of health care.”House Democrats just passed a resolution condemning Trump’s attacks on ObamacarRep. Colin Allred (D-TX) speaks during news conference at the Capitol in January. Allred is the main sponsor of a resolution to protect the Affordable Care Act.Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty ImageHouse Democrats are continuing to hammer President Donald Trump on health care the issue that helped sweep them into power in 2018.his vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act before the 2020 elections House Democrats redoubled their efforts to protect it from another opassed a resolution on Tuesday that condemns Trump for supporting a lawsuit that would invalidate the federal health care law. The final vote was 240-186.The resolution introduced by first-term Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX) is a largely symbolic move that is likely to go nowhere in the Republican-led Senate. But it does exactly what Democrats want: It helps reinforce their message that despite what Trump says their party is the “party of health care.”“Americans are facing higher health care costs than ever but this administration’s lawsuit would drive up prices and put coverage out of reach for thousands of Texas families” Allred said.Trump’s Department of Justice recently thrust health care back into the forefront of the political debate when the department wrote inthat it supports a recent district court decision that invalidated all of Obamacare.It was the administration’s most full-throated statement so far on eliminating the signature domestic policy achievement of Trump’s predecessor. AsSo it is now the official position of President Trump’s administration that all of the ACA — the private insurance markets that cover 15 million Americans the Medicaid expansion that covers another 15 million and the protections for people with preexisting conditions and other regulations — should be nullified.Trump’s problem is the Affordable Care Act is and Republican attempts to repeal or sabotage the law have not been. Democrats want to prioritize strengthening the law as a key part of their agenda this year. In other words Democrats are delighted Trump wants to fight them on health care.House Democrats’ agenda on health care briefly explaineDemocrats rode a blue wave toin 2018 at least in paremphasizing a consistent message on health car. And since they took office in January the subject has kept them very busy.A number of contenders seeking the Democratic nomination for president in 2020 have come out in favor of— thrusting ambitious ideas about expanding health care access into the national conversation. While Housleadership has given its blessing to committee hearings on those progressive proposals strengthening Obamacaris clearly a much bigger priority for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.the particulars of how the recently introduced House bill to strengthen the ACA works:It expands the tax credits available under the law both reducing costs for lower-income families and expanding eligibility so middle-class Americans can receive federal assistance.It creates a national reinsurance program to offset high medical bills for insurers and thereby keep premium increases in check.It rolls back Trump actions expanding skimpier health insurance plans giving states the freedom to undermine the law’s benefits requirements and cutting enrollment outreach funding.Democrats know any bill they write to try to strengthen the ACA likely won’t get much play in the Senate where Republicans joined Trump in an effort to repeal the health care law in 2017. (That attempwas ultimately defeated by Republicans who defected including Sens. Susan Collins (ME) Lisa Murkowski (AK) and John McCain (AZ) but the balance of power in the upper chamber has shifted even more in the GOP’s favor since then.)But Democrats in the House are pushing this bill both show the American people they are following through on their campaign promises and to demonstrate what they would do if they took back control of the Senate and the White House in 2020.Democrats are delighted Trump wants to pivot to health carEven as the Trump administration ramps up its rhetoric at coming up with a new plan to replace the health care law Senate Republicans are showing reluctance to comply especially a21 of them start to eye reelectioTrump to walk back his plan for the Republican Party to “soon become the party of health care.” On Monday he said in a string of tweets that he would be putting off any effort to repeal and replace the ACA until after the 2020 elections.“Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate &amp; win back the House” Trump tweeted. “It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America.”On Sunday Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney said on ABC’sthat no American would lose their health insurance if Republicans repealed the ACA and replaced it with their own plan. nonpartisan analysis of the administration’s actual plan laid out in its proposed budget shows that’s not true. In its budget proposal the administration said it supports “enactment of legislation modeled after” the 2017 Republican health care bill known as Graham-Cassid— which would “cause millions to lose coverage”:Graham-Cassidy shortly after its introduction. Their report estimates that the legislation would over a decade spend $230 billion less on health coverage programs than the Affordable Care Act.That sharp cut in funding helps explain why CBO thinks that Graham-Cassidy won’deliver on Mulvaney’s promise that Americans won’t lose coverage if Obamacare is repealed.Instead the nonpartisan agency determined that “if this legislation was enacted millions of additional people would be uninsured compared with CBO’s baseline projections.” The increase in uninsured would largely come from rolling back the Medicaid expansion. That program which covers 61 million Americans and has grown significantly under the Affordable Care Act would face a $1 trillion budget cut over the course of a decade.Democrats are planning to remind American voters of these statistics all the way up until Election Day 2020.Rep.

Paid family leave: there’s a bipartisan push brewing in the Senate - VoLog In or Sign UThere’s a bipartisan push around paid family leave brewing in the SenatRepublicans keep proposing federal paid family leave bills no one likes. Now Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Bill Cassidy want to find a compromise.There’s a bipartisan push around paid family leave brewing in the SenatSupporters watch as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks on his paid family leave initiative.Republicans have spent two years trying to deliver on Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to give working parents paid maternity leave. Democrats have a few different policy proposals on the table but Republicans keep coming up with the same unpopular idea: give Americans the option to cut into their Social Security benefits early to pay for family leave.But on Wednesday Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy (LA) announced he is working with newly elected Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (AZ) to lead the Senate’s first bipartisan push to address family leave. It’s something they hope the president will sign onto but it’s not yet clear what this proposal will look like or how it would be paid for. (Cassidy didn’t give a timeline.) It does however signal a significant shift in a conversation around federal paid family that has been stuck at the ideological poles of both parties.The United States is the only industrialized nation in the world without a federal paid family leave program. As is onlyof workers get paid leave from their employers — a statistic that shrinks dramatically for low-income workers just 6 percent of whom have access to paid family leave benefits. Some states have been trying to address this on their own. This year Washington state residents began paying into a comprehensive paid family and medical leave program that waspassed on a bipartisan basi. New York New Jersey California Rhode Island and the District of Columbia also have implemented programs.“What started as something that is extremely bold has really become more mainstream and the only people who don’t know it are the people in Congress” said Vicki Shabo a paid family leave expert with New America a liberal-leaning think tank.That Republicans in Congress are seriously talking about family leave really comes down to Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump who herself said she is trying to buck the “GOP orthodoxy” around family leave. But so far the results have stuck to party lines.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) reintroduced a bill last week — theEconomic Security for New ParentAct — which would allow parents to access their Social Security benefits early for at least two months of leave in turn delaying their benefits by three to six months when they retire. The bill is very similar to another proposal by Sens. Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) — which again would force families to trade retirement benefits for family leave. Both proposals are limited to child care rather than a more comprehensive approach addressing medical leave or elder care.It might be a while until we see the Cassidy-Sinema proposal. But the fact that they’re working together shows Congress is taking on a more serious effort to address family leave in a divided Washington.Republicans have been putting forward “budget neutral” family leave plans that even conservatives don’t likSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and White House adviser Ivanka Trump present Republican proposals around family leave.Republicans are talking about paid family leave.“This is not just a family issue or a women’s issue it’s an economic issue that affects the country as a whole” Aparna Mathur an economic policy expert with the conservative American Enterprise Institute said Wednesday explaining how a policy long associated with left-leaning orthodoxy is now making its way across the aisle. In 2016 Trump proposed  six-week paid maternity leave as federal policy.But so far Republicans have been hellbent on proposing a “budget-neutral approach to parental leave” and it’s resulted in proposals that neither conservatives nor liberals are getting behind.Here are some of the proposals Republicans have put forward so far:1) In 2017 Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) got her proposalpassed in the Republicans’ tax cut laof up to 25 percent for businesses offering paid family leave for up to 12 weeks. The tax credit applies if the company reimburses at least 50 percent of the income and if workers earn less than $72000 a year. It’s not yet clear if businesses are actually capitalizing on the tax credit or how many people are benefiting.2) Republicans like Rep. John Katko (R-NY)— a tax-advantaged account with which parents can save to take leave. Of course the inherent problem with tax-savings accounts is that many lower income families don’t have money to save in the first place tax-advantaged or not.3) Two main conservative proposals around a paid federal family leave program — one being from Rubio and the other from Ernst and Lee —tap into Social Security benefits earlydelay their retirement benefits in the futur. It’s an idea that came from the Independent Women’s Forum a conservative nonprofit and is designed to only impact those that choose to take the benefit. The idea behind these two proposals is that they don’t create a new revenue source. But that creates an interesting dilemma. Social Security isn’t a personal insurance program it’s a communal pool and pulling out of it early could drive a hole into benefits overall. The Ernst-Lee proposal tries to mitigate this by having the Treasury reimburse the funds whereas the Rubio proposal does not.“The worst-case scenario to use existing government program could actually destroy Social Security” Jessica Mason a policy expert with the National Partnership for Women and Families said.The idea is not getting much love on the right either. Daniel Horowitz editor of the Conservative Review summed up the proposal as simply “adding a new entitlement while exacerbating the decline of another.”“Raise your hand if you believe for a second that once we allow a new entitlement to pop out of the genie’s bottle it somehow won’t become its own fiscal mandate minus the funding from Social Security”. “Also raise your hand if you believe we have the guts to deny these people their Social Security once this generation of young parents drawing upon the perspective family leave program reaches retirement.”Another conservative commentator Tiana Lowe with the Washington Examiner made the same case as Horowitzsaying the math doesn’t add up for Rubio’s proposa. Of course there’s been conservative pushback to federal paid family leave all along. Here’s how Rachel Greszler with the reacted to Trump’s campaign pledge to establish federal paid maternity leave:This would establish a new national entitlement program that could expand along the same lines as other federal entitlements potentially costing hundreds of billions of dollars per year. A federal PFL could dismantle existing private and state policies that are arguably better equipped to meet their unique workers’ and populations’ needs and would push at least part of the cost of existing programs onto federal taxpayers.The ideas and the backlash show the line conservatives have to walk to get on board with a paid federal family leave programs. They see an economic and family benefit to paid federal leave but they don’t like the idea of a creating a new “entitlement” program and haven’t been willing to create a new revenue source to support it.The major flaws of Republicans’ proposals so faSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) wants to find a bipartisan compromise on paid family leave.Cassidy himself outlined the challenges Republicans are facing with their proposals so far.AEI-Brookings study on paid family leav which states families with income less than $70000 are in most need of a federal paid family leave proposal Cassidy said he is analyzing the current Republicans proposals from the perspective of lower income Americans — and they fall short.He used the example of a lower-income woman: Not college educated limited in her salary making ends meet paycheck to paycheck. That woman Cassidy said is “probably unlikely to borrow from future Social Security and pay it back because she is struggling to make it happen. She is probably unlikely to do a voluntary credit account because again let’s assume she’s incredibly frugal. But she is paying her rent she’s paying everything else we hope she is doing a 529 for her kids’ education maybe a health savings account for a family. This would be a third account and I think that would be a little less likely.”This is the biggest flaw of these proposals.“The bigger picture is that these are all operating from a space of scarcity with respect of what is provided to people and with respect to revenue” Shabo said of all the Republican proposals. In other words none of them are creating new revenue sources; they’re asking people to make tradeoffs in situations that tradeoffs often can’t be made like elder care and retirement. Democrats have approached family leave by establishing a new tax; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has a proposal that would provide three months of family leave — whether they were a caregiver for a family member or a new parent — reimbursing 66 percent of workers’ salaries including at least $250 per month to each worker capped at $4000 per month per person. It pays for it through a 0.2 percent payroll tax on worker’s wages split between an employee and employer. Hillary Clinton in 2016 had a proposal that implemented a wealth tax.But the idea of a new tax is already proving to be difficult for Republicans to swallow. Cassidy called a possible payroll tax “regressive” and it’s not clear what he and Sinema can build bipartisan support for.There’s precedent for bipartisan work on paid family leavSenator-elect Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is going to lead the Democratic side of this bipartisan paid family leave push in the Senate.The bottom line is that paid family leave is incredibly popular and there is broad consensus that the outcomes of taking leave are positive across parties. A 2018 survey fromthe National Partnership for Women and Familie showed 84 percent of Americans across both parties supporting a federal paid family leave program.Lawmakers on the state level recognize this. In Washington state for example the state legislature passed a Paid Family and Medical Leave program in 2017 with bipartisan support. Their program a compromise between Republican and Democratic lawmakers has both employers and employees paying into a system with a payroll tax set at 0.4 percent of wages; 63 percent of the tax is paid by employees and 37 percent paid by the employers. The benefit is calculated based on wage and workers who make less than the state’s average wage would get 90 percent of the salary reimbursed for about 12 weeks.according to the Seattle Time an employee making $50000 annually would pay $2.42 a week their employer would pay $1.42 a week and they’d get a weekly benefit of about $703.Massachusetts under Republican Gov. Charlie Bakerpassed a paid family leave bill in 201 which provides 12 weeks of paid family leave for new parents and up to 20 weeks of medical leave for caretaking with a capped benefits of 64 percent of the state average weekly wage or $850 a week. It’s paid through a 0.63 percent payroll tax split almost evenly between employees and employers.All to say there is precedent for bipartisan work on paid family leave that Cassidy and Sinema could tap into.Of course the polling gets more complicated when Americans are asked how they want to pay for this program federally. As conservatives are quick to point out support for the program does drop whenAmericans are told what the annual taxes would amounto in a lump sum.Ironically however polling both from thethe National Partnership for Women and Familiefound the least popular method to pay for family leave is what Republicans keep proposing: cutting into Social Security early.Rep.

Trump’s asylum judges comment briefly explained - VoLog In or Sign UTrump isn’t getting rid of immigration judges — but his administration is still making it harder to seek asyluDonald Trump is not a reliable source on his administration’s immigration policy.Trump isn’t getting rid of immigration judges — but his administration is still making it harder to seek asyluPresident Donald Trump talks to reporters while welcoming NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the White House on April 2 2019.If you take Donald Trump at his word he wants to get rid of judges.But it is a bad idea to take Donald Trump at his word or to assume that just because Trump says he wants a thing that thing is going to happen.During a rambling press appearance Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg Trump went on a brief rant about all the changes to immigration policy he wanted Congress to pass featuring some old favorites — like ending “chain migration” and the visa lottery — but including a new spin on Trump’s attacks on asylum seekers:And we have to do something about asylum. And to be honest with you you have to get rid of judges.Every time — and you won’t even believe this Mr. Secretary General — you catch somebody that’s coming illegally into your country and they bring them to a court. But we can’t bring them to a court because you could never have that many judges. So they take their name they take their information and they release them. Now we don’t release too many. We keep them. It’s called “catch and keep.” But you don’t have facilities for that. But you have to bring them through a court system. If they touch your land —one foot on your land: “Welcome to being Perry Mason. You now have a big trial.”The “we have to get rid of judges” comment has raised some alarm from people who are especially attuned to any apparent Trump attack on democratic legitimacy and the rule of law. Even people who are properly understanding the “judges” comment as being about immigration judges are taking this as a serious declaration by Trump that he wants to end due process for people seeking asylum in the United States.Although the comment is a vivid example of the president’s attitude toward migrants who have a legal right to seek asylum in the US given that it was part of a press appearance in which Trump lied about his father’s birthplace and repeatedly pronounced “origins” as “oranges” it would be foolish to take this comment as a statement of imminent administration policy.The Trump administration is trying to allow fewer asylum seekersUnsurprisingly Trump’s comments do not reflect the reality of American immigration law.People apprehended crossing into the US without papers specifically do nohave the right to a hearing before an immigration judge to determine if they can be deported (unlike people arrested by immigration agents while living in the US). They’re eligible for what’s called “expedited removal” or deportation without a court hearing.However the US has an obligation under domestic and international law not to return people to persecution — something that could happen if everyone were deported with no questions asked. So if a migrant says she fears persecution in her home country she has a right to a screening interview with an asylum officer to see if she’ll be allowed to apply for asylum in the US.This is what Trump is talking about with his “one foot on your land” comment — the right to seek asylum is triggered as soon as a migrant sets foot on US soil which is why the Trump administration is more successful alimiting asylum seekers from entering the US at ports of entrtrying to stop people from being able to seek asylum after they’d arriveIf the asylum officer determines during the screening interview that the migrant has a “credible fear” of persecution if returned the asylum seeker is allowed to stay file an application and get a hearing before a judge. If the asylum officer determines there isn’t a credible fear the asylum seeker can appeal the decision to a judge but the odds of getting a judge to overturn a negative finding are diminishing under Trump.“Credible fear” is a deliberately generous standard because it is designed to reduce the odds that someone is sent back who should be protected. The standard for the judge approving the asylum application is deliberately higher.The gap between approval rates for the two is a source of great frustration for the Trump administration which sees it as evidence of either outright fraud or at least overly generous screening processes. (The argument is that between an asylum seeker passing her credible fear screening and having her court appearance she could disappear into the US as an unauthorized immigrant; while a substantial number of families seeking asylum don’t show up for court hearings it’s not at all clear that the majority of them are deliberately absconding.)But the administration’s solution isn’t to eliminate the court process. It’s to have fewer people pass the credible fear screening.Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a ruling last year limiting the extent to which victims of domestic and gang violence could claim persecution — his ruling initially applied to screening interviews as well as the final evaluation of asylum applications until a judgeruled against its use in “credible fear” screenings in Decembe. The Trump administration’s asylum ban attempted to hold asylum seekers who crossed between ports of entry to a higher standard — known as “reasonable fear” — to avoid deportation without a hearing; that also got struck down in court.Currently under the Migrant Protection Protocols some migrants are being held to an even higher standard to avoid being returned to Mexico while their asylum cases are on a judicial docket. That policy hasn’t yet been struck down by a judge. But even asylum seekers who fail that screening are going before an immigration judge; it’s just a matter of forcing them to wait in Mexico before they do it.Recent reports from Border Patrol union officers indicate the administration may be trying to take credible fear screenings out of asylum officers’ hands entirely and having Border Patrol agents do them themselves — which union officials assume will lead to fewer migrants passing the screenings. That also raises a lot of legal and policy questions and may or may not happen especially since Border Patrol agents are already overwhelmed in dealing with unprecedented numbers of families coming into the US without papers.Trump occasionally insists on something vehemently enough that his administration is forced to create a policy that resembles his rants but it’s not very frequent. Instead the story of immigration under the Trump administration is that the administration is doing a lot of things that Trump may not know about or understand.Rep.

Trump closing Mexican border: avocado prices affected - VoLog In or Sign UA US-Mexico border shutdown would affect far more than avocado priceSo why do people continue to freak out about them?A US-Mexico border shutdown would affect far more than avocado priceThe price of Hass avocados from the Mexican region of Michoacán rose by a staggering 34 percent on Tuesday.You may have heard that the president is threatening tunless the Mexican government stops Central American migrants from entering the US — something it is already working to do. You also may have heard that if the presidentmake good on his threat the price of avocados could skyrocket.about the possibility of an impending avocado shortage — CBthat the US could “run out of avocados in 3 weeks” if the border were to close. Importers seem to be taking heed of these warnings: The price of Hass avocados from the Mexican region of Michoacán rose by a staggering 34 percent on Tuesday which anotes is the commodity’s biggest one-day gain in a decade.wrote on Monday the price of avocados is just one thing that would be affected by a border shutdown. Shoppers on the US side of the border would see the price of many fruits and vegetables — including tomatoes strawberries grapes and mangoes — jump. American manufacturers many of which export goods to Mexico or use Mexican materials in their products would suffer under President Trump’s proposed shutdown. Thmillion-plus people who commute across the bordeeach day would face major disruptions as well.So why is everyone focusing on avocados?The simplest explanation is that Mexico grows more avocados than any other place in the world — about one-third of all avocados are grown in Mexico according tby the New York Times. The average consumer eats about 7 pounds of avocado per year. The fruit has been hailed as a superfood and more recentlyderided as a signifier of millennial exces almost half of all restaurant menus across the country include avocados in some form. There’s evenAvocados are everywhere: in our grocery stores on our brunch menus and in viral stories about the personal and professional failures of an entire generation. As Emily Atkin wrote fo all these stories about avocados are a way of tricking people “into caring about something that [they] might not otherwise whether it be climate change or a border shutdown or millennial spending habits.” It makes sense that journalists would use a potential avocado shortage as the hook for a story about the effects of a border shutdown. After all it’s easier to imagine not being able to buy an avocado than it is to wrap your head around the fact that American manufacturers could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.Atkin also points out that instead of using a potential avocado shortage as a lead-in to a bigger story about the implications of the border shutdown many outlets are focusing on a still-nonexistent avocado catastrophe as if it were one of the bigger — or only — consequences of shutting down all ports of entry along the southern border.Yesterday’s jump in avocado prices can be thought of as a warning about what could happen to a number of products and industries if Trump gets his way — but if the border does shut down an avocado shortage will be the least of our problems.Want more stories from The Goods by Vox?Sign up for our newsletter here.Amazon eBay and Alibaba sell tons of counterfeits.

Wall Street’s Fearless Girl: State Street isn’t always pro-woman - VoLog In or Sign UThe firm behind Wall Street’s Fearless Girl statue isn’t as pro-woman as it could bThe Fearless Girl is an empty marketing ploy masquerading as female empowerment.The firm behind Wall Street’s Fearless Girl statue isn’t as pro-woman as it could bThe Fearless Girl statue across from the New York Stock Exchange.statue on Wall Street isn’t as into gender diversity as it claims at least according to one measure.The investment management company State Street Corporation has positioned itself as an advocate for women and gender diversity in corporate America in recent years. In 2016 State Streetan investment fund devoted to gender-diverse companies and the following year itof the Fearless Girl staring down the Charging Bull in New York City’s Financial District. (The Fearless Girl statue hasto across from the New York Stock Exchange a couple of blocks away.)new report from the investment research company Morningsta State Street might not be putting its money — or rather its shareholder votes — where its mouth is on promoting women in the upper echelons of corporations.Of the 10 times its gender diversity fund used its shareholder votes to weigh in on a gender diversity or pay equity proposal for one of the companies it invests in over a three-year period the fund only voted in favor of the proposal twice. Six times it voted against the proposal and twice it abstained. Morningstar compared it to two other gender-focused funds the Glenmede Women in Leadership US Equity Portfolio and the Pax Ellevate Global Women’s Leadership Fund which voted for diversity and pay equity proposals every time.While it’s not the end of the world that State Street doesn’t always vote to support gender diversity it’s not a great look either. Investors in its diversity fund think they’re putting their money toward something they believe in and it appears that’s not always the case.It also makes the whole idea around the Fearless Girl feel like a bit of a fraud. Yes the image of a little girl standing defiantly with her hands on her hips is evocative. But a corporation leveraging feminism for marketing feels pretty cynical especially if it’s not advocating for women as much as it claims.The Fearless Girl’s message isn’t necessarily a bad one but it’s also important to remember what the statue is: a marketing ploy masked as a symbol of female empowerment.What’s up with State Street’s voteTo back up a little bit the fund in question is theState Street SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ET better known by its ticker SHE. An ETF is an exchange-traded fund which invests in a basket of publicly traded companies; investors can then invest in it and trade it like a stock. Basically the ETF invests in a group of stocks and you and I buy into the ETF.The basket of companies SHE holds arecompanies that fit its definitioof gender diverse in senior leadership positions — right now its biggest holdings are Johnson &amp; Johnson Home Depot and Mastercard.Shareholders in stocks of publicly traded companies have a certain set of rights related to that investment including the right to vote on certain corporate matters including members of the board of directors executive pay packages and questions related to diversity and pay equity. The SHE ETF is a shareholder of the companies it invests in so it votes.According to Morningstar’s tracking from July 2015 to the end of June 2018 SHE voted on 10 shareholder proposals on diversity reporting pay equity and other gender-related measures. It only voted in favor of the proposals twice.Some of the proposals State Street rejected didn’t get much support among shareholders in the first place. For example it voted against shareholder proposals inat TJX Companies which owns brands such as T.J. Maxx and Marshalls that would have required the company’s compensation committee to include diversity metrics among senior executives as a performance measure when setting the CEO’s compensation. The measure in both 2016 and 2017 got around 5 percent of shareholder support.The proposals State Street voted for appeared to be safer ones that were generally more popular among shareholders. For example it supported the disclosure of workforce gender and race data from Lam Research Corporation which had 77 percent support. And it abstained twice on two other proposals that again had relatively strong support among shareholders.All the proposals State Street voted against had less than 20 percent support from shareholders. If you look at it one way the firm could just have been siding with general sentiment. On the other if the whole idea is that it’s going to push companies on diversity shouldn’t it be willing to go against the tide? If the premise here is that a more diverse leadership group breeds more success why not support a proposal to measure a CEO’s performance at least in part on that?Olivia Offner a spokesperson for State Street said in a statement that the firm has “engaged with hundreds of companies on the importance of diversity voted against directors over 1000 times for lack of board gender diversity and been a vocal proponent of the value of diversity in writing and speech.” She said that examining its voting record on proposals “that have significant variations in language year over year” doesn’t tell the full story.“We do not simply consider the topic being addressed in a shareholder proposal when deciding how to vote; rather we vote on a case-by-case basis taking into account each company’s unique circumstances and the level of disclosure relative to our expectations” she said.Morningstar notes that the company’s gender diversity fund voting record is in line with its overall approach; taking voting action is seeThe Fearless Girl is cool — and she also kind of suckWhen the Fearless Girl statue landed in downtown Manhattan to commemorate International Women’s Day 2017 it was exciting. And it was a powerful image: a small proud girl standing up to a charging bull in the financial center of the world.A statue of a young girl staring down the Wall Street bull just appeared – a day beforeTourists and passersby flocked to snap pictures with her (though less so now that she’s in front of the stock exchange and not the bull) and it’s hard not to feel that the concept is frankly pretty neat. But you dig a little deeper and it starts to feel less great.Soon after the Fearless Girl was unveiled longtime financial writer Susan Antillapointed out the hypocrisy in a note to the girl herselBut let’s get real girlfriend. State Street a leader in the “Wall Street wants women to get ahead really it does” arena hason its 14-member management committee andamong its 79 executive leaders. And in the financial world that makes State Street a diversity overachiever.The artist who created the bull in the late 1980s after the 1987 stock market crash Arturo Di Modicathat the placement of the Fearless Girl in front of his statue turned his work into something it was not. The bull was supposed to a symbol of American pride and resilience not aggression or threat. (He also argued that in placing the girl in front of the bull she became derivative of his work and therefore was a copyright infringement.)State Street has also had issues with the artist it commissioned to make the Fearless Girl statue Kristen Visbal. It’sover what it says are unauthorized reproductions of the statue.“While we are very proud to share Fearless Girl’s message with the world given the time energy and resources we have invested in the campaign we naturally must be very protective of how Fearless Girl is used by others particularly for commercial purposes” Offner said in a statement regarding its legal battle with Visbal. “As this is an ongoing legal matter we cannot comment further.”The Fearless Girl may be an inspiring symbol but she’s also a business play.The news moves fast.

So this week Pittsburgh’s City Council did.On Tuesday the City Councilpassed three gun control billin a 6-3 vote. The measuresthe use of some assault weapons as well as most uses of armor-piercing ammunition and high-capacity magazines and let courts confiscate guns from people within city limits who are deemed an “extreme risk” to others or themselves.Mayor Bill Peduto has promised to sign the bills.“We have not been able to get any movement in Harrisburg and Washington and the answer is just don’t do nothing” Peduto said according to the. “We’ve seen what doing nothing has done. It has led to an escalation in severe mass murders. And we’re going to take action on a local level.”The shooter used an AR-15 an assault rifle and other weapons in the Pittsburgh shooting.One sticking point: Pennsylvania law blocks cities from regulating guns. But Pittsburgh officials argue they’ve found a workaround by prohibiting the “use” of such weapons not “possession.” Still the National Rifle Association already promised to challenge at least one of the laws in court with local activists planning legal action as well.It’s unclear how effective Pittsburgh’s legislation will be. Assault weapon and high-capacity ammo bansdon’t have strong evidence behind thefor reducing gun deaths overall although some experts argue that they could make mass shootings less deadly. Extreme risk laws also known as red flag laws do havebehind them particularly in reducing suicides.Even if the laws are effective they’ll be limited by local boundaries. Across the US that limitation has made it difficult for any city to act on its own in the face of gun violence. For example strict gun laws in Chicago areby the fact someone can simply cross the border to gun-friendly Indiana and buy a gun much more easily often not even leaving a paper trail.But as the federal and state governments fail to act on this issue officials in Pittsburgh felt like they had no other option to addressAmerica’s unique gun violence proble. The US has higher levels of gun violence than any other developed nation and it has thehighest levels of civilian gun ownership in the worlweakest gun laws in the developed worl. The research indicates that these weak gun laws and high rates of firearm ownership help drive the nation’s greater levels of gun violence.America’s gun problem briefly explaineAmerica’s gun problem comes down to two basic issues.First America has uniquely weak gun laws.at the very least require one or more background checks and almost always something more rigorous beyond that to get a gun from specific training courses to rules for locking up firearms to more arduous licensing requirements to specific justifications besides self-defense for owning a gun.In the US even a background check isn’t a total requirement; the current federal law is riddled with loopholes and snared by poor enforcement so there are many ways around even a basic background check. And if a state enacts stricter measures than federal laws someone can simply cross state lines to buy guns in a jurisdiction with looser rules. There are simply very few barriers if any to getting a gun in the US.Second the US has a ton of guns. It has far more than not just other developed nations but any other country period. Estimated for 2017 the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen a quasi-failed state torn by civil war where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents according to ananalysis from the Small Arms SurveBoth of these factors come together to make it uniquely easy for someone with any violent intent to find a firearm allowing them to carry out a horrific shooting.This is borne out in the statistics. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada more than seven times that of Sweden and nearly 16 times that of Germany according tofor 2012 compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has amuch higher overall homicide rat which includes non-gun deaths than other developed nations.)The research compiled by theHarvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Cente is also pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime places with more guns have more gun deaths. Researchers have found this to be true not just with(which in recent years wereby UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart based onfrom Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:Instead the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.“A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends family and peers. But in the US it’s much more likely that someone will get angry during an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone.To put it another way America does not have a monopoly on crime mental health issues bigots extremists or other factors commonly blamed for gun violence and mass shootings; what is unique about the US is that it makes it so easy for people with all sorts of motives to obtain a gun.Researchers have found that stricter gun laws could help. A 2016of 130 studies in 10 countries published inthat new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives. Areview of the US evidencalso linked some gun control measures including background checks to reduced injuries and deaths. Afrom Johns Hopkins researchers also supports laws that require a license to buy and own guns.That doesn’t mean that criminals bigots and extremists will never be able to carry out a shooting in places with strict gun laws. Even the strictest gun laws can’t prevent every shooting.And guns are not the only contributor to violence. Other factors include for example poverty urbanization alcohol consumption and the strength of criminal justice systems. But when researchers control for other confounding variables they have found time and time again that America’s loose access to guns is a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers.So America with its lax laws and abundance of firearms makes it uniquely easy for people to commit mass shootings. Until the US confronts that issue it will continue to see more gun deaths than the rest of the developed world.For more on America’s gun problem readRep.

"Trump’s long history of pushing wild misinformation about wind turbines - VoLog In or Sign UTrump’s long history of pushing wild misinformation about wind turbineThe president’s latest false claim about wind energy is his wildest yet.Trump’s long history of pushing wild misinformation about wind turbinePresident Donald Trump is a. That much has been clear for a long time. But during a speech on Tuesday evening he took the flawed arguments he’s been making against wind energy to new levels of absurdity.Addressing the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) Trump claimed that sounds made by wind turbines cause cancer.“If you have a windmill anywhere near your house congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value” Trump said. “And they say the noise causes cancer. You tell me that one okay? Rerrrr rerrrr!”TRUMP during NRCC speech: ""If you have a windmill anywhere near your house congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value. And they say the noise causes cancer. You tell me that one okay? Rerrrr rerrrr!""There is no evidence however that any sort of sound — including the low-frequency ones emitted by wind turbines — causes cancer. After all as Philip Jaeklwrote in the Atlantic in 201 if it were the case that wind turbine sounds could cause cancer you’d expect evidence of the connection to emerge among residents of countries that have lots of them like Denmark. But it hasn’t.[I]nfrasound from wind turbines is no different than infrasound caused by other harmless common sources. “Everyone is surrounded by infrasound every day. It’s emitted by natural sources like the surf storms wind itself our own heartbeat and respiration. We also are exposed to it in cars from ceiling fans motors and urban noise” says Simon Chapman a professor emeritus at the University of Sydney. “If wind turbines were harmful to nearby residents entire cities and small nations would be stricken across much of Europe where we see the highest density. Copenhagen is surrounded by turbines but my Danish colleagues are not seeing queues of sick people.”While there is no evidence that wind turbines cause cancer chemicals and particulates emitted during the processes of extracting and burning fossil fuelshave been linked with numerous health ailments including canceTrump’s claim that windmills drastically decrease property values is also false. Asin a recent fact-check of Trump’s comments about wind energy “[w]hile some properties can see a decrease in value when turbines are planned and constructed nearby several major academic studies found no statistically significant decrease in the average property value due to wind turbines in the US.”Trump has a long history of making bogus arguments about wind turbineTuesday evening was far from the first time Trump has pushed misinformation about wind energy. During a speech in Michigan last week he decried that the unreliability of wind means it’s impossible to watch TV on evenings where the wind isn’t blowing.“If Hillary got in … you’d be doing wind” Trump said. “Windmills. Weeeee. And if it doesn’t blow you can forget about television for that night. ‘Darling I want to watch television.’ ‘I’m sorry! The wind isn’t blowing.’ I know a lot about wind.”TRUMP: ""If Hillary got in... you'd be doing wind. Windmills. Weeeee. And if it doesn't blow you can forget about television for that night. 'Darling I want to watch television.' 'I'm sorry! The wind isn't blowing.' I know a lot about wind.""Trump’s comments betrayed ignorance of how batteries work and of the idea that wind is just one part of a broader renewable energy system.Asked about Trump’s remarks Michael Mann a professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State Universitythey amounted to “malicious ignorance.”“The truth is that a combination of wind solar and other renewables along with battery and smart grid technology can provide continuous and abundant electricity” Mann said.During previous speeches Trump hasbaselessly suggested wind turbines make easy targets for terrorist and claimed they are especially dangerous for birds. In fact fossil fuel power plantslead to far more bird deaths than wind turbineTrump’s NRCC speech — one in which he also pushed baseless claims about Democratic voter fraud — came at the end of a day in which he seemed to have a particularly tough time with basic facts even by his standards.During an Oval Office event with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday afternoon Trump falsely claimed his father was born in Germany and laterseemed to have a hard time speakin. Along similar lines he fretted aloud to his NRCC audience about the possibility that “someone’s gonna leak this whole damn speech to the medi” — despite the fact it was being recorded for television broadcast by C-SPAN and other outlets.The news moves fast.

Lucy Flores isn’t the only woman Joe Biden has touched inappropriately  - VoLucy Flores isn’t alone. Joe Biden has a long history of touching women inappropriately.The media gave Biden a pass for years. It won’t in 2020.Joe Biden delivers a speech in Dover Delaware on March 16 2019.Bastiaan Slabbers/NurPhoto via Getty ImageLucy Flores isn’t alone. Joe Biden has a long history of touching women inappropriately.Democrat Lucy Flores was preparing to give one of her final stump speeches in a race for lieutenant governor in Nevada when she felt two hands on her shoulders. She froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?” Flores wondered.with Joe Biden in a first-person essay for New York magazine describing an incident in 2014 when Biden came up behind her leaned in smelled her hair and kissed the back of her head.“Biden was the second-most powerful man in the country and arguably one of the most powerful men in the world” Flores wrote. “He was there to promote me as the right person for the lieutenant governor job. Instead he made me feel uneasy gross and confused.”New York magazine reached out to a Biden spokesperson who declined to comment. After the story ran Biden spokesperson Bill Russo said the former vice president and his staffFlores’s experience isn’t unique. It is no secret in Washington that Biden has touched numerous women inappropriately in public. It’s just never been treated as a serious issue by the mainstream press.Biden’s been caught on camera embracing a female reporter from behind and gripping herabove her waist just below her bus. At a swearing-in ceremony for Defense Secretary Ash Carter Biden put his hands on the shoulders of Stephanie Carter Carter’s wife and thenleaned in and whispered into her ea an incident widely discussed online. Since Flores’s piece published Carter has said did not feel but rather a reassuring gesture by an old friend.Still Biden has whispered into many. He’s also touched women’sduring other photo ops. Another woman Amy Lapposto say that at a fundraiser in 2009 he touched her face leaned in in what she thought was an attempt to kiss her on the mouth and then rubbed her nose with his. The incident bothered her. Two more womencame forward to the New York Times on Tuesda similarly describing behavior that made them uncomfortable.Biden has also been criticized for being too handsy with children. Once at a swearing-in ceremony for Sen. Chris Coons a Democrat from his home state of Delaware Biden held the upper arm of the senator’s preteen daughter leaned down and whispered into her ear as she became visibly uncomfortable. Then he kissed the side of her forehead a gesture that made the girl. Coons said at the time and reiterated this week that Biden’s words and actions did not bother his daughter who has known Biden her whole life.It’s all out in the open. News outlets wrote about these incidents. But the stories ran under light-hearted headlines like “Photo ofHere’s Joe Biden being Joe Biden with Ash Carter’s wif” a piece that I edited and now regret.Ideological media outlets did write some critical pieces during the Obama era. At the Federalist Mollie Hemingwaywhether liberals would tolerate the same conduct from a conservative. At Talking Points Memo Alana Levinson criticized liberals forBut overall Biden got a pass from the political media.Times have changed. Reporters now would look twice at a new politician who is handsy on camera. They’d ask questions about it and likely look into his private conduct. And women like Flores are taking big risks and speaking out.Biden avoided scrutiny in the past but if he wants to be the next president he’ll face pressure to account for his actions.The Onion satirized Biden in 2009 in athat cemented Biden’s image of a lovable everyman.Real Biden remembers his working-class Scranton roots. Onion Biden washes his Trans Am on the White House lawn. Real Biden is handsy with women. Onion Biden is a womanizer: “Hey hot stuff looking good” Onion Biden tells a passing aide. “Would you know where I could get a little bucket and sponge action? My mean machine needs to be cleaned.”The images bled together over the years into the persona of Uncle Joe. When he dropped an F-bomb on a live mic it was. When he made one of his many gaffes it got added to numerous lists. And when he did kind of creepy things to women at public events well that was just Joe being Joe too.All those frames made appealing pitches just a few years ago. Editors would be happy to get a “lovable Uncle Joe strikes again” story. The environment is not the same now. Certainly the media is not nearly perfect when it comes to covering gender and power. But in the era of #MeToo there is far less appetite for a story that makes light of a candidate behaving badly toward women.As Flores writes this conduct matters: “I’m not suggesting that Biden broke any laws but the transgressions that society deems minor (or doesn’t even see as transgressions) often feel considerable to the person on the receiving end. That imbalance of power and attention is the whole point — and the whole problem.”This is especially true in a context where Biden will be running against several women as well as defending a decades-long record of policymaking that’s involved past positions at odds with current Democratic Party orthodoxy.Biden once said a woman should not have the “sole right to say what should happen to her body”Biden 76 arrived in Washington at the age of 30. His substantial public record includes a mixed history on women’s issues a legacy that makes his in-person conduct even more worthy of discussion.unpacked his history on abortiofor the New York Times reporting that Biden who now supports abortion rights has not been a solid liberal on the issue for his whole career.In the Reagan era Biden voted for a bill in committee that NARAL called “the most devastating attack yet on abortion rights.” Biden who is Catholic said at the time: “I’m probably a victim or a product however you want to phrase it of my background.” He called the decision “the single most difficult vote I’ve cast as a U.S. senator.”He also held the opinion that the Supreme Court went “too far” in decidingIn an interview in 197 he said he did not think a woman should have the “sole right to say what should happen to her body.”Biden declined to speak with Lerer for her article so we don’t know exactly how and why he evolved on. A spokesperson for Biden did not respond to an email asking for comment.In his years in Washington though Biden has voted for bills that support abortion rights. He’s championed the Violence Against Women Act. And he’s spoken forcefully about the problem of sexual violence.Democrats need to figure out whether they want to clean houseIf Biden runs he’ll occupy a lane in the Democratic primary as the “normal” candidate — a likable white guy who won’t lose it on Twitter pander to Russia or throw children in cages at the border.As Democrats grapple with the intense desire to beat Trump in 2020 many arethat a woman will have a tough time beating him because of sexist attitudes still held by some voters. Perhaps the thinking goes it’s better to go with the kind of leader that Americans are used to. Biden who was in office for eight years under Obama could fit that bill.But he would still have to present a clear contrast to Trump. While Biden has not been accused of sexual assault (as Trump has a dozen times) and there are no tapes of Biden on the internet joking about grabbing women by the genitals there are tapes of Biden behaving inappropriately. One man’s behavior is far worse but that doesn’t excuse the other.Democrats are conflicted about what to do about this category of behavior. It’s not the same as what other men of the #MeToo movement have been accused of but it’s also not what liberals want to endorse. Sen.Al Franken’s resignation is still controversiafor this reason. Some Democrats feel the party is putting itself at a disadvantage against Republicans who let the president get away with far worse than any accusation Franken faced.Flores confronts the issue of whether some bad behavior is okay forcing us to consider what these seemingly small incidents are really like. “The vice-president of the United States of America had just touched me in an intimate way reserved for close friends family or romantic partners — and I felt powerless to do anything about it.”The Democratic Party is more than half women. More women than ever in history ran as Democrats in the 2018 elections — and won. They outperformed their male peers. They were central to Democrats retaking the House. Women are leading the sustained resistance to Trump. The party should be committed to making sure that women and girls participate in government and politics to their fullest potential. The party needs them.The question is whether the party needs a president who disrespects them.Rep.

Joe Biden Lucy Flores and the “Creepy Uncle Joe” problem - VoLog In or Sign UThe controversy over Joe Biden’s treatment of women explaineAn old-school politician in a #MeToo world.The controversy over Joe Biden’s treatment of women explaineJoe Biden’s presidential campaign has not yet launched but it’s already rocked by a long-simmering controversy over the propriety of his interactions with women.A former Nevada state legislator named Lucy Flores wrote a personal essay that New York magazine published on Friday in which she describes an encounter with Biden at a 2014 campaign event. Flores says the then-vice president came up behind her touched her shoulders and kissed the back of her head. The behavior she says wasn’t criminal but it made her feel uncomfortable. Amy Lappos a former congressional aide whorecalls Biden rubbing noses with her at a 2009 fundraise similarly says the incident “wasn’t sexual” but also that there’s “absolutely a line of decency” and “a line of respect” that Biden crossed. On Tuesdaytwo more women came forward to the New York Timewith similarly stories they described as having “made them uncomfortable.”Flores’s account has raised some of the usual questions about what exactly happened and whose memory is correct. But the real issue with Biden isn’t the facts. The issue is what standard of conduct is acceptable for men in power.The Onion’s parody character “Diamond Joe” Biden whose autobiography was titled was of course a joke. But the joke was that Biden really was an old-school presence in the Obama White House.That presence extended to a habit of quite publicly making remarks about women’s appearances and frequent physical contacts that any modern HR department would probably warn against. For years it was played off primarily as a joke — “Joe being Joe” — paired with some complaints from progressive writers and a larger volume of complaints from conservative writers that progressives were being hypocritical in not complaining about Biden.In the wake of the heightened mobilization of women in the Democratic Party and the #MeToo movement it was inevitable that this would become an issue if Biden ran for president. And even though he’s not quite in the race yet he and his camp keep very heavily hinting that he will be soon.The allegation isn’t that he has dark secrets but that the stuff we’ve seen on camera and laughed off should be taken seriously as making public life hostile to women. Critics fear this will bring to life their long-held nightmare of #MeToo overreach in which the idea of long-public behavior by a well-known and well-liked Democrat is suddenly unfairly castigated.Lucy Flores says Biden made her uncomfortableLucy Flores got elected to the Nevada House of Representatives at 31 years old and was quickly marked as a rising star in the state party getting the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor in 2014. She wound up losing fairly badly in an overall disastrous election year for Democrats and then went on in the 2016 cycle to endorse Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign while waging a primary campaign of her own for a congressional seat. (She wound up losing to Ruben Kihuen who in turn later ended upforced out of Congress by a sexual harassment scanda.) She was then a founding board member of Sanders’s national political organization Our Revolutionbut wound up resigning earlAll of which is to say that while she’s now a somewhat marginalized figure in Democratic politics in 2014 she was very much in the middle of things — backed by Harry Reid for a big role in the future of the Nevada Democratic Party and getting campaign visits from Biden an extremely popular surrogate.But Flores recounts that Biden’s campaign rally on her behalf wound up taking an unsettling turn:I found my way to the holding room for the speakers where everyone was chatting taking photos and getting ready to speak to the hundreds of voters in the audience. Just before the speeches we were ushered to the side of the stage where we were lined up by order of introduction. As I was taking deep breaths and preparing myself to make my case to the crowd I felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. “Why is the vice-president of the United States touching me?”I felt him get closer to me from behind. He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified. I thought to myself “I didn’t wash my hair today and the vice-president of the United States is smelling it. And also what in the actual fuck? Why is the vice-president of the United States smelling my hair?” He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn’t process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused. There is a Spanish saying “” it means “earth swallow me whole.” I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything. I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me. My name was called and I was never happier to get on stage in front of an audience.That’s all there is to it. Flores doesn’t allege that Biden did anything illegal followed up in any way threatened or derailed her career in any way or anything else. She’s just saying that there she was a young female professional doing her job alongside an older male colleague. He was supposed to be there to help her out and instead he made her uncomfortable by sniffing her hair and kissing the back of her head.And while the specific incident is new the basic idea that Biden sometimes says and does things that make some of the women in his presence uncomfortable is really not much of a secret.Joe Biden does slightly inappropriate stuff all the timAfter Biden oversaw the swearing-in of new senators in the wake of the 2016 election Politico posted a video compilation of “13 awkward moments” from the ceremony.The first such moment is Biden saying that when he was young he had a beautiful sister and his dad told him his “number one job” was “to keep the guys away from your sister”; he then turns to a brother-sister pair and addresses the young man by saying “You’re in trouble.” In the next he asks a newly elected senator’s daughter how old she is. She says she’s 16 and Biden jokes “I hope you’ve got big dogs around the house” to keep the boys away from her.These are obviously jokes. Biden is being friendly and not trying to hurt anyone and we’re all familiar with this general style of joke.At the same time these jokes have gone out of style because their major premise is that women’s sexuality should be controlled by their male relatives rather than by themselves. They also seem at times to suggest that young men cannot be taught to behave themselves appropriately around attractive women. In his official role Biden is part of the whose idea is that men need to be leaders in checking other men’s sexual misconduct. But in the jokes rather than men working with other men to build a culture of consent and respect for women the thing to do is to get big dogs to safeguard the women you happen to care about personally while otherwise accepting that boys will be boys.In February 2015 New York magazine did a slideshow of“nine times Joe Biden creepily whispered in people’s ears”and Byron York observed that there’s ahuge public track record of “handsy” Biden photothat liberals would likely regard as problematic were the perpetrator not a popular Democratic vice president.Around this time controversy was raging mostly in conservative circles. GOP operative Karol Morkowicz wrote in a February 2015 Time article that“America Shouldn’t Tolerate ‘Biden Being Biden.’”But Alana Levinson wrote for TPM at around this time that theconservative critics were basically righand progressives shouldn’t give Biden a pass just because they agreed with his stances on policy.“Being a public figure who supports women means more than just supporting political causes” she wrote. “It also means treating them with respect especially in public. If progressives are really committed to combating sexism they have to be indiscriminate about calling it out — even if it means indicting one of their own.”Biden’s allies say he’s getting a bad raOne of the most infamous Biden photos is a still taken from larger video of him grabbing the shoulders of Stephanie Carter the wife of Ashton Carter during Carter’s swearing-in ceremony to become secretary of defense.In the wake of Flores’s storyCarter addressed the images in a Medium pos which said both that she had no problem with what Biden did and that in her view the viral image was an out-of-context frame from a moment that looks more innocuous on video (emphasis in original):We had started the cold snowy day at Arlington Cemetery in Section 60 visiting the graves of our fallen. It was somber and quiet and the weight of Ash’s new responsibility was palpable. Upon our arrival at the Pentagon I had slipped and fell on some ice  —  which a few journalists were nice enough to tweet about. Later we went to the White House for the swearing in and I was feeling self-conscious and tentative (not a normal state for those who know me) about the fall  —  and perhaps about how much our life might change. As we walked in the room reporters were staged and a young woman from Huffington Post shouted to me to ask if I was doing all right  —  I was somewhat thrown (did I not look all right?) but quickly remembered news of my fall on the ice had traveled. By the time then-Vice President Biden had arrived he could sense I was uncharacteristically nervous and quickly gave me a hug. After the swearing in as Ash was giving remarks he leaned in to tell me “thank you for letting him do this” and kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support.But a still shot taken from a video  —  misleadingly extracted from what was a longer moment between close friends —   sent out in a snarky tweet  —  came to be the lasting image of that day.Some people I’ve spoken to agree with Carter about the video versus still question and others don’t. The bottom line however is that Carter says she didn’t have a problem with it — which is of course fine — but Flores says shehave a problem with what Biden did.Henry Muñoz of the Latino Victory Projec meanwhile put out a statement saying he “thoroughly reviewed photographic documentation from the event” and spoke to others who were there and “to the best of our recollection at no time were Lucy Flores and Vice President Biden alone.”The implication of this is that Flores is lying (or perhaps misremembering) her story but if you read her account she clearly says that she wasn’alone with Biden. And of course the larger narrative about Biden isn’t that he does these things secretly behind closed doors — he does them with the C-SPAN cameras rolling at public events. The question is whether it’s bad.Biden issued a statement that was more equivocal — trying to neither apologize to Flores nor call her a liar while also addressing the larger question without really saying anything about it:In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life I have offered countless handshakes hugs expressions of affection support and comfort. And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention.I may not recall these moments the same way and I may be surprised at what I hear. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences and men should pay attention. And I will.I will also remain the strongest advocate I can be for the rights of women. I will fight to build on the work I’ve done in my career to end violence against women and ensure women are treated with the equality they deserve. I will continue to surround myself with trusted women advisors who challenge me to see different perspectives than my own. And I will continue to speak out on these vitally important issues where there is much more progress to be made and crucial fights that must be waged and won.These are all nice sentiments and they underscore one of the reasons nobody in progressive politics has been particularly eager to bring this up. Biden is a personally very well-liked member of the Democratic Party establishment nobody really thinks he meant any harm and were he quietly fading into an elder statesman role everyone might leave well enough alone. But Biden is putting himself forward as a political leader for the present-day and his conduct does not really fit cutting-edge progressive values. You can clearly see that even in this statement which centers his subjective intentions rather than women’s experiences.Meanwhile Biden’s team is pushing back more forcefully with spokesperson Bill Russo emailing a “note on recent coverage” to many Washington journalists noting Carter’s Medium piece and statements from Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) arguing that another widely snarked-about photo of Biden with Coons’s daughter has been misrepresented. Russo says “the familiar characterizations of these two photos that have been uncritically perpetuated turn out to be very false” and points journalists to aWashington Post interview with Coonin which he says “all three of my kids have known Joe their whole lives” and view him like a grandfather.Can women really “relate their experiences”?One important question raised by Biden’s statement however is whether it’s true that we have now entered an era where “women feel they can and should relate their experiences.”It’s clearly true that some womenrelating their experiences. But Brett Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court while Christine Blasey Ford faced months of threats. Justin Fairfax is still lieutenant governor of Virginia. Donald Trump is the president of the United States. A key mover and shaker in US Latino politics is calling Flores a liar based on a pretty blatant misreading of what she said happened. Flores herself has landed in an odd position politically alienating the establishment over the course of the 2016 cycle and then breaking with Sanders and moving to California where she’s now out of electoral politics. She has relatively little to lose in this by speaking out.But would a random midlevel Obama administration staffer teenage senator’s daughter or former candidate who was once made uncomfortable by a Biden joke or lean really feel that the moral of the story is she should feel free to speak her mind? Or would she understand that to get ahead in life it’s good to be seen as a helpful team player and bad to be seen as a thin-skinned troublemaker and the best thing to do is either shrug it off or speak up in Biden’s defense? Does anyone trying to make a career in Democratic Party politics really want to put themselves in the position of being a “Joe Biden accuser” who gets to have their conduct picked over by aThe skeptical reaction to Flores from many who are not disputing the factual contents of her story underscores how central it is to some of the ideological fault lines in American life. Nobody disagrees that men shouldn’t rape women or that women who haven’t been raped shouldn’t falsely accuse men of raping them. But there is a really big disagreement over whether American culture ought to change in a major way or whether the real problem is “millennial snowflakes” out-of-control political correctness and a zealous neo-Puritanism that can’t even take a joke or see an affectionate gesture for what it is.Biden’s problem is also his appeaA lot of how Biden got to be vice president in the first place had to do with the idea that he would help Obama appeal to the kind of voters — older less educated white Northerners who aren’t evangelical Christians — who we know eventually ended up defecting to Trump.These voters didn’t identify with the GOP of the George W. Bush era and certainly didn’t love Republicans’ regressive economic policies. But theydon’t particularly identify with the self-consciously woke brand of liberalism practiced in big cosmopolitan metro areas. For the purposes of winning votes from this cohort the fact that Biden’s 2008 primary campaign wasby racist gaffes probably made him a strong running mate. To voters confused — and at times angered — by shifting cultural norms the fact that Obama would elevate an old white guy who clearly wasn’t up to speed on all the latest PC thinking was a powerful demonstration that he was one of the good ones.In 2016 of course many voters inclined to this way of thinking did defect to Trump. In 2018 Democrats in turn did well in large part by gaining more votes from people whose thinking is not necessarily in line with contemporary progressive politics on key identity issues.John Ray of Data for Progress shows for example that the swing voters Democrats won in 2018 are closer to Republicans’ views on the Confederate flag.Biden is probably not going to run around explicitly pitching himself as the Democrat who is best suited to appeal to Lost Cause mythos (though he did oncebrag that Delaware was a slave stat) but the idea that he’s better suited than the rest of the field to win back Trump voters in the Midwest is an integral element of his proto-candidacy.And the idea that Biden is less of an uptight scoldy asshole than your average Democrat — the kind of guy who’s not afraid to crack a joke about using dogs to guard a 16-year-old’s virtue or get a little grabby at a happy occasion — is an integral part of that argument.Totally separately from this controversy Biden is not very popular among the group of younger highly educated more ideological Democrats who dominate online discourse and the “Creepy Uncle Joe” persona only ads to that disdain. But his base in the party is older more working-class and more moderate Democrats for whom the inclination to give a guy a hard time for just being good-natured and affectionate is everything that’s gone wrong with the younger generation. To Biden’s mostly younger critics the extent to which this kind of behavior is normalized and people are just supposed to accept it without complaint is exactly what needs to change.#MeToo: Sexual harassment and assault allegations continue to surface across industrieThe controversy over Joe Biden’s treatment of women explaineAfter investigating Neil deGrasse Tyson for sexual misconduct TV networks aren’t sharing detailBarcelona’s remarkable history of rebirth and transformatioCars dominate cities today.

House Judiciary authorizes subpoenas for Mueller report - VoLog In or Sign UHouse Judiciary committee authorizes subpoenas for full Mueller reporThe subpoenas haven’t yet been issued though. Here’s what comes next.House Judiciary committee authorizes subpoenas for full Mueller reporAttorney General William Barr now says he plans to release the Mueller report with some redactions by mid-April. But House Democrats are saying that’s nowhere near good enough.On Wednesday the House Judiciary CommitteeChairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) to issue subpoenas to try and get Mueller’s full report as well as underlying evidence and other materials.Now these subpoenas have not yet been issued — Nadler says he’ll still give Barr a chance to comply voluntarily. But hehis committee to see the full Mueller report “without redactions” and “without delay.”It’s highly unlikely that a totally unredacted Mueller report will be released to the public anytime soon. The full report likely addresses sensitive intelligence topics and investigations that are still continuing.So the real battle here is on two main fronts:How much of the publicly released report will be redacted?Barr says he plans to redact four types of information: grand jury material sensitive intelligence matters that could affect ongoing investigations and infringements on the privacy rights of “peripheral third parties.” Furthermore it is possible that President Donald Trump will try to assert executive privilege to block the release of some information. Democrats and others will likely push to minimize the number and nature of those redactions.Will key members of Congress get to review the unredacted report in a private setting?Though a full release of the public report isn’t in the cards one possibility is that the Justice Department could let members of Congress review it for themselves to assure them there’s no malfeasance or cover-up. This could be the “Gang of Eight” (the House and Senate leaders and intelligence committee chairs and ranking members) the House Judiciary Committee or some other restricted group.Nadler’s subpoena threat could be a hard-nosed negotiating tactic in hopes of getting Barr to make more concessions toward Democrats’ demands than he’s currently offering. If his committee does issue subpoenas to try to force the report’s release though a lengthy legal battle will likely ensue. And there will beto try to force the disclosure of more information.The redacted Mueller report explaineAfter a week of ambiguity Barr confirmed last Friday that he did indeed plan to release Mueller’s report itself rather than writing his own summary of it. “I do not believe it would be in the public’s interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report” theBut Barr also made clear that he only intends to release a redacted version of the report and he explained what types of information he planned on redacting.. Mueller convened a grand jury to issue subpoenas and hear witness testimony. The grand jury is a powerful investigative tool — witnesses have to come in and testify alone without even their lawyers. Accordingly there arereleasing secret grand jury material.This poses the prospect that any information Mueller obtained through the grand jury process — but that hasn’t already been made public — will be redacted from Barr’s version of Mueller’s report. The attorney generalthat some of this information “by law cannot be made public.” It’s unclear how much of the report’s information this would apply to (though the grand jury is known to have been used more for Mueller’s Russian interference probe than his obstruction of justice probe). Another key question is how broadly Barr will interpret “grand jury information” or whether he will actively try to push for more disclosureStill even if Barr does redact a great deal there will be other efforts to make this information public. For instance the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Pressthe judge overseeing that grand jury on Monday and asked her to “enable the release of the Special Counsel’s Report to the public to the greatest extent possible.” According tothat judge — Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the US District Court in DC — “has sided with significant public access attempts in the past.”2) Material that the intelligence community thinks could compromise sensitive sources and method: Mueller’s investigation which tried to assess the Russian government’s interference with the 2016 election surely used a great deal of sensitive intelligence information. Accordingly Barr says he’ll redact any information that could compromise secret sources or methods of intelligence collection.This issue has already come up in the context of the Russia probe. Back when Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA)on FISA surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page he faced a chorus of criticism from Democrats for potentially revealingThere are undoubtedly cases in which sensitive sources do need to be shielded but critics have argued that government tends to use the “sources and methods” justification too broadly to try and conceal information officials don’t want to get out.3) Material that could affect ongoing “matters”: Barr’s letters and previous public reporting have made clear that Mueller looked into several issues that he did not resolve but rather ended up handing off to other Justice Department offices for further investigation.We don’t know how many matters Mueller referred elsewhere. These could be mainly about third-tier players unconnected to Trump but they could also be about potential crimes in Trumpworld that didn’t tie directly to “Russian interference with the 2016 election.” In any case the Justice Department won’t want to reveal any information that could affect ongoing investigations.4) Information that could affect the privacy and reputational interests of “peripheral third parties”: Barr’s fourth category of redactions is an interesting one. Before this letter many speculated he would attempt to redact information relating to uncharged individuals. But this appears to be a much more narrowly tailored category: “peripheral third parties.” It’s unclear what information the Mueller report might contain that could affect the privacy of unimportant players.In any case these are the four categories of redactions that Barr says he currently plans to make. All of these could be applied in a reasonable way or they could be overused to hide an excessive amount of information — it’s not clear how Barr will apply them yet.There’s one more way information from the Mueller report could theoretically be blocked from public release — if the president asserts executive privilege over it.This could be particularly important for Mueller’s obstruction of justice findings. As the obstruction investigation was taking place in 2017 White House lawyer Ty Cobb agreed to make many White House officials available for interviews. But there was a condition: Trump wanted to reserve the right to assert executive privilege over information they provided later on. According to Trump’s lawyers Mueller agreed to these terms.Trump’s former lawyer John Dowdasserted last week on Byron York’s podcasthat he expected the president to take advantage of that deal and use executive privilege to block a great deal of information in the report from being released.However Trump also said last week that it “wouldn’t bother me at all” for the Mueller report to be fully released.Then in Barr’s letter Friday he wrote: “Although the president would have the right to assert privilege over certain parts of the report he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and accordingly there are no plans to submit the report to the White House for a privilege review.”This language is hardly a rock-solid commitment. Some have argued that the letter’s language — “defer to me” seems to leave open the possibility that Barr himself will assert executive privilege on behalf of the White House. But Barr doesn’t mention privileged material as among his four categories of planned redactions and it does appear that as of now the White House isn’t getting involved (though Trump could change his mind).Democrats’ rhetoric has tended to focus on demanding a release of the “full Mueller report” — something that is a nice slogan but very unlikely to actually happen — in particular Justice will fight tooth-and-nail against jeopardizing secretive sources and ongoing investigations. (Though Democrats havethat in response to congressional Republican requests last year DOJ handed over some Russia probe documents while Mueller’s investigation was still ongoing.)A nonbinding resolution that recently passed the House of Representatives unanimously doesn’t call for a full unredacted public release butit does ask for two thingThe public release of the Mueller report “except to the extent the public disclosure of any portion thereof is expressly prohibited by law”“The full release to Congress of any report”That latter point is an important distinction. Democrats are aware that the Justice Department has good reasons to redact some information for public release — though they obviously want to try and minimize those reactions to only essential topics.But Democrats also say they want members of Congress to be able to review the unredactereport for themselves in a private setting. “The Department should not be able to simply invoke the same reasons for redacting the report from public view as a shield against disclosure to a coequal branch of government” Democrats wrote ina letter to Barr MondaBarr has currently made no offers to let them do any such thing. So far his two letters have spoken only about releasing a (redacted) Mueller report to both Congress and the public — he has shown no willingness to let Congress see more in private. If Democrats keep pushing on the matter that could be a potential compromise. One possible concern here is that Congress is very leaky so perhaps the full report could be restricted to a select bipartisan group.For now there’s no deal. Nadler’s Judiciary Committee voted to authorize subpoenas on Wednesday. But that doesn’t mean they’re issuing a subpoena just yet —they still “hope to avoid resort to compulsory process.” For now this seems to be an attempt at negotiation  an effort to get leverage in hopes of reaching a compromise.In any case a congressional subpoena to get the Mueller report might sound dramatic but it would also likely lead to a murky legal battle that could last years and go up to the Supreme Court. So Democrats would surely prefer to reach a deal with Barr now. But they also want to make clear that if they think he is trying to hide important information this is a legal fight they’re willing to have.Special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation: news and latest updateWhat we know about Mueller’s case against Trump on obstruction of justicHouse Judiciary committee authorizes subpoenas for full Mueller reporDid the media botch the Russia story?

So you rent yourself to your employer mix your labor with the tools they own and the efforts of the other people they hire and in return you receive a wage to buy the things you need to survive. This is called wage labor.Today almost everyone would agree that extreme forms of exploitation like slavery or the feudal system should be prohibited. In 50 years we’ll see that the wage-labor we have today is in fact an unacceptable form of exploitation too — and that we have alternative ways of structuring work.The power imbalances are obvious when you enter into your employment contract. Though your boss needs workers they need you as an individual employee less than you need grocery money. But that doesn’t mean that the arrangement isn’t mutually beneficial. Better to be exploited in a capitalist society than unemployed and destitute.Under feudalism it’s clear that a lord is exploiting a peasant — the peasant is doing all of the labor. Capitalism complicates matters: Capitalists contribute to production as managers and conveners of labor and their efforts are necessary to create new places of work. And crucially capitalists themselves are hostage to the market. If they tried to behave any differently they would be undercut by less benevolent competitors.The capitalist system has created a world of tremendous abundance. It’s also uprooted communities and caused massive environmental destruction. But now we finally have the tools to organize society on a different basis. Most of us are socially gathered into groups of workers who we collectively labor with already and we workers know at all levels of design production and delivery how to make the things society needs. workers would control their own workplaces. They could elect their managers and hold them accountable as well as shape firm decisions. Instead of a wage decided by the boss workers would become real stakeholders that receive a share of profits. These organizations would pay a tax on capital assets (the building the land it’s one machinery etc) in effect renting it from society as a whole. Funds from this tax would be used to fund new firms and (along with an income tax) a robust welfare state.Any advanced society will need a division of labor but that doesn’t mean work has to be as alienating as it is today. It’s no wonder that existing cooperatives — firms owned by the people who work there — today areThere would still be market competition and inefficient firms would still fail. But the penalty for worker-owners who “lose” in this competition could be getting a fresh start with the aid of a strong social safety net — a right to housing health care child care education and nutrition — not destitution.For the firms that do succeed the grow-or-die imperative doesn’t apply when the goal is no longer to maximize total profits but rather to maximize profit per worker. And instead of a race to the bottom there’s pressure to make sure janitorial and other jobs once seen as less desirable are well compensated. With the aid of active labor market policies and social supports we shouldn’t fear the automation of these roles either. This would be a social system that both materially and morally values all people.There may still be inequities in income inequities that can be mitigated through taxation and other measures. But there won’t be the same inequities in power. Everyone will be on equal footing in that we’ll have the same access to social goods and no one will be able to hire another person to labor for them — all work will be done in democratic workplaces or in an expanded public sector.It sounds fanciful but it’s not a year-zero leap into the unknown: It’s taking what we know works (universal social services and worker-owned cooperatives) and building a social system around them. In our new Gilded Age it’s an obvious alternative to a world where some live in lavish luxury but most never have their incredible human potential — to create and leave lasting legacies — nurtured and celebrated.Hindsight 2070: We asked 15 experts “What do we do now that will be considered unthinkable in 50 years?” Here’s what they told us.Check out our status page for more details.,1
What the Bernie Sanders 2020 Campaign Means for Progressives | Freepress.orWhat the Bernie Sanders 2020 Campaign Means for ProgressivePresidential candidate Kamala Harris began this week in the nation’s first primary state by proclaiming what she isn’t. “The people of New Hampshire will tell me what’s required to compete in New Hampshire” she “but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist.”Harris continued: “I believe that what voters do want is they want to know that whoever is going to lead understands that in America today not everyone has an equal opportunity and access to a path to success and that has been building up over decades and we've got to correct course.”Last summer another senator now running for the Democratic presidential nomination Elizabeth Warren went out of her way to proclaim what she is. Speaking to the New England Council on July 16 she: “I am a capitalist to my bones.”in a CNBC interview: “I am a capitalist. Come on. I believe in markets. What I don't believe in is theft what I don't believe in is cheating. That's where the difference is. I love what markets can do I love what functioning economies can do. They are what make us rich they are what create opportunity. But only fair markets markets with rules. Markets without rules is about the rich take it all it's about the powerful get all of it. And that's what's gone wrong in America.”In the obvious contrasts with Harris and in the less obvious yetwith Warren on matters of economic justice as well as Bernie Sanders represents a different approach to the root causes of -- and possible solutions to -- extreme economic inequality systemic injustice and a dire shortage of democracy.It’s not mere happenstance that Bernie is willing to use the word “oligarchy” to describe the current social order in the United States. What’s more he pointedly ties his candid analysis of reality to more far-reaching -- and potentially effective -- solutions.Now that Bernie has announced he’s running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination progressives will need to decide on how to approach the contest. Anyone with feet on the ground understands that the Democratic nominee will be the necessary means to achieve the imperative of preventing a Republican from winning another four years in the White House. So who is our first choice -- whose campaign deserves strong support -- to be the nominee of a Democratic Party that has remained chronicallyThe “tweak options” represented by Sen. Harris recycle the kind of mild populist rhetoric that served the presidential aspirations of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama so well. Corporate interests backed them from the outset and corporate interests benefited. Overall Wall Street soared while Main Street got clobbered.The “regulatory options” represented by Sen. Warren would be a positive departure for the top of the Democratic Party. Yet the constrained analysis (markets “are what make us rich they are what create opportunity”) puts forward constrained remedies more palliative than cure.The tweak options are fully compatible with further consolidation of the reign of corporate power that has enthroned oligarchy in the United States.Strong regulatory options if implemented could roll back some excesses of corporate power and that would certainly be progress. But we live in a world where mere plodding progress won’t be enough to halt catastrophic trends.The concentration of wealth in fewer and fewer hands is directly related to more and more disastrous momentum from vast. For those who want the next president to fight for solutions that match the scale of such problems the choice should be clear.One of the most exciting aspects of the upcoming Bernie campaign is the enormous potential for synergies with social movements. There are bound to be tensions -- that's inherent in the somewhat divergent terrains of seriously running for office and building movements -- but the opportunities for historic breakthroughs are right in front of us.Meanwhile corporate media outlets are poised to be even more negative toward the Bernie campaign than they were. This time independent progressive media outlets -- especially online -- will be vital and could prove to be decisive.The only real hope for the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign is that a grassroots uprising will become powerful enough to overcome the massive obstacles. It’s a huge cooperative task but success is possible.,1
The Roots of Russiagate in Aaron Burr’s “Treason” | Freepress.orThe Roots of Russiagate in Aaron Burr’s “Treason”The progressive liberal Democratic-Republican hero was supposed to be handed the presidency in 1800 and instead there was a tie.Somebody was going to have to pay. And the proper payment would be a charge of treason.We know that Thomas Jefferson was a progressive liberal because he said really nice things. He also enslaved and whipped and raped. He invented claims of white racist superiority to prove that all men were not created equal — claims that inspire fascist visitors to Charlottesville to this day. He invented the right of slave states to “nullify” federal law not to mention being the principal creator of our beloved two-party system.It was Jefferson’s presidency. He had waited for it. It was his turn now. And that blasted Aaron Burr had exactly as many votes as he had. First this would have to be fixed. Then Burr would have to be punished.Jefferson was at a disadvantage. He had no CIA no MSNBC. He was lacking a whole alphabet soup of modern tools and implements. But if the tale told in Jennifer Van Bergen’s new book is right Jefferson nonetheless found a way to exact his revenge. The book is calledMalice: Thomas Jefferson’s Conspiracy to Destroy Aaron Bur. Somehow Jefferson came up with every ingredient right down to ridiculous forged documents and dossiers.Russiagate is a case of projection distraction and reckless foreign endangerment. It began with WikiLeaks revealing Democratic Party emails that agreed with what was already plain: the Democratic Party had rigged its primary election. Russia and Donald Trump were blamed for providing this public service accused of rigging the election by revealing rigging of the election. This story was so much more enjoyable than the first one that it simply replaced it. The result was the Doomsday Clock ticking closer to midnight than ever.The Aaron Burr affair was a case of projection distraction and reckless foreign endangerment. Jefferson had backed expeditions into Spanish territory. The Freeman/Custis Red River expedition nearly started a war with Spain. The Neutrality Act that Jefferson accused Burr of violating had resulted from illegal expeditions that Jefferson had encouraged and sponsored. Jefferson blamed Burr for what he himself had done. The false story replaced the real one. The result was increased hostility and militarism. A giant treason scandal was created. The only trouble was that Burr was acquitted and the charges against him found to be fraudulent. The anti-climax of the Mueller Report is not without precedent.Yet everybody remembers Burr as vaguely treasonous just as many a U.S. resident who has owned a television during the past three years will imagine some sort of Putin-Trump deal. Jefferson and Hillary Clinton will be recalled as our true and rightful leaders.In reality Trump has evicted Russian diplomats sanctioned Russian officials put missiles on Russia’s border sent weapons into Ukraine lobbied European nations to drop Russian energy deals left the Iran agreement torn up the INF Treaty rejected Russia’s offers on banning weapons in space and banning cyber war expanded NATO eastward added a NATO partner in Colombia proposed adding Brazil demanded and successfully moved most NATO members to buy significantly more weapons splurged on more nukes bombed Russians in Syria overseen the largest war rehearsals in Europe in half a century condemned all proposals for a European military and insisted that Europe stick with NATO. Can one imagine a worse candidate about which to fantasize servitude to Vladimir Putin?If Van Bergen is right Burr was the least likely person on earth to charge with having done the sort of things Jefferson did. Jefferson declared Burr guilty just as if he were Barack Obama talking about Chelsea Manning pre-trial. If Van Bergen is right Jefferson worked long and hard at his failed effort to have Burr hanged. I’m sure this example will serve as a guiding light for many a falsely concocted outrage to come.,1
Congress Should Begin Impeachment But Not the Way You Think | Freepress.orCongress Should Begin Impeachment But Not the Way You ThinBack before Donald Trump was inaugurated I wrote ancalled “Fantasies About Russia Could Doom Opposition to Trump.” Perhaps it is less quixotic or perhaps it is more to hope that after more than two years of beingwith those fantasies but with their main focus having publicly more people will now be open to trying something else. That pre-inauguration article read:“Trump should be impeached on Day 1 but the same Democrats who found the one nominee who could lose to Trump will find the one argument for impeachment that can explode in their own faces. . . . Meanwhile we have a man planning to be president later this month whose business dealings clearly violate the U.S. Constitution in terms of not only foreign but alsocorruption. . . . Beyond that Trump is becoming president after election-day intimidation the partisan-based removal of voters from the rolls and opposition to attempting to count paper ballots where they existed. He’s arriving with the stated policies of unconstitutionally discriminating against Muslims murdering families stealing oil torturing and proliferating nuclear weapons. In other words Donald Trump will be from Day 1 an impeachable president and Democrats will have already spent months building their campaign around the one thing that won’t work. Imagine what will happen after all their hearings and press conferences when their supporters find out that they aren’t even accusing Vladimir Putin of hacking into election machines that in fact they are accusing unknown individuals of hacking into Democrats’ emails and that they are then vaguely speculating that those individuals could have been sources for WikiLeaks thereby informing the U.S. public of what was quite obvious and ought to have been widely reported for the good of the U.S. government namely that the DNC rigged its primary. By the time the Democrats beat themselves to the floor with this charade more facts will likely have come out regarding WikiLeaks’ actual source(s) and more hostility will likely have been stirred up with Russia. The war hawks have already got Trump talking up nuclear escalation.”On inauguration day RootsAction.org (which I work for) and Free Speech for People launched a petition to impeach Trump for his blatant violation of the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses of the U.S. Constitution which forbid any appearance or possibility of financial conflicts of interest. Very quickly over a million people added their support. This past January Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (Dem. Mich.) cosigned anwith Free Speech for People’s John Bonifaz that read:“We already have overwhelming evidence that the president has committed impeachable offenses including just to name a few: obstructing justice; violating the emoluments clause; abusing the pardon power; directing or seeking to direct law enforcement to prosecute political adversaries for improper purposes; advocating illegal violence and undermining equal protection of the laws; ordering the cruel and unconstitutional imprisonment of children and their families at the southern border; and conspiring to illegally influence the 2016 election through a series of hush money payments. Whether the president was directly involved in a conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere with the 2016 election remains the subject of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. But we do not need to wait on the outcome of that criminal investigation before moving forward. . . .”I asked Tlaib what she thought the top grounds for impeachment were and she named “three key areas where we already know the President has committed impeachable offenses: the Emoluments Clause (Trump Hotel) campaign finance violations (Cohen) and obstruction of justice (Firing Comey).”Tlaib has publicly committed to introducing articles of impeachment. But her position is extremely rare. Most members of Congress who have spoken of impeachment at all and most media outlets have for over two years insisted that Trump should be impeached if and only if the Mueller report proves that Trump worked with the Russian government to steal the 2016 election.Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler hastalk of impeachment “premature” and dependent onthat Trump’s payoffs to silence mistresses are impeachable offenses despite havingto “censure and condemn” Trump after Charlottesville and despite havingthe emoluments topic on which many havethat an overabundance of evidence is already public.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi hasthat she is opposed to impeaching Trump because doing so would be “divisive” and because the United States is “great” and not in any “perilous state” but would be if Trump had a second term.“Among the most damaging words to our democracy during the Trump era” RootsAction.org co-founder Jeff Cohen tells me “have been these six words: ‘Let’s wait for the Mueller report.’ That strategy of the Democratic leadership — and the obsessive Mueller coverage in allied outlets like MSNBC and CNN — has dangerously narrowed public attention to the not-yet-proven charge of Russian collusion while normalizing and marginalizing other more provable and impeachable Trump affronts to our Constitution. Imagine for example if even one-tenth of the attention lavished on Russiagate had been focused instead on Trump’s ongoing business corruption and his refusal to divest in the face of the Constitution’s requirement that a president not financially benefit from his office. While the public can readily understand greed and self-interest exit polls in November showed few voters were moved by the Russia collusion issue. The ‘waiting for Mueller’ strategy has made little sense politically or Constitutionally — and has pushed other Trump offenses to the impeachment sidelines: Muslim ban racist incitement infringements on the press politicizing prosecutions etc.”One of the more curious aspects in the long-awaited collapse of the Mueller effort to prove that Trump and Russia stole or tried to steal an election is that most voices in the corporate media have spoken for years both of the need to investigate that possibility and of the supposedly already established fact. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar on Saturday March 23rd sent out an email reading “There is overwhelming evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to help his presidential campaign win in 2016. Robert Mueller has been working to investigate the collusion and now that his report has been finalized it must be made public to the American people. Mueller’s report on Russian interference in our 2016 election and its findings impact the very foundation of our democracy. Our elections are supposed to be by the people for the people — with zero interference from foreign powers.”The evidence is so overwhelming that it is never actually cited and more of it is desperately needed.Public opinion has moved toward the more-evidence-is-needed view. Support for Trump’s impeachmenthalf the country and three-quarters of Democrats last summerhis approval rating and topping where it was prior to Congressional action for Richard Nixon and of course for Bill Clinton (whose impeachment was never popular) and almost reaching where it was for George W. Bush. But support haswith the fizzling out of the Mueller investigation and with Pelosi’s statements opposing impeachment. Sadly and predictably the new Cold War has not seen a similar reduction. Military spending is soaring and the head of NATO has been invited to speak to a joint session of Congress on April 3rd.18 draft articles of impeachment but they have thus far been drowned out by Russiagate. Has the focus on a non-Congressional investigation of Russia/WikiLeaks-related charges been helpful or harmful? I’ve found very few eager to answer that question. “We don’t have anything to add to this story” Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s communications person told me in a comment typical of a number of Congress members. Journalist and author of John Nichols told me “Every investigation has value. But I believe the most important investigations focus on Trump’s obstruction of justice as president and on his glaring disregard for the emoluments clause. The president’s financial deeds and misdeeds have to my mind always been the richest vein for exploration.”Journalist and radio host Glen Ford told me “The ‘investigations’ — if the term is even applicable — have proven that Donald Trump is a sleazy businessman who cares nothing for the law and surrounds himself with hustlers of his own low moral and ethical standards. Capitalism has gotten another black eye which is good. However after more than two years of trying the probes have utterly failed to prove the ‘predicate’ offense that ‘Russians’ hacked the DNC emails and gave them to Wikileaks. We must all now conclude that the charge is false — which is cause to open a new investigation into the collusion between the Democratic Party the CIA and the FBI and various other actors to foment war hysteria against nuclear-armed Russia and political mayhem at home under false and criminally contrived pretexts. I think this qualifies as a crime against peace under Nuremberg standards.”Beyond the desire to investigate those who instigated Russiagate and the need to address numerous other crises the movement for Trump’s impeachment is also now up against the marathon election season — which along with unverifiable vote counting gerrymandering the electoral college a system of legalized bribery biased debates corrupt media registration and ID hurdles the stripping of names from rolls and open intimidation is an actual flaw in past U.S. elections.If that weren’t enough impeachment must overcome the dread of Mike Pence. Author and professor Noam Chomsky tells me “The top ground for getting rid of Trump is that he is carrying out policies designed to undermine the prospects for organized human life in the near future and is doing so consciously — he understands the effects of global warming very well as he and his administration have demonstrated. Whether this is grounds for impeachment can be argued but it would do not good because it would bring in Pence who is as bad or maybe even worse because unlike Trump he is a ‘true believer’ and if God tells him to proceed to destroy so be it.”Would it do no good? As opponents of impeachment are also very fond of pointing out winning a conviction in the Senate would require a major transformation of U.S. politics — the sort of transformation that televised impeachment hearings could bring about the sort of transformation that could leave a President Pence weaker than a President Gerald Ford and wary of facing his own impeachment. Yet rather than highlighting the existing facts or producing new ones such as Trump’s tax returns Committee Chairs arethat Trump is refusing their requests for documents. An impeachment inquiry would produce those documents or new articles of impeachment for each subpoena not complied with.I asked Congresswoman Tlaib if she expects the White House will comply with Congressional subpoenas if the President believes he will not be impeached. She replied: “They have not yet.”There is also the option ofPence first. Early in the Bush-Cheney era I met with several Congress Members and impeachment activists to brainstorm. Congresswoman Maxine Waters proposed impeaching Dick Cheney first. The idea was generally welcomed. But Congresswoman Barbara Lee stopped everyone by insisting that Congressman John Conyers would need to approve. Conyers followed the wishes of Pelosi who has consistently opposed impeachment for Bush Cheney Kavanaugh and Trump.Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced articles of impeachment against both Bush and Cheney including 35 articles against Bush that I had led a team of experts in drafting. But much of the Democratic Caucus and Judiciary Chair Conyers refused to budge.What if the House had impeached Bush or Cheney and the Senate failed to convict? We can’t answer that with certainty but we do know what the failure to impeach them led to what the failure to impeach Reagan for Iran-Contra led to and what failure to impeach Trump is likely to lead to.John Nichols thinks we should consult a better understanding of history. “We have never removed a president at the conclusion of an impeachment process” he tells me. “We have had a president resign when faced with the prospect of removal. And the simple threat of hearings — usually coming in the context of a broader outcry — has caused presidents to alter policies and I believe rethink prospective reelection runs. By any measure hearings in and of themselves have the potential to constrain and conclude a lawless presidency. More importantly hearings set a standard for when and how future presidents can be called to account. Hearings are to my mind essential to addressing the high crimes and misdemeanors of the sitting president AND to setting the standards that might prevent future presidents from committing high crimes and misdemeanors.”Congresswoman Tlaib told me that she doubted an impeachment effort would lead to Trump complying with the law including the Constitution’s emoluments clauses but that “as important is putting any future CEO who wants to become president of the United States on notice that he/she won’t get away with direct conflicts of interests and violations to Constitutional clauses without Congress investigating and holding all those involved accountable.”,1
Reinventing Beto: How a GOP Accessory Became a Top Democratic Contender for President | Freepress.orReinventing Beto: How a GOP Accessory Became a Top Democratic Contender for PresidenTo understand Beto O’Rourke as a candidate it’s vital to go beneath the surface of his political backstory. News watchers are already well aware of the former Texas congressman’s good looks charisma youthful energy and fundraising prowess. But most remain unaware of an inconvenient truth that could undermine the O’Rourke campaign among the people who matter most -- the ones who’ll be voting to choose the Democratic presidential nominee next year.O’Rourke is hardly eager for those upcoming voters to realize that the growth of his political career is rooted in an alliance with powerful Republicans that began 15 years ago. Or that he supported raising the minimum age for Social Security in 2012. Or that -- during six years in Congress through the end of 2018 -- he often aligned himself with Republican positions.If facts matter such weighty facts could sink the “Beto for America” presidential campaign. Since his announcement information gaining traction nationwide runs directly counter to the Beto brand.“Before becoming a rising star in the Democratic Party” thea week ago “Beto O’Rourke relied on a core group of business-minded Republicans in his Texas hometown to launch and sustain his political career. To win their backing Mr. O’Rourke opposed Obamacare voted against Nancy Pelosi as the House Democratic leader and called for a raise in the Social Security eligibility age.”-- under the headline “Beto O’Rourke’s Political Career Drew on Donations From the Pro-Republican Business Establishment” -- also foreshadowed a bumpy ride on the campaign trail. In the eyes of most people who don’t like the GOP key points in the’s reporting are apt to be concerning. For instance:**  “Several of El Paso’s richest business moguls donated to and raised money for O’Rourke’s city council campaigns drawn to his support for a plan to redevelop El Paso’s poorer neighborhoods. Some later backed a super PAC that would play a key role in helping him defeat an incumbent Democratic congressman.”**  “O’Rourke worked on issues that had the potential to make money for some of his benefactors. His support as a council member for the redevelopment plan which sparked controversy at the time because it involved relocating low-income residents many of them Hispanic coincided with property investments by some of his benefactors.”**  “As a congressman he supported a $2 billion military funding increase that benefited a company controlled by another major donor. That donor real estate developer Woody Hunt was friends with O’Rourke’s late father. Hunt also co-founded and funds an El Paso nonprofit organization that has employed O’Rourke’s wife since 2016.”Central features of Trumpism are budgets that add billions to already-bloated Pentagon spending while cutting essential programs. In Beto’s last year in Congress whennearly one-third of House Democrats opposethe record-breaking 2019 National Defense Authorization Act of $717 billion Beto voted with Trump. (Four senators who are running against O’Rourke: Kirsten Gillibrand Kamala Harris Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.) “in contrast to the aspirational image he has fostered in recent years” O’Rourke’s political career has gone along a path of “winning support from a typically pro-GOP business establishment interested in swaying public policy. Born into one politically potent family and married into another he benefited repeatedly from his relationships with El Paso’s most powerful residents including several nationally known Republican moneymen.”To put his more conservative actions in context O’Rourke cannot plausibly claim that he was striving to be in sync with the voters who elected him. El Paso and the House district that O’Rourke represented are heavily Democratic. Thethis way: “In a one-party town -- the Democrats have held El Paso’s congressional seat for all but one term since 1902 -- local Republicans viewed Mr. O’Rourke as one of their own.”Naturally O’Rourke would much rather talk in upbeat generalities than answer pointed questions about why anti-Republican voters should cast ballots for him -- when he has a long record of going along with many GOP positions they find abhorrent. It may be better for him if unflattering coverage fixates instead on matters like youthful stints as a punk rocker andIt was just seven years ago when -- during his first run for Congress -- O’Rourke did a campaign video to tell people in the blue West Texas district that “we’ll have to look at future generations . . . retiring at a later age paying a greater percentage of their income into Social Security and making other necessary adjustments.” And thereports “in a candidate questionnaire published two days before the May 2012 primary Mr. O’Rourke called for raising the Social Security eligibility age and means-testing federal entitlements.” According to exit polling O’Rourke won that election with major help from Republicans who opted to vote in the Democratic primary and cast their ballots for him by a ratio ofAfter becoming a congressman O’Rourke backtracked and as “co-sponsored legislation that would increase Social Security benefits -- without raising the retirement age.” Yet hison Social Security in this decade is a warning flag.O’Rourke affinity with Republican sensibilities related to corporate power has continued. So has largesse from interests that are the antithesis of progressive values. Notably for his final term Beto retired from the House as the member of Congress who was theof campaign cash from the oil and gas industry.In June 2015 O’Rourke was one of-- out of 188 members of the party in the House -- who voted to give President Obama the power to negotiate the corporate-oriented Trans-Pacific Partnership. The measure squeaked through the House propelled by support from 190 Republicans.A year later the TPP was a highly visible and contentious issue at the 2016 Democratic National Convention where hundreds of Bernie Sanders delegates held anti-TPP signs. (I was one of those delegates and still support Sanders.) These days O’Rourke isaiming to have it both ways asreported in a campaign kickofflast week: “O’Rourke now says he would have voted ‘no’ on the ultimate agreement. But in 2015 he traveled with Obama on a trip to Asia to help build support for the deal.”At the end of last year thepublished an exhaustively researched article under the headline “Beto O’Rourke Frequently Voted for Republican Legislation Analysis Reveal.” The piece reported that “even as O’Rourke represented one of the most solidly Democratic congressional districts in the United States he has frequently voted against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills andWritten by investigative journalist David Sirota (who days ago joined the Sanders presidential campaign as a speechwriter) the Dec. 20 article reviewed “the 167 votes O’Rourke has cast in the House in opposition to the majority of his own party during his six-year tenure in Congress. Many of those votes were not progressive dissents alongside other left-leaning lawmakers but instead votes to help pass Republican-sponsored legislation.”A cautionary tale comes from David Romo an activist and historian in El Paso who describesBeto O’Rourke as a “masterful politician. . . It’s all fluff it’s all style it’s all looks.” Romo clashed with City Councilman O’Rourke when hefor redevelopment that would enrich some of his wealthy backers. Romorecently: “O’Rourke because of his charisma can kind of pull off some of this behind-the-scenes power peddling. He was the pretty face in the really ugly gentrification plan that negatively affected the most vulnerable people in El Paso.”To the casual listener however O’Rourke might sound lovely. Considerfrom the presidential campaign trail: “We want to be for everybody work with everybody. Could care less about your party affiliation or any other difference that might otherwise divide us at this moment of truth where I really feel we will either make or break this great country and our democracy.”From O’Rourke that kind of talk has sometimes overlapped with disinterest in defeating Republicans. Last year while running for the Senate O’Rourke helped a friend in need -- Texas GOP Congressman Will Hurd -- by notably refusing to endorse his Democratic opponent.  Gina Ortiz Jones a gay Filipina-American had momentum in a district with a majority of Hispanics. But O’Rourke’s solidarity with his Republican colleague may well have saved Hurd’s seat.Hurd won re-election by under one-half of a percentage point while O’Rourke won in the district by a five-point margin. As the O’Rourke “had elevated” his Republican colleague Hurd “with frequent praise and most memorably a live-streamed bipartisan road trip that helped jump-start their midterm campaigns.” During the campaign O’Rourke tried to justify his refusal to endorse Hurd’s Democratic opponent by declaring: “This is a place where my politics and my job and my commitment to this country come into conflict. I’m going to put country over party.”asked O’Rourke late last year whether he considered himself to be a progressive Democrat O’Rourke: “I don’t know. I’m just as you may have seen and heard over the course of the campaign I’m not big on labels. I don’t get all fired up about party or classifying or defining people based on a label or a group. I’m for everyone.”After O’Rourke campaigned in the Detroit area a few days ago theinformation that would concern anyone with minimally progressive leanings: “He supported Republican efforts toof the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which was established by Obama and Democrats to protect Americans from Wall Street following the recession. O’Rourke also broke with the party to support Trump and GOP attempts to loosen requirements in hiring border patrol agents;at the Affordable Care Act; killon oil drilling in parts of the Gulf of Mexico; and lift the 40-year-old oil export ban. He alsothat protected utility companies that start wildfires.”It’s understandable that many progressives came out of 2018 with a favorable view of O’Rourke. He ran a strong campaign that got remarkably close to unseating the odious Sen. Ted Cruz. Along the way O’Rourke showed himself to be eloquent and tireless. Some of his stances are both enlightened and longstanding as with his advocacy for legalizing marijuana. And O’Rourke provided some stunning moments of oratory as in a viralthat showed his response to a question about NFL players kneeling in protest during the national anthem; his support for dissent in the context of civil rights history was exemplary.Yet overall there’s a good reason why O’Rourke declines to call himself “progressive.” He isn’t. His alliances and sensibilities when you strip away some cultural affinities and limited social-justice positions are bedrock corporate.In his quest for a Democratic nomination that will require support from a primary electorate that leans progressive Beto O’Rourke will be running to elude his actual record. If it catches up with him he’s going to lose.,1
The Sins of Ilhan Omar Start With Challenging Rigid Orthodoxy | Freepress.orThe Sins of Ilhan Omar Start With Challenging Rigid OrthodoxDemocrats have gone all atwitter (pun intended) scattering ruffled feathers all over the barnyard as if a fox were after them when the only serious threat to their blinkered preconceptions comes from a bird of different plumage. Not all Democrats are squawking like chickens with their heads cut off (as it were) but enough of the older backward-looking birds are making enough noise to make the whole party look idiotic.In plainer language the Democratic Party remains in the grip of white privilege which can only be a losing position in a country where there’s no effective challenge to Trump for the white supremacy vote. Want proof? Nominate Biden. But that’s only a prediction. What’s going on right now in the House of Representatives is reprehensible enough as reflexive ideologues swarm to block the smallest whiff of any fresh air.The demonization of Rep. Ilhan Omar is a hari-kari move for the party led by people dug in against almost any real change doing as little as possible about all the actual crises. Demonizing a forthright congresswoman from Minnesota who came to this country as a 12-year-old refugee from Somalia is reactionary mindless unjustified and fundamentally stupid. Stupid? Yes stupid because it helps Republicans inflame division among Democrats with no offsetting gain. The American role in Somalia has been destructive for decades but who’s thinking about apologizing for that?As this is written the state of play is that a minority of old-line Democrats want a nonbinding resolution condemning anti-Semitism but only their figment of anti-Semitism as imagined in a handful of remarks by Ilhan Omar. There has been enough pushback from others in the party that there’s no agreement on whether the resolution might also condemn Islamaphobia. So far no one’s much suggesting adding any of the many other bigotries to the resolution which is pretty weird if you stop to think about it. Basically the resolution pretends to be all about anti-Semitism which is abhorrent but the overall reaction kind of illustrates Ilhan Omar’s point in the first place: it’s all about Israel.Or more to the point it’s all about saying nothing bad about Israel which is straightforward political censorship. Coming in the wake of the UN Human Rights Council reportthat Israeli soldiers likely committed war crimeby killing 189 unarmed civilians in Gaza during 2018 the freakout over Ilhan Omar looks like a very convenient and cynical distraction.So what is the case against Ilhan Omar? There are a variety of alleged “smoking guns” claimed against Omar all of which on close examination shoot blanks. The one that touched off the current rush to misjudgment was a short simple tweet on February 10 2018 here in its entirety:“It’s all about the Benjamins baby” [musical-notes emoji]This is obviously a quote from a Puff Daddy song (on the album “No Way Out” 1997) that’s what the musical notes mean. The quote is about as anti-Semitic as saying “Money makes the world go ‘round.” It’s not anti-Semitic it’s just true in a pretty obvious and superficial way. It’s also a truth widely subjected to political denial.And is there anyone out there who isn’t aware that a Republican-dominated Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case opened the floodgates to the money-corruption of American politics we suffer from today? Ilhan Omar spoke the truth a small truth to be sure but the truth all the same.So what about the context? Maybe that helps. Ilhan Omar’s tweet was in response to atweet from journalist Glenn GreenwalGreenwald based his tweet on areport saying just that in Haaret. McCarthy even equated the two women with serial racist Republican Steve King about whom McCarthy never felt the need to do anything. McCarthy’s promise of “action” against the two Muslim women was clearly an empty threat from a minority party leader. Then Democrats panicked took the bait and created an irresponsible hysteria-storm that really is a witch-hunt. So it looks like the Democratic knee-jerkers got played badly played by a corrupt Republican whose interest in bigotry is only self-serving. Or have we forgotten all the times McCarthy has called out the president on his racist tropes of all sorts?In any event Ilhan Omarresponded in a mature and straightforward mannein a tweet at 2:46 p.m. the following day:In a rational where people operated in good faith none of what Ilhan Omar said would have provoked much disagreement never mind the irrational ritual scapegoating that erupted. Thedeeper context for this flare-uwas much nastier as reported by Sheryl Gay Stolberg in The New York Times on February 1 referring to Ilhan Omar and Rashida Talib:their uncompromising views on Israel have made them perhaps the most embattled new members of the Democratic House majority. Almost daily Republicans brashly accuse Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Omar of anti-Semitism and bigotry hoping to make them the Democrats’ version of Representative Steve King as they try to tar the entire Democratic Party with their criticism of the Jewish state.Referring to “their uncompromising views on Israel” as if that were unquestioned fact – and by definition reprehensible – not only highlights the bias of the writer but works to foreclose any discussion of Israel in anything like an objective manner which would necessarily include both the crimes of the state and the crimes of the prime minister. As the Times sort of predicted the viciously bigoted Republican Party laid a trap for the Democrats and lacking judicious consideration they stumbled right into it.Why would they do something so stupid and self-destructive? One can only speculate. But why did the entire Democratic leadership in the House feel it was necessary to call out Ilhan Omar the same day she apologized? What is really going on? Does the tweet “It’s all about the Benjamins baby” really call for THIS kind of over-the-top response? Even the title is a little crazy: “Democratic Leadership Statement on Anti-Semitic Comments of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar” especially when not one “anti-Semitic comment” is cited.The statement itself is weird in other wayas well (here in its entirety from February 11 with no time stamp):Washington D.C. – Speaker Nancy Pelosi Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Majority Whip James E. Clyburn Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luján Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries and Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark issued this joint statement condemning anti-Semitic comments made over Twitter by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar:The first sentence is a hypocritical and self-approving falsehood. When was the last time the Democratic establishment called out any other anti-Semitism real or imagined? When was the last time the Democratic establishment made any effort to distinguish between anti-Semitism (bigotry against Jews) and anti-Israeli politics (where anti-Semitism is used as an epithet to quash any discussion of killing unarmed civilians or pick your issue)?When it comes to Israel American politics is largely coherence-free. Israel is the golden calf of American politics. Israel has long been a profoundly corrupting factor in American politics and American public discourse generally. No wonder the “Democratic Leadership” pledges eternal fealty to Israel – “We are and will always be strong supporters …” In other words kiss judgment goodbye. And to talk about “shared values” that would include an illegal occupation killing civilians torturing prisoners – well maybe the Democratic leaders feel those really are shared values.The hollow fatuity of the dishonest last paragraph would be stunning if such hypocrisy hadn’t been rampant for so long. Of course the sentiment expressed is unexceptionable but it’s way more honored in the breach than the observance. Stampeding into Islamaphobia makes the objection to anti-Semitism ring hollow. Ritual humiliation is or should be intolerable. Especially when it’s in the same room with you. But it’s not. Remember the Michael Cohen hearings on February 27? Remember Republican Mark Meadows using a black woman as a hand puppet in defense of Trump? Remember who objected? The most forceful objection came from Rep. Rashida Tlaib causing a minor ruckus in which Rep. Elijah Cummings came to her rescue.Rashida Tlaib never should have been a target. Rashida Tlaib objected to manifestly objectionable behavior behavior that wasn’t just racist wasn’t just demeaning to women but was despicable in every aspect. Rep. Meadows was arguing that Trump couldn’t be a racist because he has a black employee which should have been laughed down from the start. But it wasn’t Meadows was allowed to ask this black woman – whom he had summoned to the hearing on his own authority – to stand behind him while he told the world what she thought. She was his muted hand-puppet in a disgraceful abuse of human dignity.And no one objected at the time. None of the Democrats who are white men had any objection. None of the Democrats who are white women had any objection not even on gender grounds. The only Democrats who made any objection were women of color. The only Democrats who offered any defense of simple human dignity were women of color. And that’s where the Democratic Party is these days divided among the old guard mostly white which acts like its psychically numb and newer younger Democrats of all hues who have some vision of a future that would be dramatically better for most of us.Old guard Democrats retain a perhaps tenuous control of the party but to get to any kind of future worth having that old guard will have to do some serious soul-searching. And they will have to find a soul.Shortly after this story was filed the House passed H. RES. 183 a seven-page resolution with this preamble:Condemning anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values and aspirations that define the people of the United States and condemning anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities as hateful expressions of intolerance that are contrary to the values and aspirations of the United States.The vote was 407 to 23 with all 235 Democrats and 173 Republicans in favor. All the No votes were Republicans. Republican Steve King voted present.The Resolution is an incoherent hodgepodge with little meaning beyond the cliché of “be nice to each other.” Interestingly it notes that hate crimes against Jews were up 37% in 2017 and that hate crimes against Muslims were up 99% from 2014 to 2016. The first item in the resolution is to reject “the pernicious myth of dual loyalty ...” even though that’s what the Democratic leadership essentially expressed. There is no language defending free speech especially asnoted no language to the effect that “Criticism of Israel cannot be equated with anti-Semitism.” Rabbi Alissa Wise of Jewish Voice for Peace reaffirmed that “valid criticisms of Netanyahu AIPAC and Israel’s mistreatment of Palestinians are being falsely attacked as anti-Semitism.” Of course this happens all the time as a crudely effective means of shutting down debate. Or enforcing dual loyalty? For all that this resolution is largely unobjectionable it also lacks honesty and integrity. It has no soul.],1
Socialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Women’s Day | ColumbusFreePress.coSocialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Women’s Dacoalition and allies from Columbus decided to send Ohio Governor Mike DeWine a message for International Women’s Day. A dozen women and men attempted to access DeWine’s upper-floor office at the Columbus Riffe Center.After being turned away they went to the ground floor lobby and held a. “Our bodies our choice!” they chanted. “Governor DeWine abortion’s not a crime!”The protesters were targeting Ohio Senate Bill 23 the so-called “heartbeat bill” which would ban abortions six weeks after conception. DeWine has pledged to sign the bill if it’s passed by the Ohio legislature.When the lobby closed at 5 PM State Highway Patrol officers ordered the demonstrators to leave. Depending on their level of resistance they were escorted dragged or carried out of the building. There were no arrests. Outside the protesters were joined by about 40 supporters and held a rally on the sidewalk.“In Kentucky a very similar bill is poised to become law very shortly” said Ashley Theissen a member of the International Socialist Organization. “Ohio SB 23 is still in committee. We have a lot of time to build a movement to stop it in its tracks.”Theissen doesn’t believe the abortion fight can be won at the ballot box. “For many years now the mainstream feminist groups have decided to take a tactic of electoral politics: donating to Democrats and hoping that things work out all right” she said. “We know by the state of Kentucky and now Ohio that this has not been an effective strategy.”Socialist feminists in Cincinnati want to build a coalition across Ohio to fight back against SB 23 Theissen said. “The only way that we can protect abortion access is to build a mass movement. It’s not going to be settled by getting a few more people in office who might be a little more sympathetic to our rights. When we Roe v. Wade was won Nixon was sitting in the White House and four Nixon appointees were sitting on the Supreme Court. Three of the four went with the majority decision. They voted for Roe v. Wade. The reason why is that a massive movement from below had forced their hand. They had no choice but to make abortion legal.”“Fuck the courts and legislature. Women are not incubators!” the crowd chanted.“The clear intention of the Ohio legislature is to pass a law that forces a Supreme Court case with the potential of overthrowing Roe v. Wade” said Socialist Alternative member Amanda Ponomarenko.  The 1973 ruling “has been the target of the religious right in this country for decades. They’ve been organizing with Republicans for years to pass laws restricting access to abortion. They’re emboldened by Trump’s presidency and celebrating his two Supreme Court appointments Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh who pose a real threat to Roe v. Wade and women’s reproductive health.”Ponomarenko linked reproductive rights to a broader social transformation. “We need to continue to bring #MeToo into the workplace in the struggle against harassment to demand the right to reproductive health care — including abortion — and universal child care. We need an end to for-profit health care and a Medicare for all system. We can fight for a federal $15 an hour minimum wage and affordable housing — the bare minimum necessities for working class families” she said.“For this change to last we’ll need to transform these struggles for reform into a fight for a radical shift in society — to a society based on human need and not on profit.”Bob Bites Back: The Columbus Way won’t worBreaking down the Columbus bond issues for the May 7th primary electioDeWine’s State of State Rhetoric Doesn’t Align with Ohio’s RecordSix week abortion ban passes SenatProtesters call for mass movement to #CancelKavanaugYoung feminists celebrate the revolutionary roots of International Women’s Da,1
Joe Biden on the Relaunch Pad: He’s Worse Than You Thought | Freepress.orJoe Biden on the Relaunch Pad: He’s Worse Than You Thoughfront-paged its latest anti-left polemic masquerading as a news article the March 9 piece declared: “Should former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. enter the race as his top advisers vow he soon will he would have the best immediate shot at the moderate mantle.”On the verge of relaunching Joe Biden is poised to come to the rescue of the corporate political establishment -- at a time when in the words of the “the sharp left turn in the Democratic Party and the rise of progressive presidential candidates are unnerving moderate Democrats.” After 36 years in the Senate and eight as vice president Biden is by far the most seasoned servant of corporate power with a prayer of becoming the next president.When Biden read this paragraph in a recent his ears must have been burning: “Early support from deep-pocketed financial executives could give Democrats seeking to break out of the pack an important fundraising boost. But any association with bankers also opens presidential hopefuls to sharp attacks from an ascendant left.”The direct prey of Biden’s five-decade “association with bankers” include millions of current and former college students now struggling under avalanches of debt; they can thank Biden for his prodigious services to the lending industry. Andrew Cockburn identifies an array of victims in hiof Biden in the March issue of**  “Biden was long a willing foot soldier in the campaign to emasculate laws allowing debtors relief from loans they cannot repay. As far back as 1978 he helped negotiate a deal rolling back bankruptcy protections for graduates with federal student loans and in 1984 worked to do the same for borrowers with loans for vocational schools.”**  “Even when the ostensible objective lay elsewhere such as drug-related crime Biden did not forget his banker friends. Thus the 1990 Crime Control Act with Biden as chief sponsor further limited debtors’ ability to take advantage of bankruptcy protections.”**  Biden worked diligently to strengthen the hand of credit-card firms against consumers. At the same time “the credit card giant MBNA was Biden’s largest contributor for much of his Senate career while also employing his son Hunter as an executive and later as a well-remunerated consultant.”Media mythology about “Lunch Bucket Joe” cannot stand up to scrutiny. His bona fides as a pal of working people are about as solid and believable as those of the last Democratic nominee for president.But Biden’s fealty to corporate power has been only one aspect of his many-faceted record that progressives will widely find repugnant to the extent they learn about it.Since the #MeToo movement began some retrospective media coverage has assessedin chairing the Clarence Thomas - Anita Hill hearings of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And in recent dayshas brought into focus his backstory of pandering to white racism against African-Americans during much of his Senate career.As a 32-year-old senator in 1975 Biden: “I do not buy the concept popular in the ’60s which said ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score we must now give the black man a head start or even hold the white man back to even the race.’ I don’t buy that.”More attention is also needed to Biden’s role as Judiciary Committee chair pushing through thelandmark 1994 crime bill. In the process of championing the bill Biden warned of “predators on our streets” during a 1993speech on the Senate floo“It doesn’t matter whether or not they were deprived as a youth” Biden proclaimed. “It doesn’t matter whether or not they had no background that enabled them to become socialized into the fabric of society. It doesn’t matter whether or not they’re the victims of society. The end result is they're about to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe shoot my sister beat up my wife take on my sons.”shows Biden and Bernie Sanders neck and neck in the first-in-the-nation contest for the nomination with the rest of the candidates far behind in the state. For quite a while Biden has been sharpening his hatchet to swing at progressive populism in general -- and Bernie in particular.In typical Biden style the former vice president is eager to stake out the middle of the road between ultra-predatory capitalism and solidarity with working-class people. At an October 2017 gathering in Alabama he: “Guys the wealthy are as patriotic as the poor. I know Bernie doesn’t like me saying that but they are.” Later Biden elaborated on the theme when hean audience at the Brookings Institution “I don’t think five hundred billionaires are the reason we’re in trouble. The folks at the top aren’t bad guys.”last summer “at a time when left-wing populism is increasingly accepted as the antidote to Trump and the GOP’s nativist and corporate-friendly pitch Biden stands as a remnant of precisely the sort of left-averse triangulating Democratic politics that Hillary Clinton was relentlessly criticized for personifying.”Biden makes clear his distaste for the current progressive populist wave. “I know some want to single out big corporations for all the blame” he wrote in a. “It is true that the balance has shifted too much in favor of corporations and against workers. But consumers workers and leaders have the power to hold every corporation to a higher standard not simply cast business as the enemy or let industry off the hook.”One of the many industries that Biden has a long record of letting “off the hook” is the war business. In that mode Biden did more than any other Democratic senator to greenlight the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.It wasn’t just that Biden voted for the Iraq war on the Senate floor five months before it began. During the lead-up to that vote in August 2002 as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee he presided over sham hearings -- refusing to allow experts who opposed an invasion to get any words in edgewise -- while a cavalcade of war hawks testified in the national spotlight.“It is difficult to over-estimate the critical role Biden played in making the tragedy of the Iraq war possible” Middle East studies professor Stephen Zunes. “More than two months prior to the 2002 war resolution even being introduced in what was widely interpreted as the first sign that Congress would endorse a U.S. invasion of Iraq Biden declared on August 4 that the United States was probably going to war. In his powerful position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he orchestrated a propaganda show designed to sell the war to skeptical colleagues and the America public by ensuring that dissenting voices would not get a fair hearing.”Joe Biden’s friendly TV persona appeals to many. He smiles well and has a gift of gab. Most political journalists in the mass media like him. He’s an apt frontrunner for the military-industry complex and the corporate power structure that it serves. Whether Biden can win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination will largely depend on how many voters don’t know much about his actual record.,1
The Big Obstacle for Bernie Isn’t DNC “Rigging” -- It’s Media Trashing | Freepress.orThe Big Obstacle for Bernie Isn’t DNC “Rigging” -- It’s Media TrashinSome people are attached to the idea that the Democratic National Committee will “rig” the presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders. The meme encourages the belief that the Bernie 2020 campaign is futile because of powerful corporate Democrats. But such fatalism should be discarded.As Frederick Douglass said “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.” Of course top Democratic Party officials don’t intend to give up control. It has to be taken from them. And the conditions for doing that are now more favorable than ever.The effects of mobilized demands for change in the Democratic presidential nominating process have been-- not out of the goodness of any power broker’s heart but because progressives have organized effectively during the last two years.“I think I will not shock anybody to suggest that the DNC was not quite evenhanded” during the 2016 race Bernielast week on CNN. “I think we have come a long way since then and I fully expect to be treated quite as well as anybody else.”One big factor: This time no candidate can gain frontrunner leverage with superdelegates the way Hillary Clinton did early in the race. Last August undersuperdelegates’ votes at the Democratic National Convention for the first ballot of the nominating process. There hasn’t been a second ballot since 1952.When timeworn polemics insist that what’s now underway can’t really happen it is time to revise the polemics. For many years we heard that genuinely progressive Democrats couldn’t make meaningful inroads in Congress. Now with impacts that far exceed their growing numbers recently arrived House members are doing a lot to help reshape the political discourse -- notably Pramila Jayapal Ro Khanna Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ilhan Omar Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.While ill-founded the line that “the DNC will rig 2020” is apt to have perverse impacts. No doubt sincerely believed by some the outdated notion serves to demoralize and de-energize.Is the Bernie 2020 campaign facing a steep uphill climb? Of course it is. Are powerful forces arrayed to crush it? Absolutely.But let’s be clear. The huge obstacle ahead is not the DNC -- it’s the mass media. The corporate-owned and corporate-advertiser-funded media of this country are the biggest barriers between Bernie Sanders and the Oval Office.Often functioning as propaganda outlets the major news media serve as an amplification system for corporate power that hasthe Democratic Party from the combined “threats” ofand progressive populist candidates. The synergies of momentum from the left -- outside and inside of electoral arenas -- are continuing to accelerate.It’s crucial that progressives develop more effective challenges to the media serving the predatory big-money system. More than any other forcereflexive spin from corporate medistands between us and a Bernie Sanders presidency.In sharp contrast to campaigns with enormous budgets for Astroturf the first Sanders presidential campaign was able to effectively defy the conventional wisdom and overall power structure by inspiring and mobilizing at the grassroots. His campaign was -- and is -- antithetical to the politics of corporate media.Two examples of news coverage exactly three years apart indicate what the Bernie 2020 campaign will be up against. In early March 2016 at a pivotal moment during the primary campaign FAIR analyst Adam Johnson“ran 16 negative stories on Bernie Sanders in 16 hours . . . a window that includes the crucial Democratic debate in Flint Michigan and the next morning’s spin.”Days ago when Bernie Sanders launched his campaign with a big rally in Brooklyn the MSNBC coverage was so slanted that anfrom Glenn Greenwald appeared under the headline “MSNBC Yet Again Broadcasts Blatant Lies This Time About Bernie Sanders’ Opening Speech and Refuses to Correct Them.”Greenwald’s critique of MSNBC focused on flagrantly inaccurate anti-Sanders commentary from a former Hillary Clinton aide that immediately followed the senator’s Brooklyn speech. No Sanders supporter was included in the discussion. The coverage prompted an email from FAIR founder (and my colleague) Jeff Cohen to an MSNBC vice president: “You have no trouble finding hardcore Clintonite Bernie-bashers; please offer some balance in your analysts. In today’s Democratic Party there’s clearly more sympathy for Bernie than the Clintons -- but not on MSNBC.”It’s worth noting that this owned by the world’s richest person Jeff Bezos while MSNBC is owned byComcast “the world’s largest entertainment company.”To counteract the media propaganda arsenal now in place we should fully recognize that arsenal as the main weaponry that corporate power will deploy against the Bernie 2020 campaign. We must confront those corporate media forces while vastly strengthening independent progressive media work of all kinds.,1
"Will Bernie Sanders Waste His Supporters' Money Again by Not Really Wanting to Win? | Freepress.orWill Bernie Sanders Waste His Supporters' Money Again by Not Really Wanting to Win?Clinton Campaigning illegally inside Massachusetts polling station during 2016 Democratic primary.Ok let's get one thing straight: Bernie Sanders was my kind of candidate but if he had really wanted to win in 2016 he would have challenged the primary election results ten ways to Sunday. In Massachusettsinside the polling wire glad-handing and back-slapping as Secretary of State William J. Galvin looked the other way merely issuing a ""reminder"" later to everyone that electioneering inside the wire was illegal.Later in Massachusetts it was discovered that Sanders had won by an average of 18% in towns where the paper ballots are counted by hand but lost by about 1.4% in towns where the ballots were counted by machine. Sanders supporters filed a lawsuit demanding to look at the paper ballots but ait down on procedural grounds.In California election officials ingot caught red-handed using white-out - yes white-out - on Sanders votes. It doesn't matter what the department gave for a reason. There should never be white-out in a vote-counting room. Never. Not once.And in Arizona thousands of voters waited in the hot sun and into the night to vote in the state's most populous county and many quit because they had to go back to work or mind kids. Maricopa County is where Phoenix is.All of this is summarized in""Yes Hillary Did Steal the Democratic Primary in 2016.""Don't get me wrong. I'm glad Bernie entered the race. But why run if you don't have the belly-fire for the big fight when it starts? Bernie certainly had it early in his career when he got dragged off by cops as he sat next to a Black woman demonstrating for her civil rights. In those days Bernie was really ""with her"" when someone needed to be.Bernie managed to say some of these episodes of cheating were but that isn't enough when the $27 you just gave him was the last you had that didn't go to bills or food. Announcing that you have ""observers"" and ""legal teams"" on stand-by and ready to rock is all well and good but what good are observers if they never do anything with their observations?Hard-ball politics means going to court in a heartbeat hold up do not pass go just what the hell is going on here your honor? Bernie had every grounds to ask a Massachusetts judge to invalidate the precincts where old Bill illegally crossed the polling wirefrom the entrance of the polling station in Massachusetts. He had every grounds to ask a New York judge to hold the primary all over again where at least 125000 voters inexplicably got wiped off the rolls or had their registrations otherwise f*&amp;ked with.Old Bernie owes his supporters an explanation. It is not academic. The very same people running the DNC primary election apparatus in 2016 will be running it in 2020. There is absolutely no reason to believe they will behave any better. In fact there is every reason to believe they will behave as badly or worse. In the intervening years election departments have hidden whatever can be hidden and a lot of things that shouldn't be by law. In Florida in 2017 Broward County Election Supervisor Brenda Snipes flat out burned -- every last paper ballot affecting a non-Democratic establishment primary candidate Tim Canova.Canova was suing to have his votes counted again afterspotted some mighty peculiar vote patterns in the voting data which suggested machine total tampering. Now Canova can never prove election fraud one way or the other which itself is evidence screaming of guilt for rigging the election for the establishment candidate Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.Florida state Judge Raag Singhal of the 17th Judicial Circuit Court held that Wasserman-Schultz ally Brenda Snipes -- ""illegally destroyed"" ballots which are required by federal law to be preserved for 22 months after an election. Judge Singhal also said:""defendant's lack of intent to destroy evidence while this case was pending is irrelevant.""Singhal affirmed that there was no question of fact that Snipes had engaged in a violation of federal statute punishable by up to a year in jail.In Cuyahoga County Ohio an election department attorney responded to my requests for the ballot images - digital images that are automatically taken of each ballot as it is run though the optical scan counting machine - with stonewalling and prevarication. An Ohio judge clearly ruled that the ballot images wereand therefore subject to Freedom of Information Act requests. The attitude of the Cuyahoga County election department is who cares.Sanders must come clean and come clean fast. People work too hard for their money for him to be thinking he will just influence the dialogue and not fight to win.One way for Bernie to start coming clean is to immediately announce his support for nationwide legislation requiring the option of voter hand-marked paper ballots either hand-counted or counted by a modern optical scan vote counting machine which takes digital images of the paper ballots. The digital images should posted publicly for recounting asAnother way for Bernie to come clean would be to join thefor law enforcement to enforce the law in the matter of former Broward County election supervisor Brenda Snipes who was fired by the governor before she could end her term in peace. Snipes now has the gall to contest her firing on the grounds that she is beingbecause she is Black although no one can show that illegally burning ballots is a standard practice even in Florida.Bernie Sanders has become the Berniewho wanted him to clog the courts with righteous lawsuits and demanding re-votes and re-counts where warranted: ""Brothers and sisters this is the real world.""We know that Bernie. And the real world sometimes demands a fight. What Tim Canova is doing that's what a fight looks like. It is not a question which pertains only to primaries. In the 2016 general electiondiscovered a strange and highly unlikely ""red shift"" pattern indicating possible election fraud in favor of Donald Trump though Ohio's 18 electoral votes would not have reversed the outcome.We want the old Bernie back. We want the Bernie who got dragged off by the cops when he stood by a Black woman.",1
The Democrats Have Nowhere to Go but Left | Freepress.orThe Democrats Have Nowhere to Go but LefThe Democratic Party has nowhere to go but left.The 2016 Sandernista groundswell and the Rainbow Tsunami of 2018 have marked a historic shift.The diverse wave of millennial activists that has poured into the Congress is unprecedented. And the public support for real change – a Green New Deal – is undeniable.The real message: the three-decade triangulation of the Clintonista New Democrats has been transcended.The faux mantra from bloviating experts petulant pundits and high-priced consultants has been droning on since the coming of Ronald Reagan: the Democrats must forever tack right to attract “swing” conservatives in the “mainstream middle” between the two parties.But in the Age of Trump such voters are all but extinct. The middle ground has cratered. The swing constituency (if it ever existed) has disappeared into the abyss. What matters now is excitement commitment clarity and REAL CHANGE ... none of which can come with a corporate/compromised agenda.Since the Great Society sank into the Vietnam quagmire the only major federal program meant to benefit the working/middle class has been Obamacare. The gap between rich and poor has become a bottomless pit. What matters now is substance. And it’s coming from the post-corporate left.The original New Deal is the ultimate historic role model. It put millions to work revived a crashed economy guaranteed food and education for the poor served the environment and gave the nation hope and real change.The New Frontier/Great Society established Medicare opened pathways to social justice and bottom-up prosperity and (until it sank in Vietnam) promised so much more.Now Sandernista/Millennials want a Green New Deal to take it all to a new level. The Green New Deal must replace our Earth-killing fossil/nuke burners with 100% renewables creating millions of jobs along the way. With that vital transition must come Medicare for All and answers for staggering medical debt massive student loans and soaring college tuition homelessness a swollen imperial budget and much much more. In time this of global crisis there’s no doubt about it:This Green New Deal is our essential route to ecological and economic survivaIt’s also the last hope of the Democratic Party. A deeply divided dangerously embittered nation can no longer tolerate political timidity.For a new generation of activists that means going inside/out.In the left lane it means maintaining the Green and other independent organizations for ideological clarity and an outside power base.Such campaigns demand no compromise. That means unflinching solidarity for ending the empire abolishing nuclear weapons and banning torture a ban on nuclear and fossil fuels converting quickly to 100% renewables and efficiency demanding mass transit solving homelessness protecting organic food banning GMOs winning universal health care abolishing student and medical debt protecting the right to vote universal hand-cast/hand-counted paper ballots getting money out of politics meaningful gun control full racial/gender/sexual preference equality and much more.All that demands a coordinated network of independent grassroots organizations and at least one true progressive political party completely free of all corporate influence.At the same time converting the historic Democratic Party to an organ of real social and ecological change remains essential. The 2016 Sandernista campaign made the party bend. In 2018 some real progressives poured through the cracks in its corporate wall.The midterm elections also showed that a real leap forward has no room for a circular firing squad. The agreement to disagree and work both sides of the road at once – an inside/outside strategy – is vital to victory.Those who want to work on the outside should by all means do so. Those who can maintain their principles while working inside the party must also do what needs to be done.Nobody is going to be 100% pure. Nobody can rightfully claim to have all the answers.But we do know this:By and large the cultural/identity revolution the Baby Boomers lit in the 1960s has hugely succeeded. America is far from entirely remade. But in terms of diversity we’re now a very new nation in many important ways (partly as witnessed in the faces of this new Congress) since Jack Kennedy won the 1960 election essentially with black votes. He rightly proclaimed the coming to power of a new generation then didn’t live to see its hopes bashed in the imperial futility of global conquest … or its victories in making this a far more diverse and open society than the one that killed him.Six decades later the Millennials must now lead and win the economic anti-imperial and ecological battles we need to survive.The Solartopian conversion must be funded not by new taxes but with money re-directed (as suggested by Code Pinand others) from the imperial military budget. It must happen as soon as humanly possible.In the Age of Trump the middle ground is gone.So while we use independent organizing to make the hard place of what we stand for irreducibly clear the rock of inside organizing must crack open and transform the Democratic Party.That won’t be easy.

This is an important time.America is a force for good in the Middle EasUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeecretary of State Mike Pompeo went to the American University in Cairo early this year to deliver what may be the clearest statement of foreign policy principles that will come from this administration. Pompeo’s speech began (see above) with his acknowledgement that he views the world through a pair of self-reinforcing ideologies: Christian evangelism and American Salvationism. The 3600-word speech has little overall coherence as Pompeo meanderingly applies his muscular Christian Americanism (he never suggests his view is shared by the president or anyone else) to a self-serving selection of issues. What follows are highlights from the speech in the order they appear with whatever commentary seems helpful. Pompeo has this to say about the Arab Spring that started in early 2o11 and spread across the Middle East:These lands witnessed convulsions from Tunis to Tehran as old systems crumbled and new ones struggled to emerge. That’s happened here [in Egypt] too.The preposterous dishonesty of this telegraphic summary of a complex nexus of only semi-related events tells you all you need to know about the sophistication and nuance of analysis at work at the top of the US government. Pompeo conflates developments in countries as varied and far apart as Morocco Tunisia Egypt Syria Bahrain and Iran (even though Iran isn’t Arab). The US absence from Tunisia and Morocco was more or less beneficial to both countries. The US was hardly absent from Bahrain where the US naval base benefited from the monarchy’s heavy-handed crushing of protest. The US was excessively involved in Libya which hasn’t recovered yet from our support.Pompeo’s soft-pedaling of Egypt (“That’s happened here too”) is particularly revelatory not only because he’s being polite to his host country but even more so because he’s shoving a whole lot of ugly history down the Orwellian memory hole. Egypt remember went from one of the uglier US-supported military dictatorships (happy to do our torture for us) to a constitutional democracy that chose Mohamed Morsi for President. When Morsi turned out to be too Islamist for the Egyptian military (and the US) he was overthrown in a military coup and replaced with a proper military-imposed democracy that elected a general to re-establish the current police state that isn’t quite as bad as the one before. See? America brings progress! But Egypt raises issues – democracy freedom of speech rule of law – whose absence in Egypt’s police state are of no great concern to Pompeo. That’s probably why he offers no explanation of what he means by “our leaders gravely misread our history and your historical moment.”That’s because he raised the whole Arab Spring nuisance (without naming it of course) for quite another purpose: to attackPresident Obama who also gave a foreign policy speech (5800 words)at the American University back in June 2009 one that was far more thoughtful and actually coherent regardless of what Pompeo said in his sleazy way without naming his boss’s predecessor:He told you that radical Islamist terrorism does not stem from an ideology.These are demonstrably false statements. Obama did not use the word “ideology” or the right-wing buzz phrase “radical Islamist terrorism” which only the credulous and uninformed would believe. Nor did Obama say 9/11 led the US “to abandon its ideals” though that would be more true than not what with torturing innocents bombing civilians and invading two countries that had not attacked us. What Obama actually said of 9/11 was that “in some cases it led us to act contrary to our ideals” – which is precisely true. But Pompeo’s attack on Obamafew in the media making the efforto point out that Pompeo was lying by attacking words that were never said.Maybe that’s because Pompeo does that a lo. Even so it’s not honorable journalism.Pompeo fulminates at length about ISIS Iran “Hizballah” and Bashar Assad without actually making any cogent or fully accurate point. He asserts that “… our desire for peace at any cost led us to strike a deal with Iran …” even though we were already at peace with Iran. He ignores the reality that thenuclear agreement with Iran has stopped Iran’s development of nuclear weaponand that this is confirmed by Iran’s cooperation with international inspectors. He also ignores the other parties to the deal – Russia China France UK Germany and the European Union – all of whom continue to support the deal despite the US pulling out (which has not yet taken effect). Pompeo and his cronies are the only ones claiming the deal is a failure but those claims are false disingenuous dishonest and supported by no evidence whatsoever. For all his name-calling on Iran Pompeo offers no specifics only loose allegations with no factual support. Pompeo reaches this conclusion about his quartet of bad actors:So today what did we learn from all of this? We learned that when America retreats chaos often follows. When we neglect our friends resentment builds. And when we partner with enemies they advance.This must be mere demagoguery. If Pompeo believes it he’s delusional. Where has America retreated? Not from Iraq not from Syria (yet) not from any of our myriad bases surrounding Iran and elsewhere across the Middle East and certainly not from Afghanistan (Pompeo never mentions Afghanistan). There was chaos in Libya because we intervened there’s chaos in Syria and Gaza there’s chaos in Iraq and Afghanistan there’s chaos in Yemen. Most of that chaos is at least partly due to US involvement (except Gaza where the US supports Israel’s crimes against humanity).When Pompeo says “when we partner with enemies they advance” he might be onto something. He probably means Iran but Iran hasn’t “advanced” and hasn’t invaded anyone in centuries (even though the US prompted Iraq to invade Iran). No what Pompeo unwittingly reveals most obviously is that when the US partners with Saudi Arabia the Saudis advance by propagating radical Islamist extremism across the globe by making war on Yemen with our blessing and in violation of international law and by threatening various of their neighbors including Iran and Qatar. Saudi Arabia is an autocratic repressive state in which human rights and freedoms exist at the fringes when they exist at all. The other Arab states (as well as Turkey) are similarly autocratic violent and anti-democratic. Or as Pompeo calls them our friends.Pompeo’s speech has a long passage designed to show how brilliantly the US has changed in the past two years virtually bringing a new Eden to the Middle East. None of it is credible or reality-based but it does have its share of hilariously absurd assertions:America has always been and always will be a liberating force not an occupying power….Whatever Pompeo may think “normal” means life is not likely to return to normal for Iraqis or Syrians any time soon even if “normal” doesn’t mean living under a stable dictatorship. When the mission as Pompeo argues is fighting terrorism then the mission is never over. And America does not have a pattern of leaving anywhere. America has combat forces in 165 countries these days give or take a few. America hasn’t left Syria Iraq or Afghanistan never mind South Korea Japan Germany Britain Italy and lord knows where else. The reality is that America for its entire existence has been an occupying power on the American continent.All this may seem just too obvious for words but remember this is a rebuttal of what the American Secretary of State – third in line for succession to the presidency – is telling the world what he claims to be the truth. And it’s not even close. And it gets worse.Pompeo spends the last third of his speech rambling through all the reasons the United States will remain at war for the foreseeable future. His argument goes something like this and I paraphrase: Iran Iran Iran in Yemen Hizballah Iran Iran Libya Iran rockets in Lebanon Iran Iran. He never mentions human rights. Anywhere.Pompeo’s hypocrisy shines most brightly when he talks about Yemen. He doesn’t mention Saudi killing of civilians or other war crimes or Yemeni cholera epidemics or Yemeni starvation or any of the other horrors perpetrated on the poorest nation in the region. Instead he claims the US has provided “robust humanitarian aid” and supported peace talks (albeit almost invisibly). Despite decades of American efforts to de-stabilize Yemen Pompeo boasts: “And in Yemen we will continue to work for a lasting peace.” This is a criminal war of endless atrocity that Pompeo fully embraces because: Iran (no evidence needed). But he’s too petty to give credit for the war where it’s deserved since that would mean praising Obama. Pompeo is happy to take the credit for continuing the work no matter who gets slaughtered hopefully Iran:America will not retreat until the terror fight is over….That pretty much sums up the ideology of a self-defined ideologue. America has never been an oppressor. America has never been an empire builder. America always was is and will be a force for good no matter who has to suffer for it.Original at Reader Supported News:,1
Is Tulsi Gabbard for Real? America Is Ready for a Genuine Peace Candidate | Freepress.orIs Tulsi Gabbard for Real? America Is Ready for a Genuine Peace CandidatThe lineup of Democrats who have already declared themselves as candidates for their party’s presidential nomination in 2020 is remarkable if only for the fact that so many wannabes have thrown their hats in the ring so early in the process. In terms of electability however one might well call the seekers after the highest office in the land the nine dwarfs. Four of the would-be candidates – Marianne Williamson a writer Andrew Yang an entrepreneur Julian Castro a former Obama official Senator Amy Klobuchar and Congressman John Delaney – have no national profiles at all and few among the Democratic Party rank-and-file would be able to detail who they are where they come from and what their positions on key issues might be.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has a national following but she also has considerable baggage. The recent revelation that sheas “American Indian” back in 1986 for purposes of career advancement which comes on top of similar reports of more of the same as well as other resume-enhancements that surfaced when she first became involved in national politics prompted Donald Trump to refer to her as “Pocahontas.” Warren who is largely progressive on social and domestic issues has been confronted numerous times regarding her views on Israel/Palestine and beyond declaring that she favors a “two state solution” has been somewhat reticent. She should be described as pro-Israel for the usual reasons and is not reliably anti-war. She comes across as a rather more liberal version of Hillary Clinton.And then there is New Jersey Senator Cory Booker being touted as the “new Obama” presumably because he is both black and progressive. His record as Mayor of Newark New Jersey which launched his career on the national stage has both high and low points and it has to be questioned if America is ready for another smooth-talking black politician whose actual record of accomplishments is on the thin side. One unfortunately recalls the devious Obama’s totally bogus Nobel Peace Prize and his Tuesday morning meetings with John Brennan to work on the list of Americans who were to be assassinated.Booker has carefully cultivated the Jewish community in his political career to include a close relationship with the stomach-churning “America’s Rabbi” Shmuley Boteach but has recently become more independent of those ties supporting the Obama deal with Iran and voting against anti-Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) legislation in the Senate. On the negative side the New York Times likes Booker which means that he will turn most other Americans off. He is also 49 years old and unmarried which apparently bothers some in the punditry.California Senator Kamala Harris is a formidable entrant into the crowded field due to her resume nominally progressive on most issues but with a work history that has attracted critics concerned by her hard-line law-and-order enforcement policies when she was District Attorney General for San Francisco and Attorney General for California. She has also is anti-BDS and is considered to be reliably pro-Israel which would rule her out for some though she might be appealing to middle of the road Democrats like the Clintons and Nancy Pelosi who have increasingly become war advocates. She will have a tough time convincing the antiwar crowd that she is worth supporting and there are reports that she will likely split the black women’s vote even though she is black herself perhaps linked to her affair with California powerbroker Willie Brown when she was 29 and Brown was 61. Brown was married though separated to a black woman at the time. Harris is taking heat because she clearly used the relationshipwhile also acquiring several patronage sinecures on state commissions that netted her hundreds of thousands of dollars.The most interesting candidate is undoubtedly Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard who is a fourth term Congresswoman from Hawaii where she was born and raised. She is also the real deal on national security having been-there and done-it through service as an officer with the Hawaiian National Guard on a combat deployment in Iraq. Though in Congress full time she still performs her Guard duty.Tulsi’s own military experience notwithstanding she gives every indication of being honestly anti-war. Inannouncing her candidacy she pledged “focus on the issue of war and peace” to “end the regime-change wars that have taken far too many lives and undermined our security by strengthening terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda.” She referred to the danger posed by blundering into a possible nuclear war and indicated her dismay over what appears to be a re-emergence of the Cold War.Not afraid of challenging establishment politicsan end to the “illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government” also observing that “the war to overthrow Assad is counter-productive because it actually helps ISIS and other Islamic extremists achieve their goal of overthrowing the Syrian government of Assad and taking control of all of Syria – which will simply increase human suffering in the region exacerbate the refugee crisis and pose a greater threat to the world.” She then backed up her words with action by secretly arranging for a personal trip to Damascus in 2017 to meet with President Bashar al-Assad saying it was important to meet adversaries “if you are serious about pursuing peace.” She made her own assessment of the situation in Syria and now favors pulling US troops out of the country as well as ending American interventions for “regime change” in the region.In 2015 Gabbard supported President Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran and more recently has criticized President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the deal. Last May she criticized Israel for shooting “unarmed protesters” in Gaza but one presumes that like nearly all American politicians she also has to make sure that she does not have the Israel Lobby on her back. Gabbard has spoken at a conference of Christians United for Israel which has defended Israel’s settlement enterprise; has backed legislation that slashes funding to the Palestinians; and has cultivated ties with Boteach as well as with major GOP donor casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. She also attended the controversial address to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March 2015 which many progressive Democrats boycotted.Nevertheless Tulsi supported Bernie Sanders’ antiwar candidacy in 2016 and appears to be completely onboard and fearless in promoting her antiwar sentiments. Yes Americans have heard much of the same before but Tulsi Gabbard could well be the only genuine antiwar candidate that might truly be electable in the past fifty years.What Tulsi Gabbard is accomplishing might be measured by the enemies that are already gathering and are out to get her. Glenn Greenwald aton February 1st claiming that “experts who track websites and social media linked to Russia have seen stirrings of a possible campaign of support for Hawaii Democrat Tulsi Gabbard.”But the expert cited by NBC turned out to be a firm New Knowledgewhich was exposed by no less than The New York Timefor falsifying Russian troll accounts for the Democratic Party in the Alabama Senate race to suggest that the Kremlin was interfering in that election. According to Greenwald the group ultimately behindThe Alliance for Securing Democrac(ASD) which sponsors a tool called a news “intelligence net checker” that claims to track Russian efforts to disseminate disinformation. The ASDadvises that “Securing Democracy is a Global Necessity.”ASD was set up in 2017 by the usual neocon crowd with funding from The Atlanticist and anti-Russian German Marshall Fund. It isa full complement of Zionists and interventionists/globalists to include Michael Chertoff Michael McFaul Michael Morell Kori Schake and Bill Kristol. It claims innocently to be a bipartisan transatlantic national security advocacy group that seeks to identify and counter efforts by Russia to undermine democracies in the United States and Europe but it is actually itself a major source of disinformation.For the moment Tulsi Gabbard seems to be the “real thing” a genuine anti-war candidate who is determined to run on that platform. It might just resonate with the majority of American who have grown tired of perpetual warfare to “spread democracy” and other related frauds perpetrated by the band of oligarchs and traitors that run the United States. We the people can always hope.,1
Bernie Sanders Starts Mentioning the Military Budget | Freepress.orBernie Sanders Starts Mentioning the Military BudgeBernie Sanders has added the existence of foreign policy onto the bottom of emails like the one below after having postedof himself quoting the usual Eisenhower quotes on military spending. These changes match the request made when World BEYOND War and RootsAction.org asked 100 prominent people to sign anopen letter to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanderurging him to address military spending. Over 13000 more people signed it. Let’s hope that Senator Sanders builds on this progress. Let’s take the same demand to other politicians.Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a very healthy and happy new year.It goes without saying that 2019 will be a pivotal and momentous time for our country and the entire planet. As you know there is a monumental clash now taking place between two very different political visions. Not to get you too nervous but the future of our country and the world is dependent upon which side wins that struggle.The bad news is that in the United States and other parts of the world the foundations of democracy are under severe attack as demagogues supported by billionaire oligarchs work to establish authoritarian type regimes. That is true in Russia. That is true in Saudi Arabia. That is true in the United States. While the very rich get much richer these demagogues seek to move us toward tribalism and set one group against another deflecting attention from the real crises we face.The good news is that all across this country people are getting politically involved and are fighting back. They are standing up for economic political social and racial justice.In the last year we saw courageous teachers in some of the most conservative states in the country win strikes as they fought for adequate funding for education.We saw low paid workers at Amazon Disney and elsewhere undertake successful struggles to raise their wages to a living wage – at least $15 an hour.We saw incredibly courageous young people who experienced a mass shooting in their school lead successful efforts for commonsense gun safety legislation.We saw diverse communities stand together in the fight against mass incarceration and for real criminal justice reform.We saw tens of thousands of Americans from every walk of life take to the streets and demand that politicians respond to the global crisis of climate change.As we enter 2019 it seems to me that we must mount a two-pronged offensive. First we must vigorously take on the lies bigotry and kleptocratic behavior of the most irresponsible president in the modern history of our country. In every way possible we must stand up to the racism sexism homophobia xenophobia and religious intolerance of the Trump administration.But fighting Trump is not enough.The truth is that despite relatively low unemployment tens of millions of Americans struggle daily to keep their heads above water economically as the middle class continues to shrink.While the rich get richer 40 million live in poverty millions of workers are forced to work two or three jobs to pay the bills 30 million have no health insurance one in five cannot afford their prescription drugs almost half of older workers have nothing saved for retirement young people cannot afford college or leave school deeply in debt affordable housing is increasingly scarce and many seniors cut back on basic needs as they live on inadequate Social Security checks.Our job therefore is not only to oppose Trump but to bring forth a progressive and popular agenda that speaks to the real needs of working people. We must tell Wall Street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military-industrial complex the National Rifle Association and the other powerful special interests that we will not continue to allow their greed to destroy this country and our planet.Politics in a democracy should not be complicated. Government must work for all of the people not just the wealthy and the powerful. As a new House and Senate convene next week it is imperative that the American people stand up and demand real solutions to the major economic social racial and environmental crises that we face. In the richest country in the history of the world here are some (far from all) of the issues that I will be focusing on this year. What do you think? How can we best work together?: Repeal Citizens United move to public funding of elections and end voter suppression and gerrymandering. Our goal must be to establish a political system that has the highest voter turnout in the world and is governed by the democratic principle of one person – one vote.Take on the billionaire clas: End oligarchy and the growth of massive income and wealth inequality by demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes. We must rescind Trump’s tax breaks for billionaires and close corporate tax loopholes.: Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour establish pay equity for women and revitalize the trade union movement. In the United States if you work 40 hours a week you should not live in poverty.Make health care a righ: Guarantee health care for everyone through a Medicare-for-all program. We cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us about twice as much per capita as any other major country and leaves 30 million uninsured.: Combat the global crisis of climate change which is already causing massive damage to our planet. In the process we can create millions of good paying jobs as we transform our energy system away from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.: Pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan. In the United States we must not continue to have roads bridges water systems rail transport and airports in disrepair.: There is an enormous amount of work to be done throughout our country – from building affordable housing and schools to caring for our children and the elderly. 75 years ago FDR talked about the need to guarantee every able-bodied person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today.: Make public colleges and universities tuition free lower student debt adequately fund public education and move to universal childcare. Not so many years ago the United States had the best education system in the world. We much regain that status again.: Expand Social Security so that every American can retire with dignity and everyone with a disability can live with security. Too many of our elderly disabled and veterans are living on inadequate incomes. We must do better for those who built this country.: It is a woman not the government who should control her own body. We must oppose all efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade protect Planned Parenthood and oppose restrictive state laws on abortion.: End mass incarceration and pass serious criminal justice reform. We must no longer spend $80 billion a year locking up more people than any other country. We must invest in education and jobs not jails and incarceration.: It is absurd and inhumane that millions of hardworking people many of whom have lived in this country for decades are fearful of deportation. We must provide legal status to those who are in the DACA program and a path to citizenship for the undocumented.: End discrimination based on race gender religion place of birth or sexual orientation. Trump cannot be allowed to succeed by dividing us up. We must stand together as one people.: Let us create a foreign policy based on peace democracy and human rights. At a time when we spend more on the military than the next ten countries combined we need to take a serious look at reforming the bloated and wasteful $716 billion annual Pentagon budget.In the New Year let us resolve to fight like we have never fought before for a government a society and an economy that works for all of us not just those on top.Wishing you a wonderful new year,1
"Jeff Sessions reportedly is planning a return to Alabama politics and the U.S. Senate following his unceremonious ouster as Donald Trump's AG | Freepress.orJeff Sessions reportedly is planning a return to Alabama politics and the U.S. Senate following his unceremonious ouster as Donald Trump's A(Updated at 9:30 a.m. on 11/8/18)Sessions is expected to return to state politica report this morning atNow-former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reportedly eyeing a return to politics in the Yellowhammer State.that he is considering a run for his old seat as Alabama’s junior senator.Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is considering running for his old Alabama Senate seat in 2020 according to two people familiar with his thinking.Former Republican Sen. Luther Strange who was temporarily appointed to Sessions’ former seat took to Twitter on Wednesday evening to encourage a comeback bid.“Jeff Sessions for Senate in 2020!” Strange wrote.says the answer is ""not necessarily"":Sessions who spent two decades in the Senate is practically a household name in his home state and speculation has been simmering for weeks within Alabama political circles that he might seek a return. Yet party officials stress that the 71-year-old Sessions wouldn’t necessarily face a clear path should he wage a comeback. Trump’s relentless attacks on the former attorney general they say have taken a toll on his popularity in the state.Sessions lied multiple times to Congress about his interactions with Russian interestduring the 2016 presidential campaign -- seems to be left out of the political calculus. Also ignored is evidence thatthe Alabama State Bar is providing cover for Sessionby ignoring bar complaints based on his false statements to Congress.Donald Trump would fire Jeff Sessionas U.S. attorney general so soon after voters gave the Alabama Republican Party --largely forged in Sessions' smarmy crooked imag-- resounding victories in yesterday's midterm elections. Asa citizen who repeatedly has been cheatein the dysfunctional legal and political environment that Sessions helped create I find it highly ironic that ""the Evil Elf"" now is being shown the door for failing to adequately protect a man -- who likely will go down as the most corrupt president in U.S. history -- from criminal investigation.created the postmodern era of political prosecutionin the ""Heart of Dixie."" But even Sessions could not ignore the mountain of evidence that he was connected to Russian election meddling in 2016 -- and in facthas been tied to the Russian mafia and its oligarchwhile serving as U.S. senator -- and thus had no choice but to recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.Sessions' No. 1 political talent is cheatin but forced to remove himself from anything involving the Mueller probe he was useless as a cheater on Trump's behalf.they said government corruption and ethics were their top concerns going into the midterm. So what did they do? By sizable majorities theydecided at least four statewide races by choosing candidates -- all Republicans -- with clear ties to corrupt politician. Here is a rundown:-- Kay Ivey swamped Democratic challenger Walt Maddox 61 to 39 percent.Ivey has been paying the legal feeof her scandal-plagued predecessor Robert ""Luv Guv Bentleyeven though state law does not require ilong has been aligned with former Gov. Bob Rile the Big Kahuna of Alabama corruption. Does any of that bother Alabama voters who supposedly are concerned about unethical government? Apparently not.-- Steve Marshall defeated Democrat Joseph Siegelman 60-40 percent even though Marshall was appointed to the position by the hideously corrupt Bentley --in exchange for a promise to investigate prosecutorin the case of former House Speaker Mike Hubbard. On top of thatMarshall accepted more than $700000 in apparently unlawful campaign contributionfrom the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA). Marshall could be prosecuted and removed from office pronto but that doesn't seem to trouble Alabama voters in the least.Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice-- Tom Parker easily defeated Democrat Robert Vance 58-42 percent -- and that actually was the closest of these races. Parker long has been an ally of former Chief Justice Roy Moorewho was booted from the benchfor directing lower-court judges to decline to issue same-sex marriage licenses in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. In fairness to voters they had no good choice in this race. Vance isnothing but a stooge for large corporate law firm such as Maynard Cooper Gale Balch Bingham Adams and Reese/Lange Simpson.Alabama Supreme Court Place 4-- Jay Mitchell defeated Democrat Donna Smalley 61-39 percent even though he is directly tied to Mike Hubbard who arguably is the poster boy for smelly political deals. As a partner at Maynard Cooper GaleMitchell was one of the architectsHubbard's failed (so far) criminal appea. Being tied to one of the most corrupt politicos in modern Alabama history did not hurt Mitchell's chances with voters.",1
"Trump's Pittsburgh Holocaust | Freepress.orIn 1939 the luxury liner St. Louis brought 937 desperate mostly Jewish refugees to Miami. They were fleeing the Nazi Holocaust. They had already been turned away by Cuba.Amidst a Red Wave of ""nationalist"" hate American ""conservatives"" screamed that these people were poor didn't speak English and would take away our precious resources.So Franklin Roosevelt did not let them into the United States. The ship was sent back to Europe. Nearly every Jew on it perished in Hitler's concentration and death camps.Throughout Germany Poland and everywhere else Hitler spread his hate fascists were marching into synagogues like the Tree of Life in Pittsburgh gunning down Jews.Today a caravan of desperate refugees is making its way from central America. They are fleeing a slaughterhouse of fascist murder and violence as well as desperate poverty imposed by the relentless exploitation of imperial corporations.The current occupant of the White House intends to use them as props in an ""October Surprise"" to whip up bigotry and hate. He's called this ""the caravan election"" and hopes it will help his party solidify his control over Congress and statehouses around the US. Such a disaster would result in the closest thing to a pure fascist state the US has experienced since virtual totalitarianism was imposed by Woodrow Wilson during and after World War I.Trump has now deployed some 5200 troops to our southern border. He's followed in Hitler's footsteps by cruelly separating hundreds of children from their families locking them into concentration camps hidden from the public eye. The physical and psychological damage to those who survive is unspeakable and permanent.Meanwhile a right-wing Trump follower blaming Jews for the caravan has opened fire in a Pittsburgh synagogue killing eleven people shattering a community terrifying Jews worldwide.The horror is all too predictable. Trump has a Jewish son-in-law and his daughter has converted. He does not explicitly attack Jews (yet). But true meaning of his rhetoric about ""globalists"" and attacks on George Soros and other Jewish liberals is unmistakable.Above all Trump is an apostle of hate. His attacks Muslims Hispanics African-Americans and ""others"" comprise a traditional fascist assault on decency and democracy. The rhetoric and targets may be somewhat different but the strategy and tactics are those of Hitler.In such an atmosphere it's no surprise the large and permanent pool of anti-semitism on the hateful right would puke up a murderer like the one in Pittsburgh. That Trump would dare show his face at a memorial for the victims is almost as unspeakable as the act itself. The only real question is when and where it will happen next.Franklin Roosevelt lacked the courage and backbone to allow the Jewish refugees on the St. Louis into the United States. Their death is forever on his soul.Donald Trump has now whipped up the whirlwind that has slaughtered still more Jews in Pittsburgh. He intends to use this ""Red Wave"" of bigotry and violence to solidify a fascist regime that can only lead to more slaughter.The refugees on their way from central America are no different from those who came on the St. Louis. The killings in Pittsburgh are no different from those that ravaged Hitler's Europe.The only real question now is whether Trump will be allowed to use them to solidify his power as Hitler did.Harvey Wasserman's Green Power &amp; Wellness Show is podcast at.

GOP Governor Defends His Trump-Style Ethics? | Freepress.orGOP Governor Defends His Trump-Style Ethics?Vermont governor Phil Scott. (photo: Civilized)Think about the implications of this. If all you have to do is make a complaint and the next day the headlines are ‘Someone is unethical’ think about what’s going to happen to politics in Vermont…. It seems suspect to me that a powerful political organization makes a complaint during October of an election year.Phil Scott Republican at press conferencefore you start feeling sorry for the governor of Vermont whose comment above is fundamentally deceitful you should probably be aware that he is being criticized for an arrangement he created for his own benefit.Before he was elected governor in 2o16 Phil Scott had spent 30 years in the construction business. He washalf-owner of Dubois Construction Inc. a family-owned and operated company that frequently does business with the state of Vermont (its web site features a picture of a Dubois project at the Vermont State Capitol). Once he was elected Scott recognized the conflict of interest problem for a governor who owned a company doing business with the state.Scott’s solution to the problem came in two parts. The first part was straightforward: he sold his share of the company for $2.5 million. The second part was trickier since he financed the loan himself lending the company the money with which to buy his share from him. As a result Scott turned himself into a governor who received $75000 in loan payments in 2017 from a company still tied to him financially and still doing business with the state. As governor Scott appoints the officials who decide what contracts to sign with Dubois Construction.Scott made no secret of this arrangement arguing that it was reasonable since he no longer had any operational role in Dubois Construction.In early 2017 the state entered intoa $250000 contract with Dubois Constructio lasting from June 15 2017 to June 14 2019 providing Site and Earthwork Services. There appear to be no allegations of impropriety relating to this 53-page contract. But the fact of a contract with Dubois was a change in circumstance and put the governor’s relationship with his company in a new context where he is now involved on both sides of a deal with the state.In January 2018 the Vermont Public Interest Research Group (VPIRG) filed an inquiry about Scott’s holding in Dubois with the Vermont State Ethics Commissionestablished by statute in 201by the Vermont Legislature effective January 1 2018:There is created within the Executive Branch an independent commission named the State Ethics Commission to accept review make referrals regarding and track complaints of alleged violations of governmental conduct regulated by law of the Department of Human Resources Code of Ethics and of the State's campaign finance law set forth in 17 V.S.A. chapter 61; to provide ethics training; and to issue guidance and advisory opinions regarding ethical conduct.Governor Scott signed the bill into law on June 14 2017 creating Vermont’s first-ever ethics commission calling it “a positive step forward to demonstrate to Vermonters that its elected officials are committed to restoring … faith and trust across all three branches of state government.” Scott also said that the legislation was “an overdue step as most other states have existing ethics commissions disclosure laws and conflict-of-interest rules already in place.”The bill was a response to a 2015 study bythe Center for Public Integrity in Washingtothat faulted Vermont’s approach to public ethics.As the Center reported iVermont received a grade of F from the State Integrity Investigation and ranked 50th out of 50 states in the category of ethics enforcement because it previously had no ethics body of any sort a rarity among the states. Vermont’s overallwas D minus ranking it 37th out of the 50 states.VPIRG’s inquiry in January 2018 was the first to come before the Ethics Commission which was entirely unready to deal with it. The inquiry asserted no violation of law or ethics code. There was no ethics code because the commission had not yet adopted one (even though the statute cited one). The commission adopted an ethics code on June 6 2018.On August 31 VPIRG returned to the commission with aone-page request for an advisory opinioon the ethics of a Vermont governor holding a loan to a company doing business with state officials appointed by the governor.The governor said he had asked the commissioif it had any questions for him: “I’d offered to come before them offered any information they might need.” He said the commission did not respond. The commission has no authority to investigate hold hearings or take testimony. The governor submitted no documents to the commission. And the governor knew – or should have known – that the law he signed creating the commission gave it no authority to investigate anyone. Given the chance to accept a reality that doesn’t appear very terrible the governor chose to obfuscate and deceive. What’s that about?On October 1 the commission issued itsthree-page Ethics Advisory Opinion 18-0as provided by statute (above). The commission reached to first the obvious conclusion that the governor has a “perceived conflict of interest” because VPIRG in fact perceived it. The commission further concluded that the governor “has a conflict of interest because he is financially intertwined as a creditor who has an ongoing financial interest in a company that contracts with the State which the public official as governor is the chief executive officer.”The advisory opinion doesn’t mention Scott by name even though there’s no question that he’s the subject of the opinion. This creates a slightly surreal effect as the opinion concludes:All public officials are expected to comply with the State Code of Ethics: General Principles of Governmental Ethical Conduct. The State Ethics Commission strongly urges public officials to proactively seek ethics guidance from the State Ethics Commission on ways they can avoid and mitigate conflicts of interest.That’s pretty bland advice and hard to argue with unless you’re someone like President Trump and then you may just as well ignore it anyway because you’re so far past being concerned about ethical or even lawful behavior anything you say might be used against you. Vermont’s Governor Scott does not seem to have ethical problems of Trumpian dimension nor is he accused of hiding anything or breaking any law. All that makes one wonder why his response is quintessentially Trumpian.The governor claims that “all you have to do is make a complaint and the next day the headlines are ‘Someone is unethical’” – that’s patently false. The “complaint” began in January was reiterated in August and there were no headlines until October and then they said he had a perceived conflict of interest problem – which has been obvious all along – not that he’s unethical. That judgment has yet to be made.The governor then goes all conspiracy theory on the question: “It seems suspect to me that a powerful political organization makes a complaint during October of an election year …” If this isn’t a lie then it’s a failure of integrity. The governor has only to read the primary documents to know that his problem has always been there that his solution was self-dealing that the VPIRG “complaint” was made in January and again in August. The governor is not the victim of a political dirty trick any more than Brett Kavanaugh. There was no dirty trick there is only the governor’s unwillingness to accept the consequences of a situation he himself created. Instead of forthrightly addressing the reality he created the governor chose to go paranoid and conspiratorial.There is a standard provision in the current state contract with Dubois Construction that prohibits the company from giving “title or possession of anything of substantial value” to any officer or employee of the state such as the governor. Dubois payment of $75000 to the governor during 2017 while the contract was in effect would appear to violate that standing rule. The commission noted that the question “is beyond the scope of this advisory opinion.” The commission has not assessed whether the contract provision has been breached but has referred that question to the Vermont Attorney General.,1
Democratic Autopsy: One Year Later | Freepress.orDemocratic Autopsy: One Year LateNorman Solomon Jeff Cohen Pia Gallegos Sam McCann and DoOriginally published at the Nation Magazine:In October 2017 a team of progressive researchers published “Autopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisi” which probed the causes of the disastrous 2016 election defeat. The report came in the wake of the party leadership’s failure to do its own autopsy. In a cover story forthat the “Autopsy” is “an unemotional dissection of why the Democrats failed so miserably and it warns that the party must change profoundly or else remain a loser.”Now “Democratic Autopsy: One Year Later” evaluates how well the Democratic Party has done in charting a new course since the autumn of 2017. This report rates developments in each of the seven categories that the original report assessed.The upsurge of progressive activism and electoral victories during the last year has created momentum that could lead to historic breakthroughs in the midterm elections and far beyond. Realizing such potential will require transforming and energizing the Democratic Party.Corporate Power and the PartThe Democratic Party has implemented modest reforms but corporate power continues to dominate the party. In 2017 and early summer 2018 the Democratic National Committee voted to refuse donations from a handful of toxic industries that contradict the party’s platform—though the ban on fossil-fuel money was effectively repealed in August 2018. Meanwhile thecontinue to freely take big corporate donations.A test for Democrats on Capitol Hill came this year when the GOP successfully worked with powerful bank lobbyists to weaken the Dodd-Frank Act (under the guise of helping small community banks). More than one-third of Senate Democrats joined the effort; many were recipients of significant banking donations. In the House 33 Democrats joined most Republicans to pass the measure; journalist David Dayen reported that nearly all of the 33 identify as corporate “New Democrats.”In September House minority leader Nancy Pelosi preemptivelyany potential left-populist agenda on Capitol Hill by backing reinstatement of a “pay-go” rule to offset all new spending with tax increases or budget cuts. A former legislative director for three Democrats in Congress Justin Talbot-Zornpointing out that “bold progressivism and ‘pay-go’ fiscal conservatism are mutually exclusive.” He added: “The existential challenge of climate change demands that we fully overhaul our energy and transportation infrastructure in a short period of time. The issues of America’s rising inequality and frayed social contract—including stagnant wages unaffordable college and exorbitant health care can only be fixed with major new investments.”After writing a recent analysis forthat looked at how Democratic leaders act on economic issues in states (from California to Connecticut) that they politically control David Sirota put his conclusions in a: Democrats in blue states “have used their power to block single payer &amp; a public option enrich Wall St subsidize corporations slash pensions lay off teachers promote fracking &amp; engage in pay to play corruption.”For the Democratic Party a crucial disconnect remains between rhetoric about corporate influence and subservience to it.In the summer of 2018 Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez told a predominantly black audience: “We lost elections not only in November 2016 but we lost elections in the run-up because we stopped organizing.… We took too many people for granted and African Americans—our most loyal constituency—we all too frequently took for granted. That is a shame on us folks and for that I apologize. And for that I say it will never happen again!”During the last 12 months voters of color have been key to notable electoral wins. But the party has a long way to go to fulfill Perez’s promise.In the November 2017 Virginia gubernatorial election Democrat Ralph Northam “won three-quarters of the votes overall” in racial-minority neighborhoods. “Margins grew by 10 percent in Hispanic neighborhoods.” Black voters turned out in higher numbers than they had before. Unfortunately Northam’s campaign spending priorities were distressingly similar to the party’s 2016 behavior. Groups like BlackPAC and New Virginia Majority handled essential local black organizing but had aAlabama’s special election for a Senate seat tells a similar slightly more encouraging story. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore a man accused of pedophilia and with a history of racist remarks. Jones won 96 percent of the black vote accounting for 29 percent of total votes cast—more than the state’s 27 percent black population. BlackPAC and other groups including local NAACP chapters organized and knocked on more than 500000 doors with a tailored message addressing criminal-justice reform education and health care. The DNC also contributed to operations spending around $1 million on engaging black and millennial voters. Jones like Northam spent big onDonald Trump’s assault on immigrants has mobilized some in the party to be stronger on immigrants’ rights. Yet congressional Democrats were seen as having sold out Dreamers in their budget negotiations with Republicans. An April 2018 poll found that while 40 percent of Hispanics believe Democrats care about Dreamers 54 percent believe they’re “using this issue for political gain.”Likewise the Democratic Party must do much more to reform the police and justice systems. Eighty percent of Democrats want reform and 87 percent want to decrease the prison population. Running for Philadelphia district attorney as a comprehensive reformer Larry Krasner showed that these desires for change could beinto a winning campaign; turnout for his November 2017 election wasthan in previous DA elections. Krasner went on to implement policies such as dropping marijuana charges and dismissing problematic prosecutors in the DA’s office.Such policy approaches coupled with grassroots organizing enabled police accountability advocate Randall Woodfin to win the Birmingham Alabama mayoral race in 2017 and enabled progressive Democrat Earnell Lucas to win the race for Milwaukee County Wisconsin sheriff in August 2018. These campaigns suggest a path forward for Democratic candidates—where the priority is to inspire voters and maximize turnout rather than to woo “persuadable” Republicans.Young People and the PartThe Democratic Party still isn’t offering a bold vision that can excite young adults a demographic known for not voting much. Looking to the 2018 midterms the party put out its “Better Deal for Our Democrac” platform. This is a modest step forward—especially the “Crack Down on Corporate Monopolies”—but missing is a focus on the bread-and-butter issues that can materially affect young people’s lives such as redirecting resources from our bloated military towardfor free college education and Medicare for All.Young people more than their older counterparts are increasingly against obscene military budgets and US wars. But citizens with those views are without powerful representation in Washington. Sixty-eight percent of House Democrats and 85 percent of Democratic senatorsthe record-breaking 2019 military budget of over $700 billion including expansion of theOn the issue of paying for college party leaders have made a bit of progress. But instead of taking a clear stance in favor of free public college tuition—something a strong majority of Democrats support—congressional Democrats proposed a law in July that would subsidize community colleges only and work to “make college more affordable by reducing debt and simplifying financial aid” asreported. It’s a tepid approach.Like a growing number offor local and state offices as well as congressional seats most Democratic presidential contenders for 2020 have learned to push some compelling simple policy measures. But the Democratic leadership is still using a 1990s-era playbook of technocratic half-measures that don’t inspire—or bring out to the polls—America’s youth.Voter Participation and the PartThe depressed turnout that cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election was due to both voter suppression efforts by Republicans and the Democratic Party’s own inability to mobilize its base. The party has made some progress on both counts.To diminish turnout GOP strategists keep targeting people of color the young and others apt to cast ballots for Democrats. The DNC’s response has grown more robust in the past year with the creation of the “IWillVote” program to register new voters and fight voter suppression. The initiative has provided grants in 41 states and territories aiming to reach 50 million voters by November.The party has also supported restoring felons’ right to vote. In April New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged to restore suffrage to felons on parole. In Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and party leaders are supporting a ballot measure to restore felons’ voting rights.to vote has emerged as a popular and practical way to address discriminatory voter restrictions. In 2018 eight states and the District of Columbia approved or began implementing automatic voter registration. These laws were virtually nonexistent three years ago but now 13 states and DC have them.Yet most party leaders have remained hesitant to promote other clearly popular policies. And voters in marginalized communities often see scant difference between the two major parties. The Democratic Party could dramatically boost voter participation by mobilizing around progressive proposals that are such as higher taxes on the wealthy Medicare for All a $15 minimum wage stronger environmental protectionsThe Democratic Party routinely fails to take full electoral advantage of such public opinion—a major factor in its fundamental lack of credibility with voters. A Quinnipiac poll in March 2018 showed just 31 percent of the country had a positive view of Democrats—down from 37 percent four months earlier and 44 percent a year earlier according to CNN polls. Voter turnout falls short when many are left doubting that the Democratic Party will make good on its progressive rhetoric.Social Movements and the PartFrom the party-platform struggles of 2016 through the “Summer for Progress” coalition convened by Our Revolution in the summer of 2017 the DNC seemed tone-deaf to the policy demands of its base. When Summer for Progress activists marched to DNC headquarters in Washington they were met outside the front door byBut since mid-2017 many party leaders have been pulled along by the grassroots. The House of Representatives recently saw theof a Medicare for All caucus with at least 70 members. Even ex-President Obama. A year ago aheadline summed up the momentum: “The stunning Democratic shift on single-payer: In 2008 no leading Democratic presidential candidate backed single-payer. In 2020 all of them might.”Student survivors of the mass shooting at Florida’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School became leaders of an intense new push for gun control. Within six weeks the #NeverAgain movement helped organize the March for Our Lives in Washington—with 800 solidarity events across the country—and a national voter-registration drive. Though most congressional Democrats had been avoiding or downplaying the gun-control issue it became hard to ignore this youth movement.Another youth-energized groundswell the climate-justice movement was dealt a slap in the face by the DNC’s reversal on accepting donations from the fossil-fuel industry. A: “This sort of spineless corporate pandering is why Democrats keep losing.”This has been a banner year for successful primary campaigns by progressive Democrats nationwide allied with organizations such as Our Revolution Justice Democrats Democratic Socialists of America People’s Action Democracy for America Citizen Action Working Families Party and Progressive Democrats of America to name just a few groups that knocked on doors and e-mail inboxes all year. In New York State there was the defeat of powerhouse Representative Joe Crowley by 28-year-old Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and then a progressive deluge that unseated six “Independent Democratic” state senators—corporatists allied with the GOP and Democratic Governor Cuomo. If there’s a “blue wave” in November much of the credit will belong to grassroots groups.How did the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee react to this grassroots energy? Often by intervening on behalf of(where the DCCC publicly attacked progressive candidate Laura Moser). Social movements have the ability to energize the Democratic Party but not if blocked by party leaders.Chants of “No More War” from delegates at the 2016 Democratic National Convention gave voice to sentiments that still resonate through the party’s base and the broader US public notably in communities withhigher rates of military sacrific. While Trump’s 2016 victories in swing states may have been aided by his posing as a foe of protracted war his administration’s Middle East policies have exposed that masquerade. Unfortunately the positions of Democratic leaders on endless war and military spending offer little alternative.Few Democrats in Congress are willing to strongly challenge the unaccountable military budget which soaks up most discretionary spending that could be redirected toward the party’s proclaimed domestic agenda. During federal-budget negotiations early this year—with Trump requesting a huge Pentagon-budget increase—Nancy Pelosi boasted in an e-mail to House Democrats: “In our negotiations Congressional Democrats have been fighting for increases in funding for defense.” The office of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer declared: “We fully support President Trump’s Defense Department’s request.” Months later an overwhelming majority of House and Senate Democrats supported the massive 2019 “National Defense Authorization Act” of $716 billion.Trump has a dangerous admiration for authoritarian leaders. Democrats need to condemn such admiration without succumbing to reckless bellicosity.The United States and Russia possess 93 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons. Yet many Democratic leaders seem oblivious to the threat of armed conflict with Russia—a peril profoundly understood by Democratic presidents during the height of the Cold War.to evidence of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election numerous Democrats engaged in extreme rhetoric calling it an “act of war” and “equivalent” to Pearl Harbor. Democratic leaders have rarely acknowledged the crucial need for “a shift in approach toward Russia” including “steps to ease tensions between the nuclear superpowers” in the words of an open letter calling for “Election Security and True National Security” released this summer.On matters of war and peace—for instance the 17-year war in Afghanistan and the Trump team’s extremely one-sided Israel-Palestine policy—top Democrats have offered few alternative policies. They’ve made scant objections to Trump administration actions that a director at Amnesty International USA Daphne Eviatar hasas “hugely expanding the use of drone and airstrikes including outside of war zones and increasing civilian casualties in the process.”The party leadership has routinely been absent in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen caused primarily by the US-backed Saudi war. In March Bernie Sanders Democrat Chris Murphy and Republican Mike Lee forced a vote on their Senate resolution to end US military support for the Saudis in Yemen. In the face of White House opposition and indifference among Democratic leaders it went down to defeat (55-44) thanks to. With the disaster continuing to worsen in Yemen the House Democratic leadershipdragged its feet while progressiveeffort to get a vote on a similar measure; finally in late September Khanna was able to introduce the resolution with some high-level partyDemocrats often denounce the GOP for immoral and extremist domestic policies favoring the powerful. The party’s failure to challenge such foreign policies is a moral and political tragedy.Efforts to democratize the Democratic Party made some progress in August 2018 when the full DNC voted to bar superdelegates from voting for the presidential nominee on the first ballot. This reduction in the power of superdelegates grew out of anger among Bernie Sanders supporters about DNC favoritism for Hillary Clinton. In the end the reform passed with much support from the Clinton wing of the party and a major assist from DNC chair Tom Perez.Contrary to claims made by superdelegate defenders the reform moved toward greater racial diversity at the national convention. In 2016 the Pew Research Center found that 20 percent of superdelegates were black and about 36 percent were people of color; numbers provided by the Hillary Clinton campaign showed that convention delegates as a whole werethan superdelegates—25 percent black and 50 percent people of color.The DNC’S encouraging action on superdelegate reform contrasts sharply with the DNC’s failure to act on a proposal by its Unity Reform Commission to establish a Financial Oversight Committee that would present an annual report on the DNC budget to the entire DNC so that it could assess the effectiveness of expenditures and staff as required by the DNC’s Bylaws. The current Finance Committee—entirely appointed by the DNC chair—conducts no such evaluations. A Financial Oversight Committee could help achieve what the DNC still lacks: transparency and accountability in howTo get closer to living up to its name the Democratic Party should rely on a broad base of small donors and refuse donations from corporations particularly those with interests adverse to the party’s platform. The DNC’s reversal of its ban on fossil-fuel donations was a step backward.This summer the DNC voted in reforms to promote more openness and accessibility in presidential primaries and caucuses. The reforms urge state parties to work with their state government to combat voter suppression and implement measures such as same-day party switching and same-day registration. An extreme example of antidemocratic obstacles is in the state of New York where voters must declare their party affiliation more than six months in advance.Barriers to democracy inside the Democratic Party have obstructed efforts to make the party a powerful vehicle for progressive change. During the last year grassroots pressure has reduced some of those barriers. Looking ahead a truly democratic Democratic Party could profoundly revitalize the politics of our country.Norman Solomon is a journalist with a project of the Institute for Public Accuracy; the author of; and a co-founder ofJeff Cohen is the founder of the media watch group FAIR and co-founder of RootsAction.org.Pia Gallegos is the Chair of the Adelante Progressive Caucus of the Democratic Party of New Mexico.Sam McCann is a writer and researcher whose recent projects include Michael Moore’sDonna Smith is the National Advisory Board Chair of Progressive Democrats of America.,1
The Two Brett Kavanaugh Stories | Freepress.orThe Two Brett Kavanaugh StorieThere were two simultaneous Brett Kavanaugh stories. Together as part of the confirmation process regarding his nomination as Supreme Court Justice they revealed how political discourse in the United States has reached a new low with debate over the man’s possible predilection to make judgments based on his own preferences rather than the US Constitution being ignored in favor of the politically motivated kabuki theater that was deliberately arranged to avoid that issue and instead go after his character.Consider first of all his flaws as a candidate. He was regularly framed as a “conservative” but what did that mean in the context of his career? Some of the critics are referring to his time spent as a government lawyer specifically for the George W. Bush Administration where he was a supporter of wide executive authority in the context of the war against terror while others point to his decisions and writings during his time as a US Circuit judge from 2006 until the present. That meant essentially that Kavanaugh then supported and apparentlywhat is now referred to as the John Yoo doctrine named after the Department of Justice lawyer who penned the memo that made the case for the president to act unilaterally todo whatever is required in national security caseeven if there be no direct or immediate threat. Yoo specifically argued that the president by virtue of his office is not bound by the War Crimes Act. This theory of government also more broadly dubbed the unitary executive was popularized by Yoo fellow government lawyer Jay Bybee and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago.For those who find Kavanaugh unacceptable in terms of his judicial philosophy this repudiation of the constitutional principle of three branches of government that check each other was enough to disqualify him from a position on the Supreme Court principally as it impacts on both the first and second articles of the constitution by granting to the president the authority to both begin and continue a war on his own recognizance. It also means that the president on his own authority can suspend first and fourth amendment rights to freedom of speech and association as well as freedom from illegal search. He supported for example the government’s “right” to conduct mass searches of private data such as was conducted by the NSA. Kavanaugh supports government authority to legitimize incarceration without trial and to order assassinations and torture. Kavanaugh is also on record as favoring limiting the public’s right to use the courts to redress government overreach.But curiously enough or perhaps not so curiously Kavanaugh was treated with kid gloves on those critical issues basically because both major parties are now supportive of the unitary executive concept even if they would not admit that to be the case. Bill Clinton launched cruise missiles attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan on his own authority and involved the US in a war in the Balkans. George W. Bush did the same in approving torture and expanding the war on terror to Iraq and also globally while Barack Obama attacked both the Syrian and Libyan governments and assassinated US citizens abroad all acts of war or war crimes carried out without a congressional declaration of war or without any real pushback by the judiciary.The failure of Congress to carry out its duty to review Kavanaugh’s ability or lack thereof to interpret the constitution impartially was the more important story line in the confirmation process but it was ignored by the media. The other narrative that ran simultaneously the purely political attempt made by the Democrats and some Republicans to destroy Kavanaugh as a person through the exploitation of random claims of sexual assault dating from more than thirty-five years ago was an attempt to discredit the candidate that everyone knew right from the beginning could not be substantiated.This all means that the important issue of Kavanaugh’s likely comportment as a judge was subjected to too little inquiry while his character as evidenced by tales from his past life received far too much attention. Ironically the media which has been frantically searching for an explanation for the breakdown of democracy in the United States has been pillorying the Russians and more recently the Chinese for outside interference in the process while ignoring the intense public dissatisfaction with the government it has been allowed to have by the Establishment which is exemplified by the dystopic reality demonstrated by Kavanaugh. Some Americans would have rejected him based on his merits as a judge but the case was not clearly made. Many instead came to view him as a victim of a vicious personal campaign and that was apparently enough to win confirmation at least as reckoned by the calculus of those in Congress who cast the actual votes. In either case the system failed to produce a good result and we only have our polarized and dysfunctional government to blame for that failure.,1
Best Government Money Can Buy | Freepress.orBest Government Money Can BuVery few Americans know who Sheldon Adelson is and fewer still appreciate that as America’s when he speaks the Republican Party listens. By virtue of his largesse he has been able to direct GOP policy in the Middle East in favor of Israel which might well be regarded as his true home while the United States exists more as a faithful friend that can be produced at intervals whenever Israel finds itself in need of a bit of cash or political cover.Adelson’s recent successes in translating his political donations into policy favorable to Israel have included shifting the US Embassy to Jerusalem cutting aid to Palestinians ending the Iranian nuclear monitoring agreement and closing the Palestine Liberation Organization’s diplomatic office in Washington. All those Trump Administration measures were reportedly worked out privately by Adelson speaking directly with the president.Adelson’s activities in buying politicians reflect what he believes he reportedlythat “there’s no such thing as a Palestinian.” Nor does his world view include much concern for the country that has sheltered him and made him wealthy. He served in the US Army in World War 2 and has said that he as he would rather have worn an Israeli army uniform. He also expressed his desire that his son might become an Israeli Army sniper.Adelson benefits from his exceptional access to the White House to the detriment of actual American interests. A New York Times article “Sheldon Adelson Sees a Lot to Like in Trump’s Washingto” states that he “enjoys a direct line to the president” and meets the president monthly “in private in-person meetings and phone conversations.” He has been delighted with the openly expressed threats emanating from the Administration’s key foreign and national security policy spokesmen regarding Iran. He would like to see the United States go to war with the Iranians to destroy their government and bring about some kind of regime change and judging from recent developments he just might get what he seeks which could easily have catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond.Adelson is somewhat unhinged on the issue of Iran and hasdropping a nuclear bomb on a desert region of the country as a negotiating tactic to show “we mean business” so Washington could then “impose its demands [on Iran] from a position of strength.” If Iran continued to resist Adelson would to drop the next one on Tehran. If Tehran were to be nukedIranians would die which doesn’t bother Adelson one bit. Such a development would in Adelson’s opinion be good for Israel which is his primary concern.Adelson’s power over policy makers is also evident in what the White House does not do. Israeli snipers have shot deadunarmed Arab demonstrators in Gaza without so much as a word of condemnation coming out of Washington. Indeed the Donald Trump Ambassador to Israel David Friedman has gone out of his way to defend the killings and also to support the expansion of the illegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank.to have had a hand in personnel changes in the White House. He has used his money and influence to advance the careers of United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo while also arranging the removal of H.R. McMaster and Rex Tillerson for “being anti-Israeli” and not sufficiently willing to go to war with Iran. Defense Secretary James Mattis the only actual adult remaining in the room when foreign policy is discussed is believed to be the next target for removal.How does Adelson do it? Money talks. He is worth. His fortune came from casinos both in the US and in China which some might consider to be promotion of vice. To buy and maintain the Republican support for right wing Zionist policies he has donated what is for him pocket change $55 million so far this year in support of GOP candidates in the Midterm elections. In 2016 heto the Trump campaign and to other Republicans donating $35 million to the former and $55 million to two top Republican PACs — the Congressional Leadership Fund and the Senate Leadership Fund.In America’s corrupt political culture a monster like Sheldon Adelson can buy both a White House and Congress on behalf of a foreign government for a paltry $150 million or so. It is a reasonable investment for him given his views as through him Israel is able to control a large slice of American foreign policy while also receiving billions of dollars each year from the US Treasury. And for those who think it would be different if the Democrats were in charge think again. The Democrats have their own Adelson. His name is Haim Saban an Israeli-American media magnate whohe is a “one issue guy and my issue is Israel.” He is also the largest individual contributor to the Democratic Party.,1
7 days in … the GOP’s not-so-grand but very old Senate | Freepress.or7 days in … the GOP’s not-so-grand but very old SenatNever before has the Republican Party so explicitly shown its true colors. It is now so far off to the right the Clintons look like raging communists. The all-male Republican membership of the Senate judiciary committee refused to interview a female sexual assault victim themselves. They hired a prosecutor to interrogate the victim and say next to nothing to the accused. Senators whom had previously railed against Trump lost all moderate credibility when they leapt to the defense of a Supreme Court nominee accused of sex crimes and perjury. The entire party has been astoundingly flagrant in its disrespect and disregard for women.The nation’s attention was captured last Thursday when Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate judiciary committee. Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa began the hearing with a very shaky introduction. The 85-year-old mispronounced names completely changed some words and almost choked a few times. If he is too old to read he is too old to serve in the United States Senate. He went through his teens and twenties at a time when the country was segregated and Elvis’s hips were leading kids astray. His political ideology was built before interstates and when women were kept in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant. It is detrimental to the entire country to have him voting on matters from abortion to net neutrality and public education.Grassley just about managed to get through his speech before keeling over and I stopped cringing. However Dianne Feinstein spoke next and she was almost as painful to watch. Feinstein also 85 had a constant tremble in her voice and the papers she was holding shook so violently I thought she was pretending to hold Kavanaugh’s neck. She was predictable and uninspiring which is far less than can be said for the hero of the hour.Dr. Ford went before Kavanaugh presumably so he could have a little extra time to fabricate a story that refuted hers. The Republicans ceded all of their time to sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell; she asked every question from the conservative side and except for Chuck Grassley greeting her in the morning not one Republican senator said anything to her. The official reasoning for that was that they did not want a victim of sexual assault to be interrogated by a bunch of men. Instead they really wanted political safety gained by not personally going after Dr. Ford. They could please their base by having a “tough on crime” prosecutor execute the interrogation but not draw ire from the left and/or be accused of bullying a witness. The plan did not work. Mitchell’s primary aim was to discredit Dr. Ford and create a clear path to confirmation for Kavanaugh. Her questioning failed to remove partisan politics from the process and made the Republicans look even more out of touch. The row of ugly white men staring at Dr. Ford the entire time did not exactly fix their image issues either.Dr. Ford read a truly heartbreaking opening statement informing the world on how she feared for not only her safety but her life when she was attacked by Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. Mitchell never went near the attack itself only focusing on events immediately preceding and succeeding it. She tried to throw doubt on Dr. Ford even knowing Kavanaugh and lost. She suggested the attacker could have been someone else and was embarrassed. She brought out a giant street map and I don’t know I just I cannot describe how ridiculous that was.The Democrats didn’t ask too many questions because there was little else Dr. Ford could offer up and they wanted her to feel believed trusted and valued as a human being. One Democratic question did provide a huge moment though. Dr. Ford was asked how certain she was that Brett Kavanaugh was the man who attacked her. She leaned into the microphone and coolly said “100%.”She shared every detail she remembered and somehow maintained her composure throughout. Not once did she show anger or frustration nor did she flinch at Mitchell’s questions or become overconfident when talking to the Democrats. She gave the Senate and its processes the respect they frankly no longer deserve. Her strength and poise were altogether remarkable.After a break so the senators could pee take stool softeners and put their teeth back in the hearing resumed with Brett Kavanaugh providing testimony. The second he walked into the room the tone and atmosphere changed entirely. His opening statement was full of partisan jabs and conspiracy theories. Every word dripped with contempt and his face could not hide his rage and indignation.Kavanaugh reduced the sex crime accusations against him to supposed political revenge by the Clintons and a “well-funded effort to destroy [his] good name.” Like every contestant on every TV singing contest he also played for the sympathy vote. He told the committee his daughter’s response to sexual assault is prayer then cried when describing how his father kept a schedule.Once the ugly soliloquy had ended under the weight of its own darkness the Republicans proceeded with a gentle chitchat. The Democrats on the other hand actually had a solid performance. They tested the various defenses offered by Kavanaugh and his far-right buddies and they lured him into showing his real personality. Due to inebriation playing a major role in Dr. Ford’s story Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota questioned Kavanaugh on whether he had drunk to the point of blacking out. He quipped that he didn’t know and asked her if she had. When pressed for a straight answer he smugly retorted: “I’m curious if you have.” It was insolent and wholly inappropriate for the venue and occasion.Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island also wanted to know about Kavanaugh’s well-documented history with alcohol. In response to a series of questions Kavanaugh said to Senator Whitehouse: “I like beer I don’t know if you do . . . Do you like beer Senator or not? . . . What do you like to drink?” Kavanaugh wasn’t some punk before a traffic court judge he is a judge on the second-highest court in the land and was talking to United States senators. If my daughter pulled the same faces used the same tone and/or answered serious questions with questions she would be in a world of trouble. It is difficult to see past Kavanaugh leaning back in his chair and sneering at the Democrats but a deeper investigation shows Kavanaugh is a seasoned liar.The Republicans were incensed at Kavanaugh’s yearbook entry being a major focus for the Democrats. Generally I would agree with them. We shouldn’t be held back by silly things we did as kids especially when everyone is an idiot through their teen years. I know I wouldn’t want to be turned down for a job because I threw snowballs at a teacher’s house when I was 14. Yet we’re not talking about some immature act and who Kavanaugh was 36 years ago provides evidence for what he did 36 years ago. The Democratic senators justifiably picked the yearbook entry apart and asked Kavanaugh about almost every detail. He explained away “devil’s triangle” as a drinking game when it’s really an MFM threesome. He said boofing was flatulence even though it’s widely known to be taking drugs anally. He couldn’t completely deny his drinking issues so had to settle for justifications. He said he was a legal drinker in high school even though the age limit in Maryland was raised from 18 to 21 when he was still 17. He admitted to getting drunk but never to the point of not remembering the night before a statement contradicted by Mark Judge’s books and the statements of numerous ex-classmates. Everything Dr. Ford said bolstered her credibility everything Kavanaugh said tainted his.The craziest part of the proceedings was Lindsey Graham’s near-total meltdown. Grassley gave him the floor and he used his time to scold the Democrats for daring to look into a sex crime and to say Kavanaugh’s nomination process was the most despicable thing he’d seen in politics. Actually I agree with him. A credibly accused sexual predator being forced onto the Supreme Court by a bunch of old white men is despicable. Graham 63 was for a long time seen as a more moderate Republican aligning with John McCain on many issues and regularly calling out Trump. His borderline maniacal defense of Brett Kavanaugh erased all of that. Lindsey Graham is now a full-blown bigoted small-minded evil Trump Republican. It was a surprising turn of events but I guess with McCain passing away Graham needs someone to keep him warm at night and maybe Brett Kavanaugh is who he desires.Despite only a few hours with the testifiers and less than 24 hours since the hearing Grassley scheduled a vote on forwarding Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. There wasn’t remotely enough time to weigh what had been said or to investigate further. The Republicans were desperate to push Kavanaugh through and they exposed their lack of belief in Dr. Ford and their opinion that sexual assault does not disqualify someone from holding public office. By scheduling a vote for the very next day the Republicans told all women their pain wasn’t real and that the wishes of the few (evangelicals and the economic 1%) mattered more than the rights of over half the entire population.Anti-Trump Republican Jeff Flake began the Friday vote by stating he would only vote to advance the nomination if the floor vote was delayed for a week so the FBI could investigate Dr. Ford’s story. It was a pathetic attempt at looking good on women’s rights. Neither he nor anyone else on the committee can force the FBI to do anything so he was voting in favor of Kavanaugh with no guarantee of anything in return. There can be no conclusion other than he wants the sexual predator to be on the court for decades to come. The committee voted along party lines and Kavanaugh cleared the first hurdle.Trump was quick to order a new FBI background check so Flake was let off the hook. Reports were soon released accusing the administration of tying the FBI’s hands with the aim of preventing new evidence coming to light. Considering the Bureau works for the president and how determined he is to have Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court we should have no faith in the latest investigation. Even if it is legitimate Mark Judge and the other witnesses aren’t likely to change their stories and there is no physical evidence that will prove Kavanaugh’s guilt beyond any doubt.Some senators are on the fence about the final confirmation vote but with the Republican majority and Pence’s tie-breaking vote Kavanaugh still has a very good chance of becoming a Supreme Court justice. Anyone who votes in his favor is also in favor of rape perjury violence against women and condemning multiple generations to a neo-fascist court determining their futures.The bottom line is that no matter what happens moving forward Brett Kavanaugh shouldn’t be within 1000 miles of the Supreme Court. On the sole issue of his confirmation definitively proving he sexually assaulted Dr. Ford is irrelevant. His right-wing political jibes proved he will not be impartial in his judgments. His anger shows he will not be clear-headed when considering a case and will not react well if a decision doesn’t go his way. His perjury makes him a criminal and criminals should not be judges. As well as not being confirmed for the Supreme Court he should be impeached from his current position.In other news Trump and John Bolton embarrassed the country at the UN General Assembly. Trump claimed his administration has achieved more than any other within the same timeframe. The room erupted into laughter and Trump was genuinely taken aback. Apparently he’s not used to people laughing at him. It’s probably one reason why he’s surrounded by lifelong bootlickers and newfound sycophants (Flake and Graham et al.). John Bolton promised American forces would stay in Syria as long as Iran continued to intervene. He is angling for a larger US presence in the Middle East and is trying to goad Iran into doing something stupid so he can have more people of color blown to pieces. The far-right Republicans (which is now all of them) just want to burn more oil kill more foreigners and justify the massive jobs program that is the Department of Defense.Legislative progress was next to nonexistent last week and I’m sure you’re already familiar with America’s historical relationship with the Kingdom of Morocco so there’s no need for me to write more on that topic.The Republican Party has now lost all claims to the votes of good people. The GOP is entirely made up of lifelong neo-fascists and those who have recently climbed aboard the crazy train. There is no such thing as a moderate Republican anymore and new candidates who join the party will immediately be guilty by association. Every single one of them needs to be kept out of office along with all the dinosaurs of any political persuasion. The country is a school bus on fire and it is being driven off a cliff by conservatives and geriatrics.,1
GOP and Corporate Dems Gain When Democrats Run Against Putin | Freepress.orGOP and Corporate Dems Gain When Democrats Run Against Putirogressives should figure it out. Amplifying the anti-Russia din helps to drown out the left’s core messages for economic fairness equal rights environmental protection diplomacy and so much more. Echoing the racket of blaming Russia for the USA’s severe shortages of democracy plays into the hands of Republicans and corporate Democrats eager to block progressive momentum.When riding on the “Russiagate” bandwagon progressives unwittingly aid political forces that are eager to sideline progressive messages. And with the midterm elections now scarcely 100 days away the torrents ofclaims about Russia keep diverting attention from why it’s so important to defeat Republicans.As a practical matter devoting massive amounts of time and resources to focusing on Russia has reduced capacities to effectively challenge the domestic forces that are assaulting democratic possibilities at home -- with such tactics as state voter ID laws purging of voter rolls and numerous barriers to suppress turnout by people of color.Instead of keeping eyes on the prize some of the Democratic base has been watching and trusting media outlets like MSNBC. An extreme Russia obsession at the network has left precious little airtime to expose and challenge the vast quantity of terrible domestic-policy measures being advanced by the Trump administration every day.Likewise with the U.S. government’s militarism. While some Democrats and Republicans in Congress have put forward legislation to end the active U.S. role in Saudi Arabia’s mass-murderous war on Yemen those efforts face a steeper uphill climb because of MSNBC.This week under the headline “It’s Been Over a Year Since MSNBC Has Mentioned U.S. War in Yeme” journalist Adam Johnson reported for the media watchdog group FAIR about the collapse of journalistic decency at MSNBC under the weight of the network’s Russia Russia Russia obsession. Johnson’s article asks a big-type question: “Why is the No. 1 outlet of alleged anti-Trump #resistance completely ignoring his most devastating war?”The FAIR report says: “What seems most likely is MSNBC has found that attacking Russia from the right on matters of foreign policy is the most elegant way to preserve its ‘progressive’ image while still serving traditional centers of power -- namely the Democratic Party establishment corporate sponsors and their own revolving door of ex-spook and military contractor-funded talking heads.”Corporate media have been exerting enormous pressure on Democratic officeholders and candidates to follow a thin blue party line on Russia. Yet polling shows that few Americans see Russia as a threat to their well-being; they’re far more concerned about such matters as healthcare education housing and overall economic security.The gap between most Americans and media elites is clear in ataken after the Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki which was fiercely condemned by the punditocracy. Asnewspaper reported this week under the headline “Most Americans Back Trump’s Call for Follow-Up Summit With Putin” 54 percent of respondents favored plans for a second summit. “The survey also found that 61 percent of Americans say better relations with Russia are in the best interest of the United States.”Yet most Democratic Party leaders have very different priorities. After investing so much political capital in portraying Putin’s government as an implacable enemy of the United States top Democrats on Capitol Hill are hardly inclined to help thaw relations between the world’s two nuclear superpowers.It would be easy for news watchers to see that the Democratic Party is much more committed to a hard line against Russia than a hard line against the corporate forces imposing extreme economic inequality here at home.National polling underscores just how out of whack and out of touch the party’s top dogs are. Last month the Gallup organization asked: “What do you think is the most important problem facing the country today?” Thewere telling. “Situation with Russia” came in at below one-half of 1 percent.The day after the Helsinki summit thereported: “Citing polls and focus groups that have put Trump and Russia far down the list of voter priorities Democratic strategists have counseled candidates and party leaders for months to discuss ‘kitchen table’ issues. Now after a remarkable 46-minute news conference on foreign soil where Trump stood side by side with a former KGB agent to praise his ‘strong’ denials of election interference and criticize the FBI those strategists believe the ground may have shifted.”Prominent corporate Democrats who want to beat back the current progressive groundswell inside their party are leading the charge. Jim Kessler a senior vice president at the “centrist” Third Way organization was quick toafter the summit: “It got simple real fast. I’ve talked to a lot of Democrats that are running in purple and red states and districts who have said that Russia rarely comes up back home and I think that has now changed.”The Democratic National Committee and other official arms of the party keep sending out Russia-bashing emails to millions of people on a nearly daily basis. At times the goals seem to involve generating and exploiting manic panic.At the end of last week as soon as the White House announced plans (later postponed) for Vladimir Putin to meet with President Trump in Washington this fall the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fired off a mass email -- from “RUSSIA ALERT (via DCCC)” -- declaring that the Russian president “must NOT be allowed to set foot in our country.” The email strained to conflate a summit with Russian interference in U.S. elections. “We cannot overstate how dangerous this is” the DCCC gravely warned. And: “We need to stop him at all costs.”For Democrats who move in elite circles running against Putin might seem like a smart election move. But for voters worried about economic insecurity and many other social ills a political party obsessed with Russia is likely to seem aloof and irrelevant to their lives.Norman Solomon is the national coordinator of the online activist group RootsAction.org and the executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Reviving the Spirit of '68 | Freepress.orReviving the Spirit of '6I was a hippie/bicycle delivery boy living in San Francisco when the Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago fifty years ago so I absorbed the chaos the police riot from half a continent away but I knew with absolute certainty that the nation was changing and I was part of it.We were in the violent spasm of transition. How long would it last? MLK and RFK as they called for peace and sanity and civil rights for all had just been assassinated. This was the God of War turning its vengeance inward.A year earlier I had been part of the march on the Pentagon. At one point a group of soldiers charged us as we stood on the grounds next to the building and I got clonked in the head by a rifle butt. Later as we sat in I felt with sudden certainty that Lyndon Johnson was going to emerge from the Pentagon and declare an end to the Vietnam War. Uh . . . that didn’t happen.Instead I eventually just got up and left. When I returned to Kalamazoo Michigan where I was in college the first thing I did was drop out. Apparently I wanted to remove myself entirely from the infrastructure or normal middle-class existence and join others in creating something new.As I read about the chaos in Chicago at the convention — the thousands of cops and National Guardsmen and U.S. troops storming the protesters whacking them with their batons throwing them into paddy wagons as the pro-war consensus (epitomized by the grimace on the face of Chicago’s mayor Richard J. Daley) held tight to the reins of power — I felt myself quietly retreat back into my own life. The “movement” wasn’t going to remake America. Or rather idealism all by itself wasn’t going to bring about the world I had envisioned with such certainty as I sat on the steps of the Pentagon.I didn’t surrender my idealism; I didn’t turn into a cynic. But I shifted my focus to my own life and returned to school. Half a century later . . .I gape in awe at how little has changed.“The reality is that the war has created the world’s worst humanitarian catastrophe today”wrote recently in The Guardian. “Three-quarters of the population some 22 million Yemenis require humanitarian assistance and protection. About 8.4 million people hang on the brink of starvation and another 7 million lie malnourished. Since 2015 more than 28000 thousand people have been killed or injured and many thousands more have died from causes exacerbated by war such as a cholera epidemic that has afflicted more than a million people and claimed over 2300 lives. At least one child dies every 10 minutes from causes linked to the war according to the United Nations.”changed — the opposite of what I had anticipated in 1967 as I sat on the steps of the Pentagon or in 1968 as I silently cheered the protesters demanding that the Democratic Party become a party of peace.The war in Yemen which the U.S. is making possible with billions of dollars in weapons sales to the Saudi coalition is barely even news. Neither are the wars — at leastof them — in which the U.S. is directly participating including Iraq (15 years and counting) and Afghanistan (17 years and counting). I fear the forces the antiwar protesters were confronting fifty years ago have made a shift in keeping with their deepest interests: not to “win” the wars but simply to make sure they continue.Even Donald Trump was shocked by this: “When Trump announced . . . that he was ordering a new approach to the war” threported last March about Afghanistan “he said he realized ‘the American people are weary of war without victory.’ He said his instinct was to pull out but that after consulting with aides he decided to seek ‘an honorable and enduring outcome.’ He said that meant committing more resources to the war giving commanders in the field more authority and staying in Afghanistan for as long as it takes.”In other words he was pulled back into line — that is back into lyin’. Glory glory hallelujah. In America clichés rule. We may bomb children and (even more to the point) manufacture and sell the bombs that take out school buses etc. etc. etc. but we still pull out our clichés about freedom and honor and such stale as they may be on a moment’s notice.America’s journey to its Orwellian present-day reality in which wars are endlessly expanding background noise (as opposed to news) essentially began in the tumultuous late ’60s when peace consciousness had seized much of the nation. While LBJ did not declare the end of the Vietnam War the war eventually did end — in defeat dishonor and disgrace leaving behind a shattered country (a million or more dead an environment despoiled with Agent Orange and unexploded ordnance) and countless U.S. vets spiritually and physically wounded. The American public was weary not of war without victory but of war itself. This was called Vietnam Syndrome and it was profoundly troubling to the political status quo.It took several decades but Militarized America did achieve its one and only post-World War II victory. It defeated Vietnam Syndrome. Step one was eliminating the draft which freed the public from any personal risk — and thus any real stake — in future wars leaving only a poverty draft to fill the ranks and who cares about them?Ronald Reagan was forced to fight proxy wars against the commies in Central America but his successor George H.W. Bush declared a victory over Vietnam Syndrome after Gulf War I. A decade later his son as we know launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq which having accomplished none of their alleged aims nonetheless continue with no end in sight two presidents later. Victory no longer matters. A seemingly rational mission no longer matters. Clichés and a bloated military budget are enough.Fifty years ago the country was in tumult about the war in Vietnam and millions of people wanted to reshape the Democratic Party into a party of peace. The War Machine which owned (owns) both parties held fast and tough. Billy clubs won. The media surrendered.But we the people have not surrendered. We were outmaneuvered gerrymandered removed from the voting roster but we have not surrendered. Is the spirit of ’68 coming back to life in the Trump era as evinced by an upsurge in progressive electoral victories? The War God is ruthless and clever and will not give up. Neither should we.,1
John McCain Funeral Transcript Leaked | Freepress.orJohn McCain Funeral Transcript LeakeToday Senator John McCain is being buried together with the young woman who leaked the transcript of these funeral proceedings. John would have been honored to know that he was posthumously connected to such swift and cost-saving justice in protection of our national security — which I think should more than compensate for his being buried together with someone he would have referred to as lowlife scum. Can I get a Praise Jesus?John McCain and I worked together with many of you and I believe every single media outlet that has been permitted into this holy cathedral today to launch and prolong a war in which we did so much damage to the world in so many ways that my own son was killed by our open burning of all kinds of toxic waste and I’ve barely even registered that fact. Hell it’ll be years before it occurs to me that a lot of Iraqi people probably died too. I’m sorry I shouldn’t use that word in a church. I mean Iraqi lowlife scum.John was my friend and a genuine humanitarian. I’ll tell you a story. [Shouts of “Noooo! Nooooo!”] A short one. It’s a short one. I once showed John my plan to cut Iraq up into three different countries. And I could tell that John thought it was the worst idea since the United Nations but — and this tells you how much he cared about humanity — he told me he’d back my nutty scheme because he was my friend. The world has lost a true statesman who certainly would have made a better president than some er some I mean sometimes I say too much. Please welcome our next speaker.John McCain was a serious public servant and a jokester. I’ve never told this story before. Remember that slideshow I made where I was hunting under my desk for weapons of mass destruction? I couldn’t keep a straight face because — even though you couldn’t see it John was hiding under the desk holding up my Saddam Hussein voodoo doll making it dance around and sing. I think it was singing John’s favorite Beach Boys song. You know the one Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb Bomb . . . Wow did John love bombs. You know Ronald Reagan banned the Beach Boys from the Fourth of July in Washington but John was never a partisan or an idea tree I mean idea log. He crossed party wires. You know he himself bombed thousands of Vietgooks before being taken hostage and held for ransom by the terrorists. I think about that sometimes when I’m painting myself in the bathtub and I remember how many times John and I pretended to ban torture even though it was already a crime when actually we were creating loopholes for the CIA to do the tough job that it’s tough to put food on your family. It’s . . . no . . . no Dick I have not turned the earpiece off I’m just not listening to your fat . . . uh somebody else is up now.My fellow Americans John McCain is less appreciated by non-Americans and that tells you how far we have left still to go in bringing the world up to a better understanding. Let me be clear John was willing to do what needed to be done even if it made him enemies. He embraced terrorists jihadists and Nazis as needed to destabilize the world and fuel anti-American hostility or failing that sell well so many weapons you wouldn’t believe it. One time I promised Senator McCain that we would heavily bomb Syria and then I backed off. And how did John react? Did he threaten to rip off my head and defecate down my throat? Well yes yes he did. But he didn’t actually do it. Because John was a true American and that’s not who we are. And that’s a key lesson I learned from John over the years: almost nothing we regularly do is who we are. And I stand here before you today for everything I never did. Miss me yet?Senator McCain cannot be replaced but he will need to be. With some people you just have to say the word Nazi and they’ll abandon the cause of freedom. The current U.S. president follows John McCain’s legacy in working beyond that unfair taboo. [Loud Boos!] Oh shut up. You will not replace us! And what’s with sticking me up here between a Muslim and a Jew is this a joke? I was his friend! I was . . . [scuffle].I’ll be brief. I believe that we should rename this cathedral for Senator John McCain and I believe that when we visit here we should pray to him. I believe — What the?Step aside. Loser. Am I right? You people don’t love John McCain for all the bad bad ideas these losers are praising him for. You love him because he had a little spat with me just like the Fake News. Right? I’m the only one the only one who can make you love John McCain. You should be thanking me. That’s right. Where are you going? Throw those people out who are leaving! I’ll pay your legal fees! Do it!,1
The Dems could win if they Stood for Something | Freepress.orThe Dems could win if they Stood for SomethinThe Democrats have been in turmoil for the last half century and then some when they abandoned their racist base and supported the civil rights movement.Revved up by the spirit of the ’60s the party began opening itself to further change even daring to push beyond the financial interests of its controlling oligarchs and declare an opposition to war. “I have no secret plan for peace. I have a public plan” George McGovern said during his 1972 presidential campaign . . . and that was that. After his crushing defeat at the hands of Richard Nixon and his “Southern strategy” the Dems quietly retreated. Their prevailing slogan ever since whispered subconsciously has been: We don’t stand for all that much.The Dems are now Republican lite. They don’t have the will to disrupt anything that seems tried and true — such as for instance American exceptionalism and bloated militarism.Even in the wake of George W. Bush’s disastrous invasion of Iraq the Democrats opted for wimpiness as opposed to courage and sanity. They didn’t dare speak against it or propose anything but a military path to “peace.” In his 2004 campaign John Kerry stood thus on the war as stated on his website: “The hard truth is that we know that more lives will be lost until the mission is truly accomplished.”And what was that mission? “To create a stable democracy in Iraq.” Those were the words of Kerry’s media spokesperson with whom I had an enormously frustrating conversation in the wake of a fundraising call I had received from the Kerry campaign.That war is still quietly going on fourteen years later. So are a few others. The planet is hemorrhaging refugees thanks largely to these wars and to the savage inequality that remains the legacy of colonialism. We still have thousands of nuclear weapons ready on command to destroy the world. And climate change is stirring up chaotic conditions across the planet.Now more than ever the whole of humanity needs leaders who can who can envision and articulate a global transition beyond war and dominance beyond environmental exploitation beyond policies and practices that dehumanize part of us and cluelessly continue more of the same.The Republicans who know how to win elections have served us up a president who is for better and for worse pretty much the exact opposite of this. Donald Trump doesn’t articulate a coherent vision for a sustainable and peaceful future but he does mock the political status quo that has delivered us to our point of no return.More precisely what he mocks is the mask called political correctness which has hidden the racism we became aware of fifty-plus years ago which has continued ever so quietly to drive much of American politics. When Trump and his supporters cry “Make America Great Again” they see an America free of the constraints of political correctness.Trump brings us an America once again free to hate belittle and stereotype . . . somebody. If not African-Americans then Mexicans and Muslims and well Native Americans.This of course is Trump talking about arch-nemesis Elizabeth Warren at a rally of wildly cheering supporters last week in Montana. Oh to be free of political correctness!“I promise you I’ll do this you know those little kits they sell on television for two dollars. . . . I’m going to get one of those little DNA kits and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims that she’s of Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones” Trump joked to the delight of his overwhelmingly homogeneous audience.“We will take that little kit . . . but we have to do it gently because we’re in the Me Too generation so we have to be very gentle. And we will very gently take that kit and we will slowly toss it to her. Hoping it doesn’t hit her and injure her arm even though it only weighs about two ounces.”The words are remarkably juvenile and clueless the spew of a bully-bigot who happily mocks an entire people in order to toss a verbal dart at a political enemy. The laughter and applause from the crowd were I’m certain due far less to any animosity toward Warren than to sheer delight at the freedom to stereotype. Make America Great Again!This is the same president who in May said of immigrants: “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These areAs Annie Linskey noted in the: “And with Trump pontification becomes policy.”Shortly afterward news of the Trump administration’s treatment of asylum seekers at the Mexican border — the separation of children from their families putting children in “cages” — went global. And suddenly the treatment of immigrants dominates the news. The wars we wage the horrors visited on civilian populations have faded into invisibility but a national compassion and outrage have broken loose about Trump’s border policies.It’s almost as though this is a real democracy at least on that issue.All of which brings me back to the Democrats who have one choice only in this year’s midterm elections and in the presidential election of 2020: Put forth real values and run on a commitment to real change a la the young Democratic Socialist who won a shocking upset victory in her congressional primary in the Bronx two weeks ago and then this week won a second primary in her neighboring district as a write-in candidate. She wasn’t a candidate but she won anyway.This is what’s possible for Democrats who refuse to campaign as centrists: that is as lite Republicans.Robert Koehler is an award-winning Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer.

57 Unpatriotic Ways the Corp/Dems Have Enthroned Trumputin | Freepress.or57 Unpatriotic Ways   the Corp/Dems   Have Enthroned TrumputiAlan Dershowitz at a hotel in Kiev Ukraine in 2011. (photo: Sergei Chuzavkov/AP)s we celebrate our nation’s birth and organize to once again overthrow an illegitimate tyrant we might pity Trump’s classic liberal enabler Al Dershowitz.The pitiful self-promoting professor is being horribly snubbed by his fellow liberal neighbors on Martha’s Vineyard because he now supports Trump.The ordeal must be every bit as painful as being separated from one’s children at the Mexican border.But all whining aside it should be clear that The Donald’s primary enablers (alongside his mob boss Vladimir Putin) have been self-proclaimed “liberals” far more important than Dershowitz – namely Nancy Pelosi and her Corporate Democrats.Their corruption and incompetence got him into the White House in the first place. And he can’t continue to rule without them.Let’s count a mere 57 of the ways:1) Pelosi Chuck Schumer and the Corporate Democrats are nearly all multi-millionaires locked into the corporate oligarchy;2) Hillary Clinton lumped all us social democrats into that “basket of deplorables”;3) While banning young charismatic progressive blood from the party Pelosi (78) is clearly more concerned with her personal retirement than overcoming Trump’s fascist putsch;4) Like Dershowitz the Corp/Dem elite is far more comfortable with Trump in the White House than with Bernie Sanders whose millions of energized social-democratic activists held the key to winning the 2016 election had Hillary Clinton not trashed them;5) The Corp/Dem cabal offers no alternative vision (can anyone tell us exactly what the Democratic Party stands for?) pumping out endless fundraising emails complaining about Trump but providing zero leadership toward a just diverse eco-Solartopian world that might sustain a focused longterm grass-roots movement;6) As demonstrated by Matt Taibbi and others the Corp/Dem Party has become a hollow fundraising scam choosing candidates based on their cash flow relying on fear of Trump to rake in the dough while failing to effectively oppose him;7) When Trump attacked Rep. Maxine Waters with racist anti-feminist bigotry Pelosi said little;8) But when Maxine promised to fight back Pelosi attacked HER for being “uncivil”;9) The Corp/Dems have issued no major public statements of matching intensity denouncing the death threats being leveled at Maxine as they are being encouraged by Trump (“Be careful what you wish for Max”);10) Trump’s multiple bankruptcies reflect an infamous lack of business ability managerial competence and moral stature;11) Trump’s core financial base has depended since the 1980s on his money-laundering cash for the Russian mob as amply documented by Republican investigator David Cay Johnston among others;12) But the Corp/Dems and mainstream media have almost completely ignored Trump’s mob roots even as they extend through his New York upbringing and into his ruble-based cash flow;13) This includes Trump’s being raised by his overtly racist slumlord father Fred a proud KKK supporter who was memorialized as a vicious bigot by the legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie;14) As a New York slumlord and shady builder according to Johnston Fred Trump was enmeshed with at least two major mob families without whom he could not have poured concrete or built his hell-hole tenements a reality studiously ignored by the Corp/Dems;15) Corp/Dems have ignored the fact that Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement was hastened by his son’s job as a rare American banker still willing to do business with the perennially bankrupt Donald;16) While Corp/Dems endlessly obsess on likely collusion between the Trump campaign and Putin and desperately hang on every snippet from Mueller they ignore Trump’s Russian mob connections dating back to the 1980s through which Putin owned him FINANCIALLY even aside from any blackmail videos or the details of their 2016 mega-fraud;17) While failing to raise that reality the Corp/Dems also ignore the fact that no matter what role the Russians may have played in it the 2016 election was in fact stolen by homegrown GOP operatives cycling back most importantly to 2000 and 2004;17) Al Gore won the 2000 election by more than 500000 popular votes nationwide but has never publicly confronted the fact that he actually “lost” the presidency to Florida Governor Jeb Bush brother of the candidate Shrub setting a devastating precedent for Corp/Dem acquiescence to domestically stolen elections;18) Gov. Jeb used a computer program called ChoicePoint (as revealed by Greg Palast) to strip Florida registration rolls of more than 90000 citizens nearly all of them black and Hispanic in an election allegedly decided by 537 votes;19) Gore has never publicly faced this massive Jim Crow disenfranchisement or campaigned to protect the voter rolls in ensuing elections (like the one upcoming in 2018);20) John Kerry has never publicly faced the stripping of some 300000 citizens from voter rolls in Ohio 2004 (where Bush allegedly won by 118775);21) Hillary Clinton has never publicly contested the 2016 vote theft perpetrated by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach using a CrossCheck program that stripped a million or more voters from the key Electoral College states that put Trump in the White House;22) In 2000 2004 and 2016 easily hackable electronic voting machines (as revealed by Bev Harris) helped flip votes from Gore and Kerry to Bush in Florida 2000 Ohio 2004 and elsewhere – and from Clinton to Trump in Wisconsin and Michigan 2016 etc. – with zero protest from the Corp/Dems;23) These stripped voter rolls and rigged voting machines flipped as many as six US Senate seats in 2014 and 2016 giving Republicans control of the Senate Supreme Court etc. with no word from the Corp/Dems;24) These same machines helped flip a thousand federal state and local elections to the GOP during the eight years of the Obama presidency without a peep from the Corp/Dems;24) In Florida 2000 Gore filed a limited recount demand when a full-state recount might have made the difference;25) After Ohio 2004 Kerry’s Corp/Dems did nothing to help a successful federal court filing by Attorney Bob Fitrakis and others for a full state-wide recount (I was a plaintiff in this case);26) When confronted with a federal court settlement demanding all ballot records from the Ohio 2004 presidential election 56 of Ohio’s 88 counties claimed their records were (illegally) missing with no protest from the Corp/Dems (and no criminal prosecution of any kind);27) When Green candidate Jill Stein won a court decision green-lighting a recount for Michigan 2016 where Trump allegedly won by 10000 votes but more than 70000 came in with no presidential preference (primarily in Detroit and Flint) Hillary Clinton’s lawyers killed that recount and let Trump walk away with that state’s electoral votes;28) When Green attorneys including Fitrakis found massive irregularities in Wisconsin 2016 including an illegal refusal to make public the source coding for electronic voting machines Clinton and her Corp/Dems ignored the proceedings and again let Trump walk away with that state’s electoral votes;29) In addition to Michigan and Wisconsin Pennsylvania North Carolina and Florida’s electoral votes could have denied Trump the presidency but Clinton’s Corp/Dems refused to support any meaningful investigations or legal actions where voter registrations were stripped and electronic ballot flipping was rampant;30) When the Congressional Black Caucus united in January 2001 in Constitutional opposition to seating Florida’s Electoral College delegation then-Vice President Al Gore blocked the challenge and strong-armed the Senate into killing any meaningful investigation of how Florida’s electoral votes – and thus the presidency – were stolen;31) In the 18 years since his winning the popular vote in 2000 Gore has never helped organize launch or fund (he is a multi-multi-millionaire) an effective public campaign to abolish the Electoral College;32) Some 200000 Democrats voted for Bush in Florida 2000 and Gore lost New Hampshire and his home state of Tennessee (either could have given him the presidency) but the Corp/Dems still rant at consumer advocate Ralph Nader for daring to run;33) Gore repeatedly refused Nader’s invitations to meet during the 2000 campaign;34) As a US senator Gore had voted to approve Clarence Thomas to the US Supreme Court for which Thomas “repaid” him by deciding the infamous 5-4 Bush v. Gore suit that stopped the Florida 2000 recount;35) Using Dark Money from the Koch Brothers GOP activists outfoxed the Corp/Dems during 2010’s redistricting process and gerrymandered a structural margin in the Congress and statehouses that the Corp/Dems still may be unable to overcome;36) In 2018 along with the Corp/Dems’ lack of leadership and vision the Republicans still have the tools to steal most federal state and local elections essentially unopposed;37) Thanks in part to Gore’s inaction the Corp/Dems have failed to eliminate the Electoral College which could guarantee Trumputin’s return to office in 2020;And at the economic roots:38) In the mid-1980s as Trump began laundering Russian mob money Bill and Hillary Clinton sold the Democratic Party to Goldman Sachs and Wall Street;38) The Clintons’ “New Democrats” escalated the Drug War trashed the poor gutted Wall Street regulations perpetrated NAFTA expanded the death penalty launched a racist attack against rapper Sister Soulja imposed “three strikes and you’re out” bombed Yugoslavia over the objections of local nonviolent activists and more;39) The Clintons inherited two of history’s hugest financial windfalls – the end of the Cold War and the computer revolution – but rather than pursue social justice they accelerated the shift of wealth from the general population to the super-rich whose ranks they soon joined;40) Through eight years in office the Clintons failed to enact a single lasting program to benefit America’s working/middle class helping set the stage for Trump’s fake populism (they did however spark a national debate on oral sex);41) Nearly all Congressional Dems supported George W. Bush’s repressive Patriot Act and his destabilizing attack on Iraq;42) Despite two full terms in office except for Obamacare Barack Obama enacted no major lasting programs to benefit America’s working/middle class thus accelerating the gap between rich and the rest of us and further setting the stage for Trump’s fake populism;43) BY CONTRAST: Facing a massive bank-based financial crisis in 1933 Franklin Roosevelt confronted the banks won meaningful reforms and enacted New Deal social programs that built a grassroots Democratic Party base that lasted a generation;44) Facing a massive bank-based financial crisis in 2009 Barack Obama handed the bankers (who thanks to the Clintons now owned the Democratic Party) a fake money bailout in the range of $7000000000000 demanded no meaningful reforms massively accelerated the gap between the rich and the rest of us and enacted (except for Obamacare) no significant programs to aid the American working/middle class thus prompting the formation of the Tea Party and paving the way for Trump’s fake populism;45) While kinda/sorta withdrawing from Iraq Obama prolonged our worthless war in Afghanistan’s “Graveyard of Empires” killing thousands and wasting trillions helping to pave the way for Trump’s fake populism;46) Primarily to protect the petro-dollar Obama and Secretary of State Clinton assaulted Libya slaughtered its Prime Minister and further destabilized North Africa and the Middle East across to Afghanistan pushing millions into a mass migration that’s now destabilized much of Europe;47) As America’s first African-American president Obama did little for communities of color heightening economic tensions and paving the way for Trump’s manipulative bigotry;48) While establishing the Dreamer Program Obama perpetrated mass deportations paving the way for Trump’s own horrific assault on the Hispanic community;49) Constitutional lawyer Obama’s illegal attacks on whistleblowers paved the way for Trump’s repressive apparatus today;50) Despite his green rhetoric Obama’s “all of the above” energy policies slowed the transition to a 100% renewable-based Solartopian energy supply that could have provided jobs for millions more Americans while accelerating the fight against climate change;51) Despite gargantuan losses sustained by the nuke power industry and its role as a major source for global warming Obama’s frail support for renewables and his $8.3 billion guaranteed federal loan to America’s last reactor project – at Vogtle Georgia – set the foundation for Trump’s “I love coal and nukes” bailouts to come;52) Obama eventually opposed the Dakota Pipeline but his sluggish response to the green anti-fossil/nuke resistance slowed the movement against global warming;53) Obama and Hillary’s support for fracking has made it easy for Trump to do the same;54) Support for massive nuke bailouts by Corp/Dems like New York governor Andrew Cuomo and Ohio representatives Marcia Fudge Marcy Kaptur and Tim Ryan continue to let dying obsolete money-losing nuke reactors pollute the planet warm the atmosphere and cripple economic growth and job production;55) Despite continued bitterness over how Bernie Sanders and the millions of (mostly young) social democrats who rallied behind him got shafted the Corp/Dems continue to resist meaningful reform of the party and nation;56) Victorious young progressives like New York’s Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez offer hope for a revived Democratic Party run by energetic young social democrats with a blue-green vision and the legs to get there;57) But nothing real can happen until the corrupt comatose Clinton-Gore-Kerry-Pelosi-Schumer-Cuomo Corp/Dems wake up or move over.There is of course much more.But above all a revived Democratic party that can effectively oppose Trump demands an exciting collective vision that’s worth fighting for.In this new century the Corp/Dems have lost the presidency they legitimately won three times and thrown away a thousand other elected offices. They still have done nothing to confront the stripping of the voter rolls flipping of electronic voting machines machinations of the Electoral College. They perform poorly in office and offer zero real vision that might excite an electorate desperate to remove Trump but lacking a real opposition party with which to do it.In a world dominated by millionaires and billionaires where elections have devolved to “One Dollar One Vote” the Corp/Dems offer no hope.So now it’s up to a grassroots movement of rising green social democrats.To overthrow Trump we must first overcome the old Corp/Dem hacks.Original at Reader supported News:,1
7 days in … 2016 | ColumbusFreePress.co7 days in … 201An amazing amount of progress has been made over the past month or so. America has catapulted itself all the way from the 1990s to 2016. The furthest-right elements of both major parties were again successful in the primaries. Another woman is seeking a powerful job on the back of behaving like the worst men. North Korea continues to consume headlines. Not even two years of an irredeemable president and declining enthusiasm on the left could convince our national leaders to change.Four states held primary elections last week. Ohio West Virginia North Carolina and Indiana went to the polls to select who will battle for office in November. There were no results to excite or inspire genuine progressives. As in the year of the Donald Republicans competed to be the most disgraceful candidate and in many cases the worst-of-the-worst won. The Democratic Party forced out progressives before the primaries and went medieval on those who dared to stay in the race.Although the incumbent Republican Party is extremely conservative outsiders were running against a Washington machine they saw as too soft on their issues. In North Carolina Robert Pittenger a three-term congressman lost to a Southern Baptist preacher who supported Cruz then Trump in 2016. The race was decided on the issues of fiscal responsibility and blind double-digit IQ faith. America let alone the world needs another religious zealot in power like a hole in the head. A Southern Baptist no less is guaranteed to embolden more bigots and prohibit social progress. Pittenger’s loss mirrors Rubio’s defeat at the hands of Trump two years ago: a right-wing bigot losing to an incredibly far-right idiot.In Indiana multimillionaire Mike Braun beat two congressmen to challenge Democrat Joe Donnelly for his senate seat. All three candidates boasted of close ties to the Trump agenda but Braun edged it with both money and an outsider reputation. As always money wins elections and somehow many rural conservative voters still believe Trump is in DC to “drain the swamp.”Republican Jim Renacci was selected to take on Ohio’s Sherrod Brown in the general election. Support for him was somewhat soft so Brown’s seat is one the Democrats should be confident of keeping. Conservatives love to dumb down the country via the courts so they are usually enthusiastic about controlling the United States Senate and its ability to confirm judges. A tepid turnout for Renacci could be a sign of him not being fascist enough for primary voters or the RNC putting its resources into what it views as more winnable races.On the Democratic side the usual small-picture centrist-corporate candidates won the primaries. Joe Manchin will be on the ballot to remain as Senator for West Virginia guaranteeing the Republican leadership two votes from West Virginia next year. Richard Cordray a man who loves gun violence and debt-ridden hospital patients bested Dennis Kucinich and will face-off against Mike DeWine to become Ohio’s next governor. On a more positive note of twenty open races that had female candidates seventeen were won by women. It is a more encouraging number than in previous years but we should not get too excited just yet. We need and want more women in office to bring compassion and sanity to politics. If those women are typical Democrats and work for huge corporations while selling out people of color and the poor their gender doesn’t matter. A new generation of Heidi Heitkamps and Debbie Wasserman Schultzes won’t be progress. On that front we just have to hold out and see if the Democratic Party really is making any moves out to the left.This November you will have two sometimes three options. Your first will be a racist homophobic science-ignoring money worshipping Trump Republican. The next choice will be a Democrat who isn’t racist but will do nothing to combat racism. They will say climate change is real but will do very little about it. They will say everyone deserves healthcare but will refuse to provide it to them. Then in some races you will be able to vote for a Green who just about managed to drag themselves onto the ballot. If you are progressive you need to wake up to the fact electoral politics is a waste of time and that grassroots activism and citizens’ initiatives are what deserve your time and money.Gina Haspel’s nomination for CIA Director is on shaky ground. John McCain told his colleagues to reject her and a few purple state senators are still on the fence. There have been far too many individuals who have said it is time for a woman to run the agency. However Director Haspel would be no better than the men who have preceded her just as a President Hillary would have been just as bad as every other overcompensating male president. Haspel ran a torture site so clearly has no problem with extrajudicial actions (anyone remember “We came we saw he died?”). We are way past the due date for female leaders who are chosen for their positions on issues instead of what’s between their thighs.Three more American prisoners were released from North Korea. It provided a huge boost to all sides before the upcoming summit between the US and North Korea. Trump can tout a diplomatic victory South Korea has enhanced its international reputation and North Korea has shown it is becoming more trustworthy. The story deservedly received plenty of media coverage but there is still more discussing the possible pitfalls of negotiating with Kim Jong-un and how the meeting may not even go ahead. No different to a couple of years ago North Korea is being sold as a dangerous rogue nation that needs to be dealt with immediately. Some positive American press could go a long way in producing successful results from all diplomatic efforts. A handshake and a signing ceremony wouldn’t sell as many newspapers or ad slots as war but they would create a hell of a lot more peace.Another faux enemy has also remained in the news. Iran was a focus of national security debates and discussions during the 2016 elections and is again grabbing Trump’s attention. Last week he confirmed the United States’ position to pull out of the nuclear deal. Contrary to popular belief it doesn’t have to be a catastrophic decision. The other signatories have already guaranteed their continuing support for the deal and America’s involvement isn’t needed for every single international action. Other countries are more than capable of monitoring Iran’s nuclear program. They do not need America to be the world’s policeman and are headed for disaster if they wait for it to take action. The US government can’t even fix small domestic issues so how can it possibly be expected to single-handedly create world peace and end climate change? We should just see this episode as yet another petty decision of a thoroughly inept administration.The lessons of 2016 have not been learned. Pathetic incumbents are running on the same platforms and new candidates are trying to drag their parties out to the right. Progressives have almost nobody to vote for and their issues are going to disappear for at least another two years. Those who want to stay active and make real progress happen for their communities should stop volunteering for politicians and go work for existing groups or start their own. They should donate to food banks or green energy enterprises rather than sellouts who will take the money and create cringeworthy attack ads. It would be better to knock on doors and deliver much-needed supplies than knock on doors and regurgitate tiresome talking points. This week has proven establishment politicians have not earned progressive support.Can the Green New Deal save the planet?The Cleveland School of Cannabis opens Columbus locatioThe real reason why Charter School apologists bully Columbus City School,1
Why Ocasio-Cortez’ Platform Is So Great | Freepress.orWhy Ocasio-Cortez’ Platform Is So GreaAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ platform is dramatically better than many may realize. It tackles the greatest evil in existence in a way that no other big-2 congressional candidate’s website does and which most do not even mention. And in doing so it makes serious much of the rest of her socialist platform in a way that even presidential candidate Bernie Sanders did not — a way promoted by the peace movement the Poor People’s Campaign and Black Lives Matter.War and war preparations eat up 60% of the funding that Congress members decide on each year. Most candidates including most progressives refuse to mention that even while (in some cases) proposing to somehow fund massive human and environmental programs. When he ran for president Bernie Sanders was willing to accept the endlessly repeated label of “Tax Increaser” rather than say he’d cut a small fraction of the military to pay for everything he wanted.By labeling her foreign policy platform “A Peace Economy” Ocasio-Cortez using a phrase popular with the peace movement makes the financial connection without shying away from the immoral and criminal and counter-productive character of war. Thethat war endangers rather than protecting erodes rights militarizes police and society destroys the natural environment directly kills and injures and traumatizes and harms millions and — on top of that — does the most damage through the diversion of resources from where they could do good. War is the only place where enough money sits with which to try to protect the environment or to guarantee education or retirement or other basic rights. Candidates who do not mention war spending are not serious about the things they do mention. Many like are in the pay of weapons makers as well as just about every other corporate interest.But there are exceptions you say! There are progressive leaders! There is The Resistance! Is there? Elizabeth Warren’stells us right at the top that some wars are “unavoidable” or in the “national interest.” Her top priority is that wars be paid for up-front rather than creating debt. In the next breath she’s bragging about weapons production in Massachusetts. Warren wants war-plus that is: militarism AND diplomacy. She moves on to support for imperialism in the Pacific and fear-mongering over North Korea justifying troop presence because of existing troop presence plus “economic interests.” Offering hypocritical accusations against China as well as North Korea as examples of her desired “diplomacy” Warren proposes militarism plus diplomacy plus sanctions (a very diplomatic tool don’t you know) as the three-part answer.Warren jumps to pushing Russiagate propaganda declaring that Russia “hacked” Democratic party emails revealing the DNC’s slanting of its primaries against Bernie Sanders (although she doesn’t mention that that is what they revealed) and declaring this action to be (1) fact because “intelligence” agencies say so and (2) an “attack.” But before you can take in the WWIII significance Warren is on to demonizing Iran and backing deadly sanctions there and supporting U.S. wars in Iraq Syria and Afghanistan. Despite massive public pressure to improve Warren’s position on Palestine remains pathetic and delusional including imagining that some geographic location remains for a second state in a two-state “solution.”To her credit Warren supports concrete steps to reduce nuclear weapons. But she concludes her platform with more unproven and hypocritical accusations against Russia and the very dangerous and reckless leveling of threats against anyone engaged in “cyberattacks.”Well sure you say there are always exceptions. Warren is an outlier one of those rare progressives who like the Women’s March the Climate March the March for Our Lives MSNBC the DNC and almost every Democratic member of Congress has accidentally missed out on understanding what war and peace are all about. Still she has the best intentions and with a little help and only a small reduction in she’d be just as great as say Bernie Sanders.But have you read Bernie Sanders’? He too opens by proposing that war is sometimes necessary which is. Then he lists wars he opposed the start of and did little to try to end and wars he supported the start of came belatedly to regret and did little to try to end. His top priority is that wars be fought by and funded by a coalition of countries. To his credit he proposes a shift of some unspecified degree somewhat away from militarism and somewhat toward peaceful foreign relations. But he views the cost of war through U.S. troops and U.S. dollars never mentioning the vast majority of the victims of U.S. wars. And he goes on about how attacking Afghanistan was justified as an act of revenge (which is not legal moral effective — or consistent as many places could have been attacked on the same basis). Then he jumps to false accusations against Iran albeit supporting a written agreement rather than a war. His statement on Palestine is nearly identical to Warren’s. He fear mongers terrorism but wants war with murder only no torture no lawless imprisonment no erosion of civil liberties. He wants wars that follow the rule of law despite the unmentionable fact that under the UN Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact all of these wars are illegal.Yeah yeah yeah you may reply there are always exceptions and Sanders has improved on matters of peace and war since his last campaign ended and his possible next campaign has not yet begun. But surely I’m cherry picking. Why don’t I look to an actual peace advocate like Congresswoman Barbara Lee who votes against wars and sometimes tries to end them? Despite herbeing seven years old Lee’s position is indeed far superior to if shorter and less specific than Warren’s or Sanders’. She focuses on spending and opposes war-making in general. She opposes “preemption” even while in the end believing it theoretically possible to “exhaust all peaceful diplomatic means.”is also shorter than Warren’s or Sanders’ but clear enough so that many specific questions have been answered in general. She avoids mealy-mouthed Washingtonian-nazistic terms like “preemption” (which in fairness Lee was quoting from Bush) and denounces aggressive wars as “acts of aggression.” Without ever proclaiming herself to be yet another “outsider” in politics she writes (or approves her staff’s or volunteers’ writing) as someone who actually has yet to be corrupted by the war-making capital of the earth.“Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003” she says “the United States has entangled itself in war and occupation throughout the Middle East and North Africa. As of 2018 we are currently involved in military action in Libya Syria Iraq Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan and Somalia. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in these countries have been killed either as collateral damage from American strikes or from the instability caused by U.S. interventions. Millions more have fled their broken countries contributing to the global refugee crisis.”Already in one paragraph Ocasio-Cortez has done six previously impossible-post-Kucinich things before breakfast. She’s opposed the wars as a whole. She’s listed them. She’s included Yemen. She’s included Libya. She’s named the primary victims and the guilty party. She’s named the cause of the refugee crisis. She continues:“This continued action damages America’s legitimacy as a force for good creates new generations of potential terrorists and erodes American prosperity. In times when we’re told that there’s not enough money Republicans and corporate Democrats seem to find the cash to fund a $1.1 trillion fighter jet program or a $1.7 trillion-dollar nuclear weapon “modernization” program. The costs are extreme: the Pentagon’s budget for 2018 is $700 billion dollars: to continue fighting an endless War on Terror and refighting the Cold War with a new arms race that nobody can win.”Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is here doing what one generally has toretire in order to d: she’s pointing out that the wars create more enemies and hostility and terrorism and danger rather than more safety and security and peace. The wars are counter-productive on their own terms on top of everything else wrong with them. She also goes after the “at least they’re job-creators” sociopathic line by pointing out that in fact they damage U.S. prosperity along with U.S. moral authority. This is a candidate from a district with much poverty denouncing in the rarest of ways one of the chief causes of that poverty in a manner that we don’t tend to see in candidates from Washington D.C. suburbs but which we might start to see from some other places if we make it known that Ocasio-Cortez has this platform and wins on it. She goes on:“According to the Constitution the right to declare war belongs to the legislative body and yet many of these global acts of aggression have never once been voted on by Congress. In some cases we’ve even acted unilaterally without the backing of the United Nations.”In fact there has been no U.N. authorization for any of the wars in her list above. The U.N. authorized a rescue-from-a-fictional-threat in Libya not an overthrow. And the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not include the loopholes found in the U.N. Charter that is so often imagined must sometimes apply. But for Ocasio-Cortez to even mention the U.N. Charter is a giant leap forward. Watchwhen I tried to get Senator Tim Kaine to acknowledge the U.N. Charter’s existence. Alexandria goes on:“America should not be in the business of destabilizing countries. While we may see ourselves as liberators the world increasingly views us as occupiers and aggressors. Alexandria believes that we must end the ‘forever war’ by bringing our troops home and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world.”Several more breakthroughs here that is: statements common in the peace movement but unheard of on television or Congressional campaign platforms. She says the U.S. is in the business of destabilizing countries. She cites the world’s opinion. She proposes ending the wars (and foreign basing?). She does NOT mean replacing troops with aerial bombing because she says the bombing must end. And she points out that the bombing generates terrorism rather than snuffing it out. She concludes:“By bringing our troops home we can begin to heal the wounds we’re opening by continuing military engagement. We can begin to repair our image. We can reunite military families separated by repeated deployments. We can become stronger by building stronger diplomatic and economic ties and by saving our armed forces only for when they’re truly needed.”And she blows it in the end by proposing that war is sometimes needed. It. Yet how far she has come or failed to retreat in comparison with the Congress she hopes to join! And think of the legislative actions she must take if she believes in her platform and has the courage of her convictions. She must reintroduce and lobby for long-unseen economic conversion legislation. She must use the War Powers Act to force a vote on each illegal immoral disastrous war she has listed and any others like them she must seek to reduce military funding — perhaps creating legislation along with her one Congressional backer Ro Khanna along the lines of his recent attempted amendment that would have cut 5%. She must seek to block weapons sales abroad and to local police. She must introduce legislation that would make the U.S. military subject to environmental agreements that everyone else is subject to. She must work to replace military “service” as a means to citizenship with free college as a right of the same. She must support diplomacy even when Trump does it. But she must support impeaching Trump for the reasons she already does plus the reasons included in her “Peace Economy” platform.One Congress member cannot do any of this without a massive public movement that compels other Congress members to do so too. But part of so moving them must be showing our support for one among them who takes the lead. Right now the future Congress member in the lead is,1
Why It Matters That Peace Is Gone from Ocasio-Cortez Website | Freepress.orWhy It Matters That Peace Is Gone from Ocasio-Cortez WebsitNewly popular Democratic politician hero and nominee for a seat in the U.S. Congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used to have these words on her“Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 the United States has entangled itself in war and occupation throughout the Middle East and North Africa. As of 2018 we are currently involved in military action in Libya Syria Iraq Afghanistan Yemen Pakistan and Somalia. According to the Constitution the right to declare war belongs to the Legislative body not the President. Yet most of these acts of aggression have never once been voted on by Congress. Alex believes that we must end the forever war by bringing our troops home and ending the air strikes and bombings that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism and occupation throughout the world.”Now they’re gone. Asked about it on Twitter she replied:“Hey! Looking into this. Nothing malicious! Site is supporter-run so things happen -we’ll get to the bottom of it.”A lot of people have been publicly encouraging her to proceed with getting to the bottom of it. One person has even designedfor her to use with the above text to match the logos she’s used with other “Issues” sections of her website. Tech-pro volunteers stand ready to help with the task of re-adding the words to the website at a moment’s notice.Why does this matter? It’s just five pretty vague non-committal sentences. It gives no indication even within say $300 billion what the nominee would like where in the federal budget what steps she might take to end which wars or what wars if any she considers impeachable offenses or what initiatives she might undertake to advance peace diplomacy the rule of law or conversion to a peace economy. What’s the big deal?For one thing the bar is very low in these matters. I’m not aware of a single candidate for Congress who has so much as hinted at what the federal budget should look like or even been asked to do so. I searched Democratic Congressional campaign websites and founda grand total of eighthat mentioned any sort of opposition to war at all. (Most don’t even mention the existence of foreign policy.) Of those eight statements Ocasio-Cortez’s five sentences are (were) in some ways the strongest. She lists major current wars. She calls them acts of aggression. She says she wants to end the forever war strongly implying that she wants to end each of the wars she named and any others like them. She says she wants to end bombings not just troop deployment. And she notes that the bombings are counterproductive on their own terms.While the obviousness with which these wars are in fact acts of aggression is staggering it is not possible to hire a political consultant in the United States who would advise you to leave that on your website. Acts of aggression are indisputably illegal as well as being something that very serious people only accuse non-U.S. governments of when trying to fuel the cycle of violence that Ocasio-Cortez opposes (opposed). If you run for Congress admitting that the U.S. government is engaged in a criminal enterprise that in fact the majority of what the government does is what was characterized at Nuremberg as the supreme international crime people should have the right to expect you to do something about it.Now we’re getting to why this really matters. Some 60% of federal discretionary spending goes to militarism. Most candidates for Congress are only campaigning for 40% of a job. They’re saying literally nothing about foreign policy and nobody is asking them. So Ocasio-Cortez is (was) exceptional but exceptional in even touching fleetingly on the majority of the job for which she is applying. She’s done so in a couple of instances that I’m aware of beyond the now-deleted five sentences. She tweeted opposition to an Israeli massacre of Palestinians and she spoke in support of the same position in a video interview with Glenn Greenwald. She also tweeted in opposition to an AUMF including these words:“War doesn’t bring peace. Alleviating poverty does. Education does. Representative gov does.”That’s not a Bernie Sanders candidate. That’s a better than Bernie Sanders candidate.But why does it matter what she says on her website? I’ll tell you why. When people campaign on peace they tend to win and that fact tends to be erased either by silence or by the elected official turning toward war after the election. When someone wins a primary campaigning for peace others need to learn of it. And when they win a general election campaigning for peace others need to learn of it. This is how you get more candidates to support peace.The notion that someone will secretly plan to work for peace while going silent or pretending to favor war until they are elected has very few examples to support it and thousands going against it. Very rare is Congressman Ro Khanna whose website is silent on peace but whose career actually works for it. Far more common is one of the other seven candidates with peace on their campaign websites Pramila Jayapal an incumbent who has yet to distinguish herself through actions.While those who campaign on peace may do little for it those who do anything for it tend to have campaigned on it.A candidate who surrounds himself or herself with people who delete peace from a website is a candidate hearing bad advice and a future official likely to go on hearing bad advice.Now of course I’m hoping that Ocasio-Cortez does indeed replace her words on her website. I’m hoping that some of her passionate supporters who have baselessly claimed that she’s preparing a longer better statement on a peace economy turn out to be right. Nothing would please me more. And I would indeed immediately start promoting Ocasio-Cortez for Congress. She is after all excellent on many other issues and her positions on other issues would actually make sense and be achievable with a peace economy.I hope the new better statement is on her website by the time I publish this. I hope all of her fans have a chance to call me a fool for mentioning such a thing at all. I hope they accept me as a fellow fan despite my lack of total blind loyalty.But what’s been revealed during the time that the five sentences have been gone from the website has been quite disturbing even if typical and predictable. People haven’t just invented excuses. Some have denounced any criticism or questioning as inappropriate. Others have claimed that Ocasio-Cortez should not be held responsible for her own website at all. Others have suggested that she shouldn’t have time to deal with a website until after she’s elected (and has less important work to do than campaigning?). Others have of course used thewhich proposes that any candidate you like is secretly for peace but wise to pretend otherwise while campaigning (and perhaps even while governing).So when I say that others need to hear that a candidate campaigned on peace and won I don’t just mean other candidates I mean other people in general. The main reason bigger even than financial corruption and corporate media that more candidates don’t win while campaigning for peace is that almost never do any of them try it.,1
New Polls Show Anti-Trump Isn’t Enough to Beat GOP | Freepress.orNew Polls Show Anti-Trump Isn’t Enough to Beat GOWith six months to go before the midterm election new national polls are showing that the Democratic Party’s much-touted momentum to gain control of the House has stalled out. The latest numbers tell us a lot about the limits of denouncing Donald Trump without offering much more than a return to the old status quo.Under the headline “Democrats’ 2018 Advantage Is Nearly Gone” CNNWednesday that nationwide polling found “the generic congressional ballot has continued to tighten” -- “with the Democrats’ edge over Republicans within the poll’s margin of sampling error for the first time this cycle.”With so many gerrymandered districts as well as widespread voter-ID laws and other GOP-engineered voter suppression Democrats will need a substantial margin in vote totals to prevent Republicans from retaining a majority in the House of Representatives. (The prospects are worse in the Senate where Democrats are defending a lopsided number of seats this year.)While “47 percent of registered voters say they back the Democratic candidate in their district 44 percent back the Republican” according to CNN. “Voters also are divided almost evenly over whether the country would be better off with the Democrats in control of Congress (31 percent) or with the GOP in charge (30 percent). A sizable 34 percent -- including nearly half of independent voters (48 percent) -- say it doesn't matter which party controls Congress.”The CNN survey comes on the heels of other grim national polling.last week a Reuters poll concluded that “enthusiasm for the Democratic Party is waning among millennials.”“The online survey of more than 16000 registered voters ages 18 to 34 shows their support for Democrats over Republicans for Congress slipped by about 9 percentage points over the past two years to 46 percent overall” Reuters reported. “And they increasingly say the Republican Party is a better steward of the economy.”Young people overwhelmingly supported Bernie Sanders during his 2016 campaign for president. With their votes in Democratic Party primaries and caucuses two years ago the young showed that they want truth about the destructive effects of corporate power -- and forceful action against its manifestations whether economic injustice or climate change.Overall the latest generation of adults is negative about the demagogue in the White House. But most Democratic leaders aren’t offering a clear and compelling alternative. As Reuters put it “Although nearly two of three young voters polled said they do not like Republican President Donald Trump their distaste for him does not necessarily extend to all Republicans or translate directly into votes for Democratic congressional candidates.”Six months ago the independent reportAutopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisithat young people “increasingly want politics to be for something profoundly positive rather than just against Republicans.” As a member of the task force that worked on the report I was struck by how the top echelon of the Democratic Party keeps trying to insulate itself from -- and fend off -- the tremendous energy that mobilized behind Sanders during the primaries.In short the Democratic Party is still dominated by elected officials and power brokers who appear to bethat a future progressive upsurge of political engagement could loosen -- or even end -- their corporate-funded grip on the party. As the Autopsy report “Emerging sectors of the electorate are compelling the Democratic Party to come to terms with adamant grassroots rejection of economic injustice institutionalized racism gender inequality environmental destruction and corporate domination. Siding with the people who constitute the base isn’t truly possible when party leaders seem to be afraid of them.”The Sanders campaign was “mostly propelled by millennials” the report noted and the campaign “turned what conventional wisdom had pegged as an obscure 2-percent campaign into a photo finish with the establishment’s preferred candidate. Once the nomination was settled much of this grassroots energy dissipated as the Clinton campaign declined to adopt positions like single-payer health care and free public college that resonated with young voters.”Those kinds of positions have gained some traction in the aftermath of 2016 but they still have a steep climb in theupper reaches of Democratic Party power. For the people atop the party it’s so much easier and more comfortable to selectively denounce Trump -- while opposing genuinely progressive agendas that would really challenge income inequality or take aim at the warfare state’s bloated budget or cross up the big donors who funnel vast quantities of money into the party.With the world facing the dual threats of climate change and nuclear holocaust it’s no exaggeration when Noam Chomskythe present-day Republican Party as “the most dangerous organization in human history.” The latest national polling reflects the reality that Democrats’ feeble partisan maneuvers are ill-suited to ousting the Republicans from power. Methodical grassroots organizing will be necessary -- to bring down the GOP’s deranged leadership and to defeat the forces of corporate power and militarism that continue to hold sway at the top of the Democratic Party.,1
The Decline and Fall of the State Department | Freepress.orThe Decline and Fall of the State DepartmenWar on Peace: The End of Diplomacy and the Decline of American Influencrecounts episodes from the Obama-Trump militarization of U.S. foreign policy. While the book begins with and has been marketed with the story of Trump firing lots of key diplomats and leaving positions unfilled much of its content is from the pre-Trump Obama-era and even Bush-era erosion of diplomacy as something distinct from war and weapons sales.The distinction between employing diplomats whose opinions are allowed to matter only when they agree with the Pentagon and not employing them at all is not as sharp a distinction as people may imagine. As with the distinction between drones that fire on unknown people when some poor schmuck is ordered to push a button and drones that decide when to fire all on their own the question of whether or not you have diplomats sounds dramatic but can make little actual difference on the ground.Farrow might partially agree with my assessment but he writes as someone who believes that the United States responds to North Korean threats rather than the reverse and works nobly to “contain” Iranian pursuits of “regional hegemony” rather than strives for global hegemony at all costs.While Obama was president the State Department helped break all records for weapons sales the United States bombed several countries the U.S. and NATO destroyed Libya drone wars came into their own with catastrophic results serious action on the earth’s climate was carefully sabotaged and the U.S. military expanded into much of Africa and Asia. The crowning achievement called the Iran Nuclear Agreement was not some sort of advance in human rights peace justice or cooperation. Rather it was the unnecessary and pointless product of U.S. propaganda creating a false threat from Iran belief in which may outlast the agreement.A large chunk of Farrow’s book is a portrait of Richard Holbrooke as a power-mad schemer but frustrated advocate for non-militarized diplomacy. This is the same Richard Holbrooke I had to remind myself who publicly told Congress that the State Department’s job in Afghanistan was to support the military. This is the same guy who claimed that if the United States ended the war the Taliban would work with al Qaeda which would endanger the United States — while at the same time admitting that al Qaeda had virtually no presence in Afghanistan that the Taliban would be unlikely to work with al Qaeda and that al Qaeda could plan crimes from anywhere in the world there being nothing special about Afghan air for that purpose.Asked at a U.S. Senate hearing in 2010 the year he died what in the world he was doing and toward what end in Afghanistan Holbrooke repeatedly failed to produce an answer. That could explain his deathbed conversion and his final words to his surgeon: “You’ve got to stop this war in Afghanistan.” As if his doctor could do what he refused to play any role in or at least failed to play any role in. It’s hard to picture Holbrooke as struggling for peace when we recall that this is the very same man who in 1999to include what Serbia would never accept so that NATO could begin bombing.The least we can say is that Holbrooke was employed as a diplomat a job that can sometimes involve choosing peace instead of war. And nobody replaced him. So we now have to expect peace out of people employed to wage war.But the notion that the State Department is now engaged in or was until recently even partially engaged in pursuing peace is difficult to swallow because no account of life inside the State Department can compare with our encounter with that life itself as it was slipped to us through WikiLeaks in the form of all those cables.It’s interesting for sure to read about the frustrations of those who want to actually provide humanitarian aid but whose intended recipients need to not be publicly associated with the United States due to its unpopularity. But the need to kiss up to the war makers is something we’ve seen in public. And the State Department cables reveal an institution dripping with contempt for humanity democracy peace justice and the rule of law.The solution is not I think to shout “good riddance!” and dance on the grave of diplomacy. Though it is to get out of the way and allow the two Koreas and numerous other partners to engage in it unmolested. In the end what we need is to recognize diplomacy as something incompatible with war mongering and to choose the former over the latter.,1
Ohio gubernatorial candidates weigh in: Corporate money in politics green energy | ColumbusFreePress.coOhio gubernatorial candidates weigh in: Corporate money in politics green energFrom left: moderator Dr. Melissa Crum Joe Schiavoni Constance Gadell-Newton empty seat (Richard Cordray) Bill O’Neill and Dennis Kucinich.As the primary election for Ohio governor draws near voters want to know where candidates stand on issues that affect Ohioans the most. To get some answers Yes We Can Columbus hosted a candidates’ forum on March 12 at Strongwater Food and Spirits.Democratic and Green gubernatorial candidates answered questions that were crowdsourced from the audience — about economic segregation affordable housing funding public education police brutality abortion rights and gun control. Candidates proposed various solutions to these issues but they had no major disagreements about the causes and nature of the problems.Candidates did disagree about the influence of moneyed interests in politics. Moderator Dr. Melissa Crum asked the candidates these questions: Will you pledge to refuse contributions from corporate PACs from the fossil fuel industry and from the National Rifle Association? And what will you do fight the influence of money in our politics at all levels of government?answered “yes” to all three pledges. “I’ve spent a lifetime fighting corporate interests” he said. “I won’t take corporate money. I’m not their candidate. I will push for public financing of Ohio elections.”Kucinich gestured toward the empty seat reserved for Democratic candidate Richard Cordray. “The fact that there is a candidate missing today who couldn’t answer ‘yes’ to maybe any of those questions is a serious problem” he said. Cordray has an “A” rating from the NRA.pledged to refuse campaign dollars from the NRA. “I never have and I never will” he said. But Schiavoni admitted that as Senate Minority Leader he accepted money from corporate PACs and the fossil fuel industry. “I was going up against 23 Republicans who had millions and millions of dollars” he said. “I never did any favors or showed any favoritism to those PACs that were donating to my campaign. I promise you that it did not change the way I voted or who I fought for at the Statehouse.”“I will not accept any money from any corporation” said. “No corporate PACs no fossil fuels no money from the NRA. All of our funding comes from humans. We represent the people of Ohio. As a Green Party candidate I’m someone who lives by my principles. We don’t just say ‘Get corporate money out of politics.’ We’re living this in this campaign right now. Our campaign is powered by people power. We have the lowest cost per vote of any candidate.”pledged to refuse donations from corporate PACs and the NRA but not from the fossil fuel industry. “Fracking is a very dangerous process but if properly regulated it can protect the water” he said. “There is a long history of reducing our use of coal by using natural gas that comes from fracking and if properly done it’s OK. As to the fuel industry they’re going into alternatives right now. BP is investing in solar and wind in addition to their normal products.”O’Neill continued his defense of fossil fuels into two follow-up questions from Dr. Crum: “Do you agree that we must transition Ohio to 100% renewable energy as quickly as possible? And beyond just keeping the Strickland renewable energy standards how would you work to aggressively increase investment in renewable energy and away from fossil fuels across the state?”“Yes but we will never get there 100%” O’Neill said. “If the state were to prioritize clean energy we could make a big dent.” O’Neill’s only proposed solution was symbolic and weak: “Solar panels on top of every government building in Ohio!”Kucinich proposed “investment of state dollars in renewables and making it a part of economic development. People in southeastern Ohio are being exploited by the fracking industry” he said. “Their land is being ruined. Their children are having adverse health effects. It’s a sacrifice zone. It’s immoral. As governor I intend to put an end to fracking and deep injection wells.”Schiavoni agreed that Ohio must “move toward” renewable energy by reversing the freeze on Ohio’s clean energy standards and incentivizing wind and solar energy. He proposed “cleaning up industrial brownfields across the state and retraining our workforce to work in this industry.”“Addressing climate change has to be a top priority in Ohio” said Green candidate Gadell-Newton. “All too often when you hear politicians talk about green energy and environment they’re pitting the environment against workers and the economy. This is a false narrative. I believe that in Ohio we can have a strong economya green sustainable environment. We need to transition very quickly away from fossil fuels and ban fracking and injection wells. My plan is to promote the creation of green energy co-ops that are worker-owned and consumer-owned. We have a steel industry in Ohio that can be used to build solar and windmills. We can create a green energy industry in Ohio built by Ohioans for Ohioans!”Bob Bites Back: The Columbus Way won’t worSocialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Women’s DaBreaking down the Columbus bond issues for the May 7th primary electio,1
CDC Director Resigns but CDC Conflicts of Interest are Par for the Course | Freepress.orCDC Director Resigns but CDC Conflicts of Interest are Par for the CoursMedia outlets are announcing the abrupt resignation of Brenda Fitzgerald the physician appointed in July 2017 to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The resignation follows on the heels of reporting by which uncovered conflicts of interest pertaining to dubious investment decisions made by Fitzgerald after she became the nation’s top public health official—including the purchase of thousands of dollars of tobacco pharmaceutical and health care stocks. Individuals interviewed bydescribe the trading decisions as “sloppy” and “ridiculous” at best and “legally problematic” at worst.Most headlines are focusing exclusively on the CDC director’s investments in tobacco companies which strike observers as hypocritical in light of Fitzgerald’sprioritization of tobacco prevention initiativewhile serving as public health commissioner for the state of Georgia prior to joining CDC. However Fitzgerald’s sizeable investments in the pharmaceutical and chemical giants Merck and Bayer among others should raise just as many red flags.The CDC has its own lengthy history ofand has routinely turned a blind eye to conflicts of interest while it works to “protect the private good.”Both Merck and Bayer have a pattern of wreaking havoc on human health while striving to bury the evidence. Merck for example manufactures the top-selling but devastating Gardasil vaccine and usedand other deceptive tactics to conceal Gardasil’s risks. Whistleblowers also have accused Merck ofits mumps vaccine data. Bayer too has a track record of “” having once paid out millions to the U.S. government in aafter admitting to overcharging for Bayer’s antibiotic Cipro.

What the United States urgently needs—and taxpayers firmly deserve—is ethical leadership across the board at CDC provided by individuals who are free from financial conflicts both before and after taking office.

Bernie Sanders Hits on Winning Message He Avoided in 2016 | Freepress.orBernie Sanders Hits on Winning Message He Avoided in 201has shown up on Senator Bernie Sanders’ Facebook page with his name on it and his face in it making all the familiar (to a small number of people) points about U.S. military spending (how much it is how it compares to the rest of the world how it does not produce jobs what wonders could be achieved with a small fraction of it etc.).I wish there were mention of the fact that it kills huge numbers of people or that it risks apocalypse or that it damages the earth’s environment. I wish the alternatives proposed were not all of the bring-our-war-dollars-home variety as if the amount of money under consideration were not enough to radically transform this and every other country.Still had Sanders put out this video in 2015 tens of thousands of people wouldn’t have had tohim in vain to oppose militarism to fill the glaring gap in his. I wouldn’t have had to writeSanders willingly subjected himself to endless accusations of raising taxes rather than declare that he would push for a small cut in military spending. Jeremy Corbyn has had greater success — albeit in a different country — by taking the other approach. I continue to think Sanders is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.It’s not as if Sanders doesn’t know the issues. A half-century back he would have said something very close to what I want to hear. There’s no reason why he can’t do so now. But I’m afraid that this video may have slipped through because there’s not a presidential election this year and that such things will be nowhere to be found in the years ahead.I hope I’m wrong. I hope that Sanders actually declares himself in favor of a serious transfer of resources from militarism to human and environmental needs. As soon as he does I’ll start advocating for all of us to work for his election. He can keep promoting the Russiagate nonsense that was primarily invented to distract from the story of the DNC cheating him. He can publicly commit to allowing the DNC to cheat him again. He can ask Saudi Arabia again to kill even more people. But if he comes out against the military budget that’s the big one. He will deserve the support he could have had last time.,1
Russiagate Suddenly Becomes Bigger | Freepress.orIt’s hard to know where to begin. Last Friday’s indictment of 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies by Special Counsel Robert Mueller was detailed inthat provided a great deal of specific evidence claiming that a company based in St. Petersburg starting in 2014 was using social media to assess American attitudes. Using that assessment the companyallegedly later ran a clandestine operation seeking to influence opinion in the United States regarding the candidates in the 2016 election in which it favored Donald Trump and denigrated Hillary Clinton. The Russians identified by name are all back in Russia and cannot be extradited to the U.S. so the indictment is to a certain extent political theater as the accused’s defense will never be heard.In presenting the document Rod Rosenstein Deputy Attorney General stressed that there wasthat the alleged Russian activity actually changed the result of the 2016 presidential election or that any actual votes were altered or tampered with. Nor was there any direct link to either the Russian government or its officials or to the Donald Trump campaign developed as a result of the nine-month long investigation. There was also lacking any mention in the indictment of the Democratic National Committee Hillary Clinton and Podesta e-mails so it is to be presumed that the activity described in the document was unrelated to the WikiLeaks disclosures.Those of the “okay there’s smoke but where’s the fire” school of thought immediately noted the significant elephant in the room namely that the document did not include any suggestion that there had been collusion between Team Trump and Moscow. As that narrative has become the verydriving the Mueller investigation its omission is noteworthy. Meanwhile those who see more substance in what was revealed by the evidence provided in the indictment and who for political reasons would like to see Trump damaged will surely be encouraged by their belief that the noose is tightening around the president.Assuming the indictment is accurate I would agree that the activity of the Internet Research Agency does indeed have some of the hallmarks of a covert action intelligence operation in terms how it used some spying tradecraft to support its organization targeting and activity. But its employees also displayed considerable amateur behavior suggesting that they were not professional spies supporting the argument that it was not a government intelligence operation or an initiative under Kremlin control. And beyond that so what? Even on a worst-case basis stirring things up is what intelligence agencies do andno one is more active in interferinin foreign governments and elections than the United States of America most notably in Russia for the election of Boris Yeltsin in 1996 which was arranged by Washington and more recently in Ukraine in 2014. From my own experience I can cite Italy’s 1976 national election in which the CIA went all out to keep the communists out of government. Couriers were discreetly dispatched to the headquarters of all the Italian right wing parties dropping off bags of money for “expenses” while the Italian newspapers were full of articles written by Agency-paid hacks warning of the dangers of communism. And this all went on clandestinely even though Italy was a democracy an ally and NATO member.Does that mean that Washington should do nothing in response? No not at all. Russia if the indictment is accurate may have run an influencing operation and gotten caught with its hand in the cookie jar. Or maybe not. And Washington might also actually have information suggesting that Russia is preparing to engage in further interference in the 2018 and 2020 electionsthe heads of the intelligence agencies though as usual evidence for the claim is lacking. There has to be bilateral confidential discussion of such activity between Washington and Moscow and a warning given that such behavior will not be tolerated in the future but only based on irrefutable solid evidence. The leadership in both countries should be made to understand very clearly that there are more compelling reasons to maintain good bilateral working relations than not.With that in mind it is important not to overreact and to base any U.S. response on the actual damage that was inflicted. The indictment suggests that Russia is out to destroy American democracy by promoting “distrust” of government as well as sowing “discord” in the U.S. political system while also encouraging “divisiveness” among the American people. I would suggest in Russia’s defense that the U.S. political system is already doing a good job at self-destructing and the difficult-to-prove accusations being hurled at Moscow are the type one flings when there is not really anything important to say.I would suggest that Moscow might well want to destroy American democracy but there is no evidence in the indictment to support that hypothesis. I particularly note that the document makes a number of assumptions which appear to be purely speculative for which it provides no evidence. It describes the Russian company Internet Research Agency as “engaged in operations to interfere with elections and political processes.” Its employees were involved i“interference operations targeting the United States. From in or around 2014 to the present Defendants knowingly and intentionally conspired with each other (and with persons known and unknown to the Grand Jury) to defraud the United States by impairing obstructing and defeating the lawful functions of the government through fraud and deceit for the purpose of interfering with the U.S. political and electoral processes including the presidential election of 2016.”The theme of Russian subversion is repeated throughout the indictment without any compelling evidence to explain how Mueller knows what he asserts to be true suggesting either that the document would have benefited from a good editor or that whoever drafted it was making things up. Internet Research Agency allegedly “conduct[ed] what it called ‘information warfare against the United States of America’ through fictitious U.S. personas on social media platforms and other Internet-based media.” The indictment goes on to assert tha“By in or around May 2014 the ORGANIZATION’s strategy included interfering with the 2016 U.S. presidential election with the stated goal of ‘spread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general’”“strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system including the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Defendants posted derogatory information about a number of candidates and by early to mid-2016 Defendants’ operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign”) and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities including buying political advertisements on social media in the name of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.”“traveled in and around the United States including stops in Nevada California New Mexico Colorado Illinois Michigan Louisiana Texas and New York to gather intelligence. After the trip [they] exchanged an intelligence report regarding the trip. The conspiracy had as its object the opening of accounts under false names at U.S. financial institutions and a digital payments company in order to receive and send money into and out of the United States to support the ORGANIZATION’s operations in the United States and for. Defendants and their co-conspirators also used the accounts to receive money from real U.S. persons in exchange for posting promotions and advertisements on the ORGANIZATION-controlled social media pages. Defendants and their co-conspirators typically charged certain U.S. merchants and U.S. social media sites between 25 and 50 U.S. dollars per post for promotional content on their popular false U.S. persona accounts including Being Patriotic Defend the 2nd and Blacktivist. All in violation of Title 18 United States Code Section 1349.”Note particularly the money laundering and for-profit aspects of the Internet Research scheme something that would be eschewed if it were an actual intelligence operation. There isthat it all might have been what is referred to as a click-bait commercial marketing scheme set up to make money from advertising fees. Also note how small the entire operation was. It focused on limited social media activity while spending an estimated $1 million on the entire venture with Facebook admitting to a total of $100000 in total ad buys only half of which were before the election. It doesn’t smell like a major foreign government intelligence/influence initiative intended to “overthrow democracy.” And who attended the phony political rallies? How many votes did the whole thing cause to change? Impossible to know but given a campaign in which billions were spent and both fake and real news were flying in all directions one would have to assume that the Russian effort was largely a waste of time if it indeed was even as described or serious in the first place.And apart from the money laundering aspect of the alleged campaign was it even illegal apart from the allegations of possible visa fraud and money laundering? If the Russians involved were getting their financial support from the Moscow government then it would be necessary to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) of 1938 but if not they would be protected by the Constitution and have the same First Amendment right to express their opinions of Hillary Clinton on blogs and websites while also associating with others politically as do all other residents of the United States. Many of the commenters on this Unz site are foreign and are not required either by law or custom to state where they come from.And of course there is one other thing. There always is. One major media outletthat there could be consequences for American citizens who wittingly or unwittingly helped the Russians identified in the indictment as “persons known and unknown.” A former federal prosecutor put it another way saying “While they went to great pains to say they are not indicting any Americans today if I was an American and I did cooperate with Russians I would be extremely frightened…”“Now a legal framework exists for criminal charges against Americans…” and cites a former U.S. district attorney’s observation that “Think of a conspiracy indicting partiesknown and unknown’ as a Matroyshka doll. There are many more layers to be successively revealed over time.”Under normal circumstances an American citizen colluding with a foreign country would have to be convicted of engaging in an illegal conspiracy which would require being aware that the foreigners were involved in criminal behavior and knowingly aiding them. But today’s overheated atmosphere in Washington is anything but normal. Russia’s two major media outlets that operate in the U.S. Sputnik and RT America have been forced to register under FARA. Does that mean that the hundreds of American citizens who appeared on their programs prior to the 2016 election to talk about national politics will be next in line for punishment? Stay tuned.,1
DNC Chair Tom Perez the Democratic Party’s Grim Metaphor | Freepress.orDNC Chair Tom Perez the Democratic Party’s Grim Metaphoometimes a party’s leader seems to symbolize an enduring malaise. For Democrats in 2018 that institutional leader is Tom Perez.While serving as secretary of labor during President Obama’s second term Perez gained a reputation as an advocate for workers and civil rights. That image may have helped him win a narrow election among Democratic leaders to become chair of the Democratic National Committee with the backing of Hillary Clinton loyalists eager to prevent the top DNC job from going to Bernie Sanders supporter Rep. Keith Ellison.Perez’s leadership of the DNC during the last 11 months has been mediocre or worse. The problems go far beyond administrative failings lack of inspirational impacts or shortcomings in fundraising. His mode of using progressive rhetoric whilefrom key DNC committees reflected a pattern.At the top of the DNC the Clinton wing’s determination to keep the progressive base at arm’s length has not abated -- while at the same time the DNC proclaims its commitment to the progressive base. The contradiction exists because of Democratic Partypriorities revolving around corporate poweTo align the DNC with a grassroots base that is notably more progressive and has enormous energy to challenge Wall Street and the it would be necessary to welcome that energy instead of trying to keep it at bay.Rhetoric aside the DNC leadership is hardly oriented to challenging the corporate domination that imposes so much economic injustice. Some disturbing indicators of the current chair’s orientation can be found in his Obama-era record as an assistant attorney general as well as head of the Labor Department.“Before Tom Perez was Labor Secretary granting waivers to indicted banks he was at the Justice Department not prosecuting Steve Mnuchin for illegally foreclosing on active duty troops” financial specialist Matt Stoller pointed out in a recentA former budget staffer on Capitol Hill Stoller wrote anthat laid out in detail how Perez refused to confront the criminal actions of large banks and their top executives during his eight years at the Justice and Labor departments. Stoller noted that “the reluctance to take on Wall Street has been a hallmark of the modern Democratic Party -- and has served as an electoral headwind up and down the ticket.”And Stoller wrote Perez “represents the finance-friendly status quo that has relegated Democrats to minority status.”During the electoral tailspin of 2016 Perez was all in with Clinton’s battle against Sanders. On Feb. 5 2016 -- just after Clinton had squeaked through the Iowa caucuses -- Perez sent anto Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta looking ahead to the imminent primary in New Hampshire and caucuses in Nevada. Reporting that “I was in NH on Sunday and Nevada on Monday and Tuesday for HRC” Perez offeredon how to counter the Sanders campaign such as trying to promote a narrative that “Bernie does well only among young white liberals.”Perez closed his email memo to Podesta with a reference to the next Clinton-Sanders debate: “Let me know how I can be of further assistance. I believe I am heading to Milwaukee next Thursday to help with debate spin.”These days two years later Perez is publicly voicing strong support for the recommendations of the DNC’s Unity Reform Commission which has called for some important steps toward a more democratic Democratic Party -- including a 60 percent reduction in unelected superdelegates for the 2020 national convention. Yet we don’t know what Perez is privately saying to fellow Clinton loyalists on the Rules and Bylaws Committee that is now very slowly taking up those recommendations.that this key committee would be bereft of Sanders supporters. There are signs that the committee is slow-walking the recommendations toward a watered-down morass -- which progressives shouldWhile in recent days progressive outrage has been rightly focused on theof Democratic “leadership” in the Senate during the brief government shutdown the stasis of the DNC sank further into the shadows when the Rules and Bylaws Committee adjourned a two-day meeting on Jan. 20. It appears that even the compromise reforms painstakingly hammered out by the party’s Unity Reform Commission for the better part of 2017 are in jeopardy.In short the corporate power structure of the Democratic Party institutionalized in the DNC has not given up on blocking efforts to reform the party and how it chooses a presidential nominee. One of the key battlegrounds will be over the compromise reform proposal to eliminate three-fifths of the superdelegates at the party’s national convention; these were entrenched Democrats who lined up behind Hillary Clinton by the hundreds for the 2016 nomination before a single vote was cast by the masses in a primary or caucus.Meanwhile under Perez’s uninspiring leadership the DNC’s fundraising has been second-rate. At latest report the DNC had onlyin cash on hand while the Republican National Committee hadcash on hand. Last week aquoted a “Democratic official who has worked with Perez” as saying: “Tom is just really miserable in the job which is part of why it’s not going well. He hates the fundraising and says no to so much of the fundraising even though they are obviously not in good shape financially.”You’d think that with so much at stake and such a big hole to dig out of Perez would be concentrating all his labors on being DNC chair. But last year in late summer Brown Universitythat Perez would be spending the full 2017-18 academic year as a “senior fellow” at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. “Throughout the year Perez will engage with students faculty and visitors” the university said. He “will lead a study group in which students will engage in open-ended discussions and free-flow give and take with leading figures in American politics.”The university said that Perez would be meeting with the study group at Brown “for an hour and a half seven times this [fall] semester” and he “will hold informal lunches and office hours.” A spokeswoman for Brown University confirmed to me this week that Perez is continuing this role through the spring.That the Democratic National Committee tolerates its chair frequently shuttling to Rhode Island to teach a college course while the Democratic Party is supposed to be going all-out to defeat Republicans this year tells us a lot about the quality of the current DNC leadership.,1
Why Senator Cardin Is a Fitting Opponent for Chelsea Manning | Freepress.orWhy Senator Cardin Is a Fitting Opponent for Chelsea ManninThe top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ben Cardin has become a big star in national media by routinely denouncing Russia as a dire threat to American democracy. The senior senator from Maryland personifies the highly dangerous opportunism that has set in among leading Democrats on the subject of Russia.Chelsea Manning confirmed on Sunday that she is challenging Senator Cardin’s re-election effort in the Democratic primary this June. Her campaign has real potential to raise key issues. One of them revolves around the kind of bellicose rhetoric that heightens the dangers of conflict between the world’s two nuclear superpowers.In a typical foray into reckless hyperbole Cardina public forum in November: “When you use cyber in an affirmative way to compromise our democratic free election system that’s an attack against America. It’s an act of war. It is an act of war.”Cardin is far from the only member of Congress to use “act of war” rhetoric about alleged Russian cyber actions. Republican ultra-hawk Arizona Senatorhas hurled the phrase at Russia. But the most use of the phrase comes from a range of Democrats such as Connecticut Senatorand the normally sensible Northern California RepresentativeAs his party’s ranking member of the key Senate committee on foreign policy Cardin is at the tip of the anti-Russia propaganda spear. After three decades in Congress including nearly a dozen years in the Senate he’s an old hand at spinning. No one has worked harder to get political mileage out of “Russiagate.”Last week Cardin upped the ante with the release of athat he commissioned. In effect it’s a declaration of red-white-and-blue jihad against Russia.The report -- which accuses Russian President Vladimir Putin of “a relentless assault to undermine democracy and the rule of law in Europe and the United States” -- received massive coverage in U.S. news media.“Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president” a solo statement by Cardin declares on the opening page. With the truly repugnant President Trump in its crosshairs the report’s most polemical claims -- no matter how debatable or ahistorical -- have predictably gotten a pass from mass media.But the much-ballyhooed report is a carefully selective and distorted version of history.The expansion of NATO up to Russia’s borders the U.S.in dozens of countries’ elections (during the Clinton administration) Washington’s support for repressive regimes in the past and present -- such realities didn’t merit consideration or mention. Nor did facts such as the USA’s role asthe world’s biggest arms merchan. Or the aggressively deadly U.S. military interventions in the recent past and present from Afghanistan to Iraq to Libya.Such omissions are essential to the self-righteous tone of the Russiagate frenzy. Only with silence about basic truths of U.S. foreign policy can officials in Washington pose as leaders of an angelic nation that must confront satanic Russia.In light of what is at stake for human survival -- with the odds of nuclear war shifting ominously because of the agenda that he’s helping to push -- Senator Cardin can be understood as someone who avidly fits into patterns of nationalistic and militaristic madness. The sad fact is that he has plenty of company on Capitol Hill. Lemmings are bad enough but conformists who would drag all of humanity over the cliff with them are far worse.Democratic leadership used to be much saner. Five decades ago it was the fanatical Republican standard bearer Barry Goldwater who scorned reaching out to the Kremlin – while Democratic President Lyndon Johnsonwith Russian leaders on behalf of peaceful coexistence and reducing the risks of nuclear conflagration.Right after being sentenced to prison in August 2013 for heroic whistleblowing that exposed many U.S. war crimes Chelsea Manning released a statement that quoted Howard Zinn: “There is not a flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people.” A nuclear war between the United States and Russia would do more than kill vast numbers of innocent people. Scientific research tells us that a nuclear holocaust would make the Earth “The extreme hostility toward Russia that makes such an outcomemust be rejected. Senator Ben Cardin is one of the loudest and most prominent voices for such hostility. He should be challenged.,1
Removing Trump Will Require New Activists; The Old Ones Won’t Do It | Freepress.orRemoving Trump Will Require New Activists; The Old Ones Won’t Do IIt was convenient for the teaching moment that James Risen justrefusal back in 2004 to report on George W. Bush’s () warrantless spying prior to Bush’s “re-election” for fear of costing Bush votes at the same time that a harmoniously bipartisan Congress was just now voting to empower Donald Trump to () spy on everybody without any warrants.How did a crime become a policy? Nobody not even the “Constitutional law professor” who committed the same crime for the 8 years before Trump re-wrote the Fourth Amendment. So what transformed Bush’s crimes into Trump’s respectable policies was exactly what we said would do that: the failure to impeach Bush and remove him from office. The powers of the imperial president to spy imprison torture and murder increased under Bush and under Obama and under Trump. And if we survive Trump that trend will continue.Not only will presidential powers expand but the odiousness of the individuals occupying the office will increase. Those who say that’s impossible also said it was impossible under one or the other of the previous two presidents depending on partisanship.Thankfully a large and growing percentage of the public tells pollsters that Trump should be impeached and removed from office. Millions sign a petition or two. But they do little else. Most activist organizations do nothing at all. And most seasoned activists dismiss the very idea of ever impeaching anyone out of hand. Virtually none of them have ever heardabout the frequency and potency of impeachment through U.S. history. Every last one of them imagines that a Trump impeachment is about Russia fantasies or nothing as if thethat they themselves despise and fear Trump just don’t exist. And you’ll not find a single activist anywhere who believes their activism can change society in such a manner that following a successful impeachment the next office holder will be expected to behave better or face impeachment too.Thus when you ask a random person if Trump should be impeached and removed from office as often as not they will shout “Hell yeah!” (And I strongly suspect that pattern would hold outside of the United States as well as here within it.) But if you ask an activist at a politically engaged conference or rally in the U.S. I can almost guarantee you that — at the absolute best — they will mumble that they wouldn’t mind such an impossibility.The majority of them will then tell you the very same things they told you pre-inauguration. Nothing has changed in the anti-impeachment song list during the past year. First and foremost if you want Trump impeached you are working on behalf of the Evil Mike Pence who will be worse. Never mind that if you allow Trump to do anything he wants we may all die quickly and will certainly die slowly from climate destruction. Never mind that if you apply no limits to the presidency you will offer unprecedented power to one or the other of two candidates as bad or worse than Trump. If you think I’m kidding go ask a Democrat what Oprah should do and thenOprah in 2003 pushing for a war on Iraq. Oprah does not approach Trump in odiousness but Democrats seem completely incapable of swooning over anyone who hasn’t pushed for major mass-murders and they seem to be limiting their search to people hoarding billions of dollars while striving for vacuous corporate-friendly celebrity. This doesn’t end well.Next activists will tell you that by pursuing impeachment you’re helping the evil Democrats. Never mind that you can’t be helping both Pence and Democrats in the worldview of people who recognize and wildly exaggerate the differences between the two parties. Never mind that Nancy Pelosi has made herself the leading opponent of impeachment just as she did under George W. Bush. Never mind that Rahm Emanuel in January 2007 said they would keep Bush around and the war going for two more years in order to run “against” them again. Never mind that the Democrats’ whole permanent election campaign strategy of simply not being Trump would collapse in the absence of Trump.Next they’ll tell you that you’re failing to help the good Democrats who need you to focus on elections instead of silly distractions like establishing limits on dictatorial power. Never mind that you can’t be doing this along with your other sins. Never mind that the focus on elections has given the Democrats election losses and the rest of us a country trending toward shitholery.Next they’ll tell you that impeachment is not what poor people’s organizations want. And in the end they’ll tell you that it just can’t be done. But show me a poll of poor people who oppose impeaching Trump. I’d like to see that. The problem is not poor people or their desperate needs for food and shelter or middle-class people. The problem is the activists who have made the flabbergasting discoveries that there are lots of people including Mike Pence in the U.S. government with horrific records and that whole agencies and policies are corrupt and destructive. (I know isn’t it unbelievable? I’m shocked I tell you.)The answer if there is one is for the people whobeen properly trained in wise activism to simply get active to do more than sign a petition to organize an event to set up a lobby meeting to put stories into both good and large media and to engage in nonviolent civil resistance — not to be confused with The Resistance. None of the big organizations who jumped onto Occupy when it made the corporate news had proposed creating it in the first place. If you build an impeachment movement they will come. If you don’t I’ve warned you what’s coming.,1
"The Two Bummer Reasons why Jeff Sessions loves Pot Prohibition | Freepress.orThe Two Bummer Reasons why Jeff Sessions loves Pot ProhibitioThe announcement by US Attorney-General Jeff Sessions that he'll pursue federal pot prosecutions has two age-old motivations: power and money.Financially of course the Republican party is vested in America's vast private prison system. Every new arrestee means money in the pockets of the investors who own and operate them. Keeping those cells and beds occupied is the essence of the industry""and of Pot Prohibition.The Drug War is a giant cash cow not only for the prison owners but for the cops guards lawyers judges bailiffs and all the other operatives whose livelihood depends on destroying those of the nation's tens of millions cannabis customers.Medical legalization in about half the country and full legalization in California Colorado and other states represents a serious threat to this multi-billion-dollar incarceration scam. Sessions has risen to its defense.As long as so many millions of people smoke the stuff marijuana's illegality give police the ability to bust whoever they want whenever they want. It is the core enabler of a police state.In fact Pot Prohibition is a major foundation of the Republican Regime stretching from the White House and Congress to state government the courts and beyond.Since the Drug War's initiation by Harry J. Anslinger in the 1930s the principle focus has been on people of color. Anslinger promoted the term ""marijuana"" to deal with cannabis because it has an Hispanic twinge and aroused paranoid bigotry among the white population.While promoting films like ""Reefer Madness"" to make pot appear like some sinister force Anslinger's minions made cannabis into a racist menace.But it was Richard Nixon who took the assault to its ultimate depth. Nixon hated blacks and hippies. He also had a serious interest in slashing into their communities and depriving them of the vote.In 1972 his own Blue Ribbon Schaefer Commission recommended against Prohibition. Chaired by Pennsylvania's liberal Governor Richard Schaefer it said the health impacts did not warrant a national campaign.Nixon ignored all that. Amidst a terrible war and racial upheavals he proclaimed Drugs to be America's most serious problem.His own staff knew better. As aide John Ehrlichmann put it:""The Nixon campaign in 1968 and the Nixon White House after that had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people.""You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily we could disrupt those communities"" Ehrlichman said. ""We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes break up their meetings and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."" (The Drug War gave Nixon the key to his ""Southern Strategy."" Through a wide range of racist rhetoric and policy he successfully campaigned to move southern white racists from the Democrats to the Republicans. But many southern states had substantial black constituencies. He needed to make sure they could not vote.Slapping them in jail for pot was a powerful way to do that. Because pot is essentially everywhere it also lets police arrest pretty much any black person they want at any time. According to Michelle Alexander's THE NEW JIM CROW tens of millions of blacks and Hispanics have since been busted. And independent survey by Prof. Bob Fitrakis has estimated the number of Drug War arrests since 1970 in the range of 41000000. At a cost of more than a trillion dollars the US could instead have sent virtually everyone it busted for pot to a four-year university instead.Instead the assault has injected deep into the black and Hispanic communities a cultural toxin based in the prison culture. While busting peace environmental and social justice activists for cannabis politicians like Trump and Sessions damage the black and Hispanic communities while turning elections and driving the country to the right.Sessions occasionally make absurd moral and public health claims for keeping cannabis illegal. But the damage it has done to individual lives and the broader community is incalculable.Pot Prohibition has worked wonders for a fascist establishment keeps power only by using it as a way to crush its opposition steal elections and fatten its pockets.Anyone that says otherwise is blowing toxic smoke.",1
Social Media Madness: The Russia Canard | Freepress.orSocial Media Madness: The Russia CanarFor several months we’ve been hearing a crescendo of outcries that Russia used social media to sway the 2016 presidential election. The claim has now been debunked by an unlikely source -- one of the most Russiagate-frenzied big media outlets in the United States theFar away from the media echo chamber thenews story is headlined: “There’s Still Little Evidence That Russia’s 2016 Social Media Efforts Did Much of AnythinThe article focuses on “what we actually know about the Russian activity on Facebook and Twitter: It was often modest heavily dissociated from the campaign itself and minute in the context of election social media efforts.”In fact the ballyhooed Facebook ads were notablytargeted to be seen in swing states the piece byjournalist Philip Bump reports. As for the much-hyped tweets they were smaller than miniscule in quantity compared to overall election-related tweets.But don’t expect the fervent canard about Russian manipulation of social media to fade away anytime soon. At this point the Russiagate atmosphere has become so toxic -- with incessant propaganda credulity fear-laced conformity and partisan opportunism -- that basic logic often disintegrates.One of the weirdest aspects of claims that Russia undermined the election with social media has involved explaining away the fact that few of the ads and posts in question actually referred to Hillary Clinton Donald Trump or the election. Instead we’re told the wily Russians tried to help Trump by inflaming social divisions such as racial tensions. It’s a rampant storyline (renderedby NBC News political director Chuck Todd) that’s reminiscent of the common claim during the civil rights movement that “outside agitators” such as Russian-directed reds were inflaming and exploiting racial tensions in the South.From there it’s just a hop skip and jump to smearing Americans who dissent from U.S. orthodoxies as useful idiots who serve the interests of plotters in the Kremlin.Of course history is not exactly repeating itself but it’s rhyming an awful lot. There are real parallels between the McCarthy Era and today’s anti-Russia fervor in the United States.Despite all the information and analysis that have strengthened progressive understanding in this country during the last few decades fixating on Russia as culpable for the election of Trump has been widely irresistible. Perhaps that fixation is less upsetting than deeper realization of just how rotten the U.S. corporate system of injustice has become -- and how the forces that brought us the horrors of the Trump presidency are distinctly homegrown.on the USA. The consequences include heightened U.S.-Russia tensions that absolutely mean heightened risks of nuclear war -- and worsening threats to democratic discourse at home.The conditioned reflex to label as somehow “pro-Putin” any opinion that overlaps with a Kremlin outlook is becoming part of the muscle memory of much of the American body politic. Countless journalists pundits activists and politicians have fallen under the Russiagate spell. They include the liberal primetime lineup on MSNBC where -- as the media watchdog group FAIRlast month -- Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes routinely bypass stories of great importance in order “to lead with minutiae from the ongoing Russia investigation that has consumed MSNBC‘s coverage like no other news event since the beginning of the Trump presidency.”Across most of the media landscape the meme that Russians attacked American democracy with social-media posts has been treated as self-evident.In a typical exercise of the conformity that afflicts the national press corps the Washington bureau chief forthis fall that the House intelligence committee needed more staff to investigate in his words “how” -- not whether -- “a foreign adversary attacked American democracy.” His piece breathlessly declared that “the Trump-Russia scandal” was “expanding -- it now includes new revelations regarding Moscow’s use of social media in the United States to influence the 2016 campaign.”That kind of stenography for powerful spin may snag cable TV appearances and lucrative book contracts but it’s a notable disservice to journalism and democracy.Meanwhile most Democrats on Capitol Hill are eager to engage in such rhetoric. So it was just another routine appearance when Senator Richard Blumenthal went on CNN a week before Christmas and“there is increasing evidence that the Russians are continuing their attack on our democracy.” He said: “The Russian attack on our elections in 2016 was endlessly ingenious and inventive using all kinds of social media all kinds of intermediaries sources of information for them.”To put it mildly that sort of bombast gains vastly more airtime than discussing the urgent need for détente between the world’s two nuclear superpowers.On MSNBC Rachel Maddow has climbed with her ratings to great mass-media acclaim while advancing herselfof the Trump presidency as one of the most prominent and irresponsible Russia baiters in U.S. media. At this rate when Maddow retires -- if she and the rest of us are lucky enough to avoid a nuclear holocaust -- she can look back on a career thatinto an obsessive crusade against Russia that increased the chances of World War III.In the poisonous media environment that keeps boosting her fame and fortune it’s grotesquely fitting that Maddow ---- has devoted so much of her program to the illusory Russian assault on democracy via social media.That’s the way it goes in the propaganda-polluted land of Russiagate.,1
A look back at 2017 | ColumbusFreePress.coA look back at 201Thank Mother Earth 2017 is finally over. It was a year that chewed me up crapped me out made sweet love to me punched me in the gut stole my lunch money made me laugh pantsed me and gave me hope. And I’m only talking about American politics.It all began with saying goodbye to Barack Obama the biggest disappointment since losing your virginity. His departure was going to be the end of congressional gridlock and political baby steps. Special interests criminals and Valerie Jarrett would no longer decide the nation’s fate while the president negotiated speaking fees with Cantor Fitzgerald. The people would take back their government they would take back their lives. Yet as we know all too painfully the euphoria was immediately extinguished when Hurricane Donald made landfall.Weeks before he was even sworn in Donald Trump was completely ignoring the hominids who voted for him. He wasn’t draining the swamp he was filling it with Burmese pythons and kudzu. An oil executive as Secretary of State. A phenomenally racist Attorney General. A filthy rich 80-year-old Commerce Secretary. A moronic Energy Secretary who forgot his own department even existed. It was a group of mostly white males who clearly had no regard for the poor or working families let alone women people of color or the environment. Since the inauguration and its dark and linguistically cringeworthy speech the new Republican government has shown an ever-deepening disregard for its supporters from 2016 and attacked nearly every demographic imaginable.Perhaps the worst thing “our” government did was add Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Even without getting into Gorsuch’s specifics there are two big reasons why this is probably worse than any of the executive orders or legislation this year. The first is that it gave us many more years of Antonin Scalia and the second is how little the Constitution has ever really mattered in this country. The Supreme Court’s rulings which have a much bigger impact than legislation are never based on what the Constitution says. They rely solely on the biased political opinions of the nine incumbents. If the words of the Constitution were all that mattered the confirmation process would be a dull formality and there would be a true separation between the judiciary and the other two branches of government. Also we would have gun control religion would not possess the stranglehold on public life it currently has and the death penalty would long since have been abolished. Having Gorsuch on the bench means his antiquated views on gender could dictate the actions of millions of women and his obsolete religious ideas are likely to hold America back in a 21st century dark age. Presidents come and go legislation expires and news stories disappear when they are no longer profitable but the 50-year-old Neil Gorsuch will likely be around for a very long time; even longer than the children women won’t be allowed to abort.The Republicans followed that all-too-easy success with a spectacular failure. Their attempted dismantling of Obamacare gave many hope that their intellectual ineptitude political in-fighting and prostate problems would keep them from following through on any of their devastating proposals. The first problem was whether to just repeal or also replace Obama’s crowning achievement. They were caught between creating a known yet unspecified mess and a shambles of their own design. Already looking ahead to the midterms and 2020 they decided to be proactive and went for the nation’s jugular. Their bill stole billions of dollars from Medicaid which would have taken away healthcare from millions of Americans. It deregulated certain sections of the insurance industry thus increasing shareholder profits while dropping millions more from coverage and raising costs for everyone “fortunate” enough to be able to afford private insurance. Thankfully it was too conservative for moderate Republicans and far too liberal for the lunatics who now run the party. Adding all that to the Democrats’ determination to preserve Barry’s legacy and portray themselves as the Rebel Alliance the bill was never going to pass. The Republicans canceled the vote and a still less-than-acceptable fraction of the American people kept their existing coverage.The embarrassment from aborting a vote on their own bill was clearly too much for the Republicans. They had to get their swagger back. They had to get back to “winning … winning like never before.” So they made the calm reasonable decision to move towards a nuclear war with North Korea. It was a wag the dog moment similar to Bill Clinton bombing Muslims to distract the country from the fact a woman other than his wife was playing his saxophone. The administration started by bemoaning the lack of effectiveness of international sanctions. That was a legitimate move because North Korea has long been in self-imposed isolation and the economic superpower of China will always be an ally. However Trump then created a huge breach of etiquette by skipping bilateral negotiations and going right to threats of military action. The ways in which that was foolish are almost innumerable. Nothing causes a country to ramp up its weapons production like threatening to bomb or invade it. There is no guarantee that missile strikes would either destroy North Korea’s nuclear capabilities or cause enough civilian damage to force it to surrender. Military action would force at least China South Korea and Japan to get involved and disrupt some of the world’s largest populations and economies. Now remember all of that was because a dirt-poor socialist nation tested a few impotent rockets. America was never and still is not in any real threat of a nuclear attack. Even if it were it has systems in place to ensure a launched missile never reaches American soil. The people of this country need to realize that threats to their safety do not come from foreign sources; they come from their own elected leaders. Not much has been said about the whole ordeal in recent weeks so hopefully Trump and Kim Jong-un have found better things to focus on and learned to be happy with their girths and lengths.One area in which the Republican government did something concrete was tax reform. They wrote a sweeping bill in the shadows and kept it locked there until they were ready to vote on it. The secrecy was because they knew the Democrats would never vote for it and there would have been a huge backlash from liberal and progressive voters. We now have a good idea of what to expect once the bill goes into effect. Generally the richest Americans will get to keep more of other people’s hard-earned money and the rest will see life become even more financially burdensome. Specifically the corporate tax rate has been cut nearly in half which means larger shareholder dividends and another increase in the rapidly growing wealth gap. It also means billions less in tax revenues which will justify the government’s attacks on Medicaid and public education. The state and local tax deduction is gone so those living in states with an income and/or sales tax will pay more but see no benefit from additional government spending. The increased child tax credit doesn’t extend to the lowest-earning families. Those Americans will not receive an extra penny to help with feeding clothing or educating their children. The individual mandate included in Obamacare has been repealed but is a double-edged sword. It eliminates the fine for not having private insurance which was a despicable act by our leaders to help increase their donors’ profits or raise money from those who can ill afford to lose more. The problem with the repeal is that many Americans will drop their coverage and raise the cost of insurance for those who cannot live without it. The bill is so extremely petty that even a deduction for bicycle commuters (in an attempt to combat climate change) has been removed. It cannot be worth much in dollars to the government so it was nothing more than a middle finger to those who understand man-made climate change and do not believe an old man in the clouds is deliberately poisoning and suffocating us. The entire bill is what the year was always building towards: robber barons getting even richer at the expense of the most vulnerable sections of society. Poor people getting poorer public education becoming less accessible the environment turning more toxic and healthcare being a privilege.One thing you may have noticed about this brief summary of 2017 is that the Democrats barely showed up. That’s because they barely showed up in 2017. They offered scant resistance to the far-right forces taking over the country and they made no moves towards progressivism and away from the neoliberal nonsense that lost them the 2016 election. They let Trump have his cabinet of Voldemort’s disciples and failed to scream down his potentially dangerous rhetoric over North Korea. They haven’t created any young open-minded leaders nor have they offered any fresh ideas for the future. The Democrats spent the year whining about Trump and Russia all of which has been wasted time. The Cold War ended nearly thirty years ago so making Russia the enemy of the state again is nothing short of silly. Even if Russia did sway the election there is very little that can be done about it. A few Trump campaign staffers may go to jail but there are no special elections for the presidency so if Trump is ultimately removed from office Mike Pence becomes president. If Pence also had contact with the Russians there are many more Republican troglodytes in line for Trump’s gilded throne. Getting rid of Trump will not end the bigoted anti-science avaricious misogynistic poison we’ve had to witness this year. Also unless America gets rid of its electronic voting machines and greatly curtails campaign contributions every election will be susceptible to outside influence and theft.Despite of all my bleak comments thus far there were some positives in 2017. Firstly watching wife-of-a-former-president Hillary Clinton be a front row spectator at Trump’s inauguration brought a Paul Ryan-worthy smirk to my face. Obama’s post-presidency travels and income have provided irrefutable evidence that he was and still is yet another money-obsessed tone deaf neoliberal elitist. Progressives can now say “I told you so” and use their (hopefully mild and considerate) smugness to pull more people out to the true left. Bob Corker Joe Barton Pat Tiberi and Blake Farenthold among others will not be around in 2018 (although unfortunately still stealing oxygen). On a more serious note there really is plenty to be hopeful about moving forward. The women’s march in January attracted approximately half a million people in Washington alone and has since been ranked as the largest single-day protest in history. The fight against neofascism and neoliberalism will never succeed without women being at the forefront. Thankfully that is exactly what is happening. The increase in women participating in public life is fueling an all-around increase in political awareness and activism. More and more Americans are educating themselves on their government and public policy which will lead to better-informed voting cutting-edge grassroots activism and a more diverse pool of candidates from which to choose. The progressive left has grown exponentially in both membership and ideas. 2018 could very well see one or more socialist organizations become electoral forces. The community bill of rights movement as well as the increase in community radio stations and local nonprofits could ignore electoral politics and achieve much of what the government refuses to. There is absolutely no reason to be hopeful about our government as it currently stands but there is still plenty to be excited about. There could very well be enough energized progressives across the country to give us the America we all want and deserve.May you all have a happy healthy successful and goddamn radical 2018!Can the Green New Deal save the planet?The Cleveland School of Cannabis opens Columbus locatioThe real reason why Charter School apologists bully Columbus City School,1
U.S. corporations cash in on tax bill throw employees a bone | ColumbusFreePress.coU.S. corporations cash in on tax bill throw employees a bonDemonstrators march to Senator Rob Portman's office on December 9 to protest the GOP tax bill.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has inspired a wave of corporate largesse. When Congress passed the tax bill on December 20 AT&amp;T announced that it would give $1000 bonuses over the holidays to 200000 of its U.S. employees. Thelargest telecommunications company in the worlby revenue AT&amp;T was a vocal supporter of the tax bill which lowers the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.Other companies were quick to jump on the PR bandwagon. Comcast gave $1000 bonuses to over 100000 employees. Fifth Third announced a $15 minimum hourly wage across the company and gave out $1000 bonuses to more than 13500 of its employees.The timing of the bonuses was more than just PR spin to soften public reaction to the widely unpopular tax bill which gives a permanent tax cut to corporations and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the poor and middle class. The companies alsoby giving out the bonuses in the 2017 tax year. For example AT&amp;T gets $28 million more in tax deductions for paying out the bonuses before the 2018 tax rate kicks in.In Reaganomics terms the bonuses and raises are the tiniest “trickle” compared to the vast influx of corporate cash generated by the tax cut. Rank-and-file employees create most of the wealth so corporations are throwing them a bone to keep them loyal. For many workers the effect of this buy-off will last only until they are laid off in the next corporate downsizing.In repealing the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate the tax bill willfrom access to health care further widening the wealth gap.Conservative economists say that lower taxes will drive more corporate spending on wages R&amp;D and capital investment. But U.S. corporations have not committed to this in writing. “Even as corporate earnings have ascended to their largest share of GDP since the postwar boom and corporations get better and better at dodging the taxman wages and salaries now occupy their lowest share of GDP since the second world war” writes Henry Grabar in. “Real wages have barely budged upward since 1980—and have fallen for the lowest-paid workers.”columnist Peggy Noonan is troubled by the widening economic inequality driven by corporate greed and the increasing openness to socialism especially among young people. But shethat U.S. corporations will do the right thing with the tax bill. “This bill gives American big business more than a boatload of money it offers a historic opportunity—a timely and perhaps final one” she writes.“Big corporations can take the gift of the tax cut…and do superficial pleasing public relations sort of things while really focusing on buying back stock and upping shareholder profits. And they’ll do this if they’re stupid and craven. Or they could set themselves to saving the system that made them and helping the country that made their lives possible.“This may be the last opportunity for business leaders to do what hasn’t been done in a generation and that is defend the reputation of capitalism” Noonan writes.Mark my words: Corporate America is not going to take Noonan’s advice. And it’s not because they are stupid or craven. It’s because they’re addicted to the unlimited economic growth that capitalism promises but cannot deliver. They’ve put their faith in a unsustainable system that is sounding its own death knell. You’ve heard about peak oil? We are now in the era of peak capitalism.Bob Bites Back: The Columbus Way won’t worSocialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Women’s DaBreaking down the Columbus bond issues for the May 7th primary electioProtesters denounce GOP tax bill demand education health care for alAT&amp;T workers community supporters hit the picket line,1
Nikki Haley: The De Facto Agent of Influence | Freepress.orNikki Haley: The De Facto Agent of InfluenceThe most recent claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin is “running” Donald Trump as if the U.S. president is a Russian intelligence assetformer Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper. “[Putin] knows how to handle an asset and that’s what he’s doing with the president” Clapper told CNN last Monday.Clapper who served as DNI under President Barack Obama and who has repeatedly disparaged Trump both before and since the 2016 election called the Russian president a “great case officer” which might be the only nice thing said about Putin by a former senior U.S. official in quite some time.Clapper was asked by CNN’s Jim Sciutto “You’re saying that Russia is handling President Trump as an asset?” He responded “That seems to be... that’s the appearance to me.” Later in the conversation Clapper backtracked slightly clarifying his remarks by adding “I’m saying this figuratively.”It was not the first time that a former senior intelligence official rendered a judgment that Trump is an intelligence asset being exploited by the Russians. Back during the campaign former Acting Director of the CIA Michael Morell wroteentitled “I Ran the CIA: Now I’m Endorsing Hillary Clinton.”Morell reasoned that Putin a wily ex-career intelligence officer is “trained to identify vulnerabilities in an individual and to exploit them… In the intelligence business we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.” Morell went on to explain that he based his critique on his assessment that “Mr. Trump has…taken policy positions consistent with Russian not American interests…”Having actually been a Case Officer unlike “experts” in tradecraft Clapper and Morell I am not sure what figuratively or unwitting really mean. But I will accept the Morell definition that acting for a foreign power fits the definition of an “agent of influence.” Based on that I do think that there are some individuals in the Trump administration who are more-or-less being directed by a foreign government and its intelligence service and that government would be Israel.I would like to know more for example about the ties that the President’s son-in-law and family have to Israel and to its leadership. The Kushners are reported to be extremely close to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and if media reports are correct they have engaged in the financial support of Israeli settlements on the West Bank which the United States as well as the rest of the world consider to be illegal. And then there is America’s ambassador to Israel David Friedman who is known to be a supporter of the settlers and Jason Greenblatt the designated regional “negotiator.” What exactly is their relationship to Israel? Do any of them have dual nationality? Shouldn’t U.S. taxpayers who pony up their salaries and expenses while also having to suffer the damage they are doing to America’s reputation through their identification with an apartheid regime know who they are really loyal to? Maybe a little transparency is in order.Per Morell’s model Kushner Friedman and Greenblatt might all be considered agents of influence since their brief as U.S. officials seems to include making sure that Israel is both happy and in the loop on everything they do. How often do they meet privately with Israeli officials? Are intelligence officers involved in their meetings? What do they not report back to Washington?Nevertheless my candidate for most likely to be aIsraeli agent of influence isAmerica’s United Nations Ambassador Nikki Hale. Haley has from the start made it clear that she is all about Israel and she has done nothing since to change that impression most dramatically so over the past week when she was “taking names” and threatened retaliation against any country that was so “disrespectful” as to dare to vote against Washington’s disastrous recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital which she also helped to bring about.As governor of South Carolina Haley first became identified as an unquestioning. Immediately upon taking office at the United Nations she complained that “nowhere has the U.N.’s failure been more consistent and more outrageous than in its bias against our close ally Israel” and vowed that the “days of Israel bashing are over.” On a recent visit to Israel she was applaudedby Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In February Haley blocked the appointment of former Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad to a diplomatic position at the United Nations because he is a Palestinian. In athis past week she was asked about the decision: “Is it this administration’s position that support for Israel and support for the appointment of a well-qualified individual of Palestinian nationality to an appointment at the U.N. are mutually exclusive?” Haley responded yes that the administration is “supporting Israel” by blocking every Palestinian.Haley is inevitably a hardliner on Syria and Iran reflecting the Israeli bias. She has said thatis a Trump administration priority. A recent foray involved the White Houseit had “identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime.”in a tweet “…further attacks will be blamed on Assad but also on Russia and Iran who support him killing his own people.” At one point“We need to see Russia choose to side with the civilized world over an Assad government that brutally terrorizes its own people.”I would point out that none of these positions taken by Haley is an actual American interest but they all involve Israeli preferences. As in the cases of Kushner Friedman and Greenblatt I would like to know how frequently she meets alone with Israeli officials and most particularly intelligence officers. Is she taking direction from the Israeli government? Is she an Israeli agent of influence or just a gullible fool? The American public which pays her and has to bear the consequences of her actions need to know.,1
Oh For Godsake Leave Jill Stein Alone | Freepress.orOh For Godsake Leave Jill Stein AlonI’ve known Jill Stein for years. I knew weeks ago that the Senate “Intelligence” Committee was coming after her. I set upto put reasonable limits on Russiagate. But I’ve not heard from Jill nor had any secret communication from my good friend Vladimir nor any such nonsense. I criticize the Russian and U.S. governments as they deserve it. Nearly three years ago Russia tried to secretly hire me to spread its propaganda and I said no. Although this happened right on Capitol Hill no Congressional Committee gave a rat’s rear about it. It wasn’t part of their agenda. When I go on Russian media I say the same thing as on U.S. media though sometimes with a particular focus on criticizing Russia — a nation I’ve never been paid a dime by or worked for as a volunteer.Why is the U.S. Congress going after Jill Stein? Because no law-enforcement agency could do so since no probable cause exists to believe she has committed any crime. Neither is there probable cause to believe she engaged in the non-criminal action of shaping her policy platform based on anything she learned from anyone Russian. She went to a Russian media event something I’ve always refused to do because of people’s fear of just this sort of witch hunt. But she paid her own way. She didn’t take a dime from the Russian government. She didn’t even demand that the Russian government help block a UN resolution on illegal Israeli settlements as President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign did in order to undermine the position of the U.S. President — something the U.S. Congress seems unconcerned by. Nor did she cut any sort of deal with the Russian government whatsoever. She just attended a public event with a bunch of people who didn’t even speak the same language as each other.Jill Stein ran the same sort of campaign with the same sort of platform that she had run in previous years and that other Green Party candidates had run in years prior. She didn’t oppose bombing various countries or subsidizing fossil fuels or leaving people without health coverage because someone in Russia asked her to. She’d had the same positions for years. She didn’t oppose lesser evilism and believe the wisest electoral path to consist of running a better platform and voting your conscience because Putin gave her the idea. She’s thought that way for years.The reason Jill Stein matters to Russiagate is that it has gone on for a year without finding any solid way to blame Hillary Clinton’s campaign on Donald Trump. The original goal had been to distract the media from the Democrats’ rigging of their primary and to claim that Russia had stolen and leaked documents to WikiLeaks. Those documents should have been public as they revealed major abuses of the U.S. electoral system. But there’s no evidence they decided the election and — even after a year of digging — no evidence that Russia leaked them. And at this point there’s not much chance such evidence will ever be found. So what’s needed is a change of subject a new way in which Russia — not Hillary! — is to blame for a U.S. electoral system corrupt in dozens of ways from the start and contentedly staying that way.Lesser-evilists who blame “spoilers” would be all too happy to add “Russian collusion” to the rap sheet for Jill Stein if only to finally justify having taught their kids the word “collusion.” But the idea is patently absurd and zero evidence exists. However Congress can harass anyone it chooses. Probably cause is not required.The reason Jill Stein should matter and what we should be telling the millions of people who will now hear of her for the first time is that she entered the U.S. presidential race with a decent and humane policy platform by no means perfect but light years ahead of those of the two least popular duopolistic political parties since the invention of polling. In a system with open debates and ballot access and a ban on bribery fair funding and air time automatic registration verifiable counting election-day holiday ranked-choice voting etc. etc. a candidate with a decent platform could run and win. Jill Stein ran in part I think so that people would simply hear about such a platform. Hers was a platform dramatically superior to that even of Senator Bernie Sanders.If you think free college is popular you should see what young people think of free college and erasing all existing student debt.If single-payer healthcare with raised taxes (but net savings if you make it to that fine print) excites voters how do you think they’d respond to single-payer healthcare with no raised taxes?If fewer wars and asking Saudi Arabia to do more of the funding and fighting sounds promising what would you say to no more wars a 50 percent cut in the $1 trillion/year military spending no more weapons sales to Saudi Arabia which is doing more than enough killing thank you no more free weapons for Israel either and investment of some of the savings in a massive green energy jobs campaign producing a sustainable energy policy and a full-employment economy?Senator Bernie Sanders’ domestic proposals got millions excited but the (unfair and misleading) criticism that he would raise taxes may have been a tragic flaw and it’s one he opened himself up to by refusing to say that he’d cut the military. Stein proposed to cut at least half of the single biggest item in the discretionary budget an item that takes up at least half of that budget: military spending. She’d have cut fossil fuel subsidies as well and expected savings to come from healthcare including as a result of cutting pollution and improving food quality. But the big immediate item was the military. Cutting it is popular with voters but not with Democratic or Republican presidential candidates. Sanders was labeled the Tax Man by the corporate media while Jill Stein would have had to be attacked in a different way if she ever got mentioned.“Cutting the military budget is something that we can do right now” Stein told me back during the campaign “but we want to be clear that we are putting an end to wars for oil – period. And that is part of our core policy of a Green New Deal which creates an emergency program establishing twenty million living wage jobs full-time jobs to green the economy our energy food and transportation systems building critical infrastructure restoring ecosystems etc. This is an emergency program that will get to 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. So this is a war-time-level mobilization in order to completely detoxify our energy system and that means both nuclear and fossil fuel. In doing that we deprive the empire of this major justification for wars and bases all around the world. So we want to be clear that that emphasis is gone and goading the American public into war so as to feed our fossil fuel energy system – that ends and makes all the more essential and possible the major cutting of the military budget.”Which 50 percent of the military would Stein cut? Two places she named that she would start with (there would have to be much more) are foreign bases (she’d close them) and the U.S. nuclear weapons program.Would she unilaterally scrap U.S. nukes? I asked.“We don’t even need to do it unilaterally” Stein said “because the Russians have been begging to revive the process of nuclear disarmament which the U.S. in its wisdom undercut. … The Russians have been persistently trying to restore those nuclear talks for the purpose of disarmament. And that would be step one – is to make major reductions between the U.S. and Russia and then to convene a world forum to put an end to nuclear weapons altogether.”Those Russian positions were public not secret.The “war on terror” Stein pointed out has only created more terror while costing each U.S. household $75000. “That’s not going to make people terribly enthusiastic for it particularly when you point out that all this has done is create failed states worse terrorist threat whether you look at the Taliban the globalization of al-Qaeda the creation of ISIS. This has been an utter unmitigated disaster and the massive refugee crisis which is threatening to tear apart the European Union. This is absolutely unsustainable by any count.”To change U.S. foreign policy Stein proposed financial reforms unheard of in any presidential debate. She suggested that military and other government contractors should face “pay to play protections” preventing them from “buying their way into policy.” Stein explained: “If you establish that anyone who contributes who provides campaign contributions or who lobbies is not eligible for contracting with the government the minute you break that umbilical cord then the industry loses its power to corral Congress and dictate foreign policy.” Stein said such protections could also block U.S. government facilitation of weapons sales to foreign buyers.That position is sure to endear Stein to Senatorial Inquisitors.“War profiteering should not be allowed” Stein explained “in the same way that energy profiteering is not compatible with our survival.” Ultimately the big profits Stein said are in healthcare: “We spend a trillion dollars plus on the military industrial complex every year but we spend three trillion and counting every year on the sick care system which doesn’t make us well. It just enables us to tread water while we cope with these disastrous health impacts of the war economy and the fossil fuel economy.”Stein did not hesitate to highlight differences when I asked her about Bernie Sanders. She cited his “support for example for the F-35 weapons system which has been an incredible boondoggle.” While Sanders would keep killing with drones and “fighting terrorism” Stein called “fighting terrorism” an oxymoron and pointed to counterproductive results: “Terrorism is a response to drones that sneak up on you in the night and to night raids and this is where we recruit and we enable ISIS and al-Qaeda to continue expanding … something Bernie hasn’t quite gotten straight by saying the solution here is to turn the Saudis loose; the Saudi’s need to ‘get their hands dirty’.”“We can actually begin to rein in the Saudis with a weapons embargo and by impounding their bank accounts” Stein said outlining a policy that could have saved countless lives now lost in Yemen.The same goes for Israel she added stressing the need to respect the law. Should the United States join the International Criminal Court I asked. “Oh my god of course!” was Stein’s reply. “And the treaty on land mines?” “Of course! My god. Yes. … There are all sorts of treaties that are ready to move forward. In fact the Soviets and the Chinese have been prime movers in expansion of treaties to prohibit weapons in space and to establish the rule of law in cyberspace.”So what would President Jill Stein do about ISIS? She answered that question with no hesitation: “Number 1: we don’t stop ISIS by doing more of what created ISIS. This is like the elephant in the room that none of the other presidential candidates are willing to acknowledge even Rand Paul I might say surprisingly. So we don’t bomb ISIS and try to shoot ISIS out. We’ve got to stop ISIS in its tracks by ending the funding of ISIS and by ending the arming of ISIS. How do we do that? We do that with a weapons embargo. And so the U.S. can unilaterally move forward on that but we need to sit down and talk with the Russians as well and Putin tried to do this.“You know Putin our arch enemy Putin was actually trying to create a peace process in Syria. … We need to begin talking with Russia and with other countries.”What Stein was proposing here I should note stands in stark contrast to Russia’s actual approach of bombing Syria.“We need to build on our relative détente with Iran to engage them and we need to bring our allies into the process. Right now the peace process as I understand it is held up by guess who — Saudi Arabia who wants to bring in known terrorist groups as the representatives of the opposition. The Saudis should not be defining the way forward here … Our ally Turkey needs to understand that their membership in NATO or their position with the U.S. and other allies around the world should not be taken for granted and that they cannot be in the business either of funding ISIS and related groups through the purchase of their oil [or of] shipping weapons. They also need to close down their border to the movement of the militias.”Stein was sounding an awful lot like the leader of the Labour Party in Britain Jeremy Corbyn and I asked her about him. “I have already met with Jeremy Corbyn” she said (Egad! Will there be hearings?!) “when I was in Paris for the climate talks … and we had a surprising amount of time to talk and we agreed completely on collaborating on this ‘peace offensive’ which is the name we have given to our solution to the problem of ISIS. Peace is not passive. We need an active interventionist program based on peace which means to stop the flow or arms and money etc. So we’ve already agreed that we see eye-to-eye on foreign policy.”But Corbyn is in office with a shot at becoming prime minister. With the U.S. public completely sold on the hopelessness of third-party bids at least by non-multi-billionaires what was Stein’s plan for actually becoming president?“First of all” she said “there are 43 million young people and not-so-young people who are trapped in debt in student debt. My campaign is the only campaign that will be on the ballot that will abolish student debt. We did it for the bankers who plunged us into this economic crisis that persists in spite of what they say. And they did that by way of their waste fraud and abuse. Yet we bailed them out to the tune of $16 trillion and counting.“So isn’t it about time we bail out the victims of that waste fraud and abuse — the young people of this country whose leadership and whose civic engagement is essential for blazing the trail to our future? It has always required a fresh generation to re-envision you know what our future looks like. So we need to bail out the young people for their benefit and for ours. That can be done through another quantitative easing which is relatively simple does not cost us essentially expands the money supply in a way that works as a stimulus to the economy unlike the bailout that they provided to Wall Street which has only created a stimulus for more reckless gambling – waste fraud and abuse. … I have yet to find a young person in debt who doesn’t become a missionary for our campaign the minute they learn that we will cancel their debt. … The 43 million young people – that is a plurality of the vote. In a three-way race that’s enough to win the vote.”Stein also pointed to 25 million Latinos who she said “have learned that the Democrats are the party of deportation of night raids and of detention of refugees who are fleeing a crisis in their home countries that we created. How? Through NAFTA though illegal coups and CIA-sponsored regime changes and through the drug wars. … If people want to fix the immigration problem the answer is ‘Stop causing it.’”But would Stein be in the debates for the general election? “In my experience” she told me “all you have to do is have a real conversation have an open mic a true presidential debate that actually allows presidential candidates to debate who have broad enough support that they are on the ballot for a majority of Americans and could numerically win the election. We are challenging the Commission on Presidential Debates in court and we will be challenging them soon with a direct action campaign so stay tuned because the American public deserves to know about the issues. The American public deserves the right to vote. And they have a right to know who they can vote for and what they are voting about.”,1
Fighting the Assaults on Net Neutrality and Our Economy | Freepress.orFighting the Assaults on Net Neutrality and Our EconomyLet’s all take a moment to savor this great grass-roots U.S. Senate victory in Alabama of Democrat Doug Jones over alleged child molester Roy Moore. Let’s also celebrate the victory of the moderate Ralph Northam over the extremist Republican Ed Gillespie to be governor of Virginia and a possible flip of the Virginia Legislature with the influx of a strong contingent of progressive women.Breathe deep. Stretch up your arms. Shout for joy.Now let’s use all that great new energy to fend off Donald Trump’s twin assaults on net neutrality and our core economy.Losing could leave us blind and impoverished. So don’t even think about it.On Trump’s tax scam we have at best a few days.A mass movement already is in place to save the internet.Thursday’s vile 3-2 FCC vote tohas long been expected. Mass demonstrations community organizing court challenges an attempt at a congressional reversal and much more are in motion.Magical Thinking Is Stopping Us From Taking to the StreetThis is new territory a fight for control of. The alternative to winning is brain death.As for the GOP tax scam the clock is ticking.The Senate version passed 51-49 on Dec. 1. The House-Senate reconciliation committee wants a new version rubber-stamped next week. Despite the bill’s immense impact there’s been a complete lack of public hearings orIt’s not likely there’ll be enough Republican votes in the House to stop it.In the Senate we need just three.The likeliest is Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker the only Republican to vote “no” last time. Trump has punked him with a stream of personal insults. Corker is not running for re-election. Like all other potential swing votes he is no doubt being promised the world to vote “yes.”. She voted against gutting Obamacare. Her first “yes” vote on the tax bill reportedly was based on promises from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that Medicare and Social Security would be protected. But co-perpetrator and House Speaker Paul Ryan’s life mission has been to destroy both. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio among others proudly proclaims that this will start the process.Why anyone would believe anything the GOP leadership says is hard to fathom. Maine’s struggling elder community among others has displayed great anger including heated demonstrations at Collins’ office and her public appearances. She must know that if she votes “yes” again she will drown forever in an unforgiving grass-roots tsunami.Arizona’s Jeff Flake has been yet another target of Trump’s venal abuse. Flake dramatically announced he won’t run for re-election. But then he votedArizona’s John McCain did the same. The “Great Maverick” cast the decisive vote to save Obamacare. He’s been undergoing what must be a hugely expensive course of treatment for brain cancer.This may be among the last votes McCain casts and it’s likely a death sentence for millions of Americans who can’t afford the kind of health care he’s been getting. Does he care?Ron Johnson of Wisconsin hinted at opposing the first draft based on its rough treatment of small business. But apparently his good friend Paul Ryan found Johnson’s price.Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski voted against destroying Obamacare. But she’s ecstatic about this bill’s death sentence for the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge where her biggest donors want to drill for oil and further heat the planet.Maybe other Republicans can be turned. Trump’s minions surely have scoured every GOP wish list. And they have no intention of waiting for Doug Jones to take his seat.But somewhere somehow amid the warm glow of the Alabama turn we must find a way to stop this bill.Here are just a few reasons why:● It enacts one of history’s most blatant thefts of essential resources from working- and middle-class Americans to the rich and super-rich. Trump himself would profit.● It worsens the kind of wealth gap that fed the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed.● It guts Obamacare leaving tens of millions without medical coverage while facing needless disease—and possibly death—for themselves and their children.● It opens the all-out GOP assault on Medicaid Medicare and Social Security with the impoverishment of millions sure to follow.● It attacks public education with massive supports for private schools that will profit Trump cronies like Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.● It ends teachers’ ability to deduct what they spend on supplies for their students.● It taxes graduate students’ scholarships tuition waivers and other essential steps to advanced degrees slashing what’s left of our professional education system.● It lets tax-free churches engage in partisan campaigns allowing mega-rich donors to launder “purchases” of “pious” candidates.● It slashes support for wind power solar energy electric cars and other “Solartopian” advances while funding massive new tax breaks for obsolete planet-destroying King CONG (coal oil nukes and gas).Trump’s “tax reform” and internet assault are at the cutting edge of a suicidal war being waged by the psychotic rich against the rest of us—and the planet.We are in Koyaanisqatsi: life out of balance. The center is not holding. Our social and ecological fabric is giving way. Our survival is at stake.These turning-point elections in Virginia and Alabama give us hope.Now the gritty substance of the war for our ability to communicate and for the core of our life support systems is in a different kind of play.Like those elections these are conflicts we cannot afford to lose.,1
Battle for Democratic Party: After the Unity Reform Commission | Freepress.orBattle for Democratic Party: After the Unity Reform CommissioWith the Democratic Party’s “Unity Reform Commission” now history major political forces are entering a new stage of contention over the future of the party. Seven months after the commission’s first meeting -- and nine months after Hillary Clinton backer Tom Perez won a close election over Bernie Sanders supporter Keith Ellison to become chair of the Democratic National Committee -- the battle lines are coming into focus for next year.The commission’s final meeting adjourned on Saturday after a few steps toward democratizing the party had won approval -- due to the grassroots strength of progressives. But the recommendations from the commission will go to the Rules and Bylaws Committee which was one of the DNC decision-making bodies that Perez subjected to a purge two months ago. Now in the words of Jim Zogby (who was removed from the Executive Committee by Perez) “There are virtually no Bernie supporters on the Rules and Bylaws Committee.”When the latest Unity Reform Commission meeting got underway Perez talked a lot about unity. But kicking Sanders supporters off of key DNC committees is the ugly underside of an ongoing dual discourse. (Are we supposed to believe Perez’s soothing words or our own eyes?) And party unity behind a failed approach -- internally undemocratic and politically hitched to corporate wagons -- would hardly be auspicious.“Emerging sectors of the electorate are compelling the Democratic Party to come to terms with adamant grassroots rejection of economic injustice institutionalized racism gender inequality environmental destruction and corporate domination” says the recent report “Autopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisi” (which I co-authored). The report adds: “Siding with the people who constitute the base isn’t truly possible when party leaders seem to be afraid of them.”DNC Chairman Perez and allied power brokers keep showing that they’re afraid of the party’s progressive base. No amount of appealing rhetoric changes that reality.“We pride ourselves on being inclusive and welcoming to all” the Democratic National Committee proclaimed anew at the start of this month touting the commission meeting as “open to the public.” Yet the DNC delayed and obscured information about the meeting never replying to those who filled out an online RSVP form -- thus leaving them in the dark about the times of the meeting. In short the DNC went out of its way to suppress public turnout rather than facilitate it.One member of the task force that wrote the Autopsy Karen Bernal is the chair of the Progressive Caucus of the California Democratic Party. After traveling across the country and sitting in the sparse audience during the first day of the Unity Reform Commission meeting she took the liberty of speaking up as the second day got underway. Bernal provided a firm rebuke of the DNC’s efforts to suppress public attendance.“For all of the talk about wanting to improve and reform and make this party more transparent the exact opposite has happened” Bernal told the commission. (Her which lasted a little more than two minutes aired in full on C-SPAN.)On Sunday a mass email from Zogby via Our Revolution summed up: “We are fighting for racial social economic and environmental justice. The Democratic Party needs everyone regardless of their race religion gender sexual orientation age ability country of origin language or socioeconomic status to be deeply involved in order to change the course of this country.”For those reasons he added “we are calling for an end to superdelegates open primaries and caucuses same-day registration and more transparent fair and accountable leadership at the helm of the DNC.” the commission approved some recommendations that were partial victories for progressives. Among the most notable: It called for reducing the number of notoriouslysuperdelegates to the national convention from 712 to about 300 while the only democratic number would be zero. It somewhat improved transparency for often-dubious DNC contracts withand vendors while defeating sensible amendments by commission member Nomiki Konst -- whoabout the need to clamp down on financial conflicts of interest among DNC decision-makers.The eight Sanders appointees -- Konst Zogby Larry Cohen Lucy Flores Jane Kleeb Gus Newport Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver -- put up a good fight as members of the Unity Reform Commission. They were outnumbered and on key issues were often outvoted by the 13 who’d been selected by Clinton or Perez. Next year the odds to overcome will be much worse.With the purged Rules and Bylaws Committee now overwhelmingly stacked against progressives only massive pressure from the grassroots will be able to sustain momentum toward a democratic Democratic Party. Meanwhile corporate forces will do all they can to prevent the Democratic Party from living up to its first name.,1
"What's at Stake in the Alabama Senate Election December 12 | Freepress.orWhat's at Stake in the Alabama Senate Election December 1Beverly Young Nelson has accused Roy Moore of sexual assault.In order to shed some clear illumination on what is really at stake in Alabama's December 12 US Senate Election I am submitting this pair of letters from two key Alabamans regarding Roy Moore. Alabama may be a long way geographically from California but these two letters brings us closer together!The first from the first accuser of Roy Moore going back to sexual manipulation when she was 14 and he was a 32 year old Assistant District Attorney recently ran in Alabama.The second that of his former Law Professor Guy Martin was also published his in Al.com the largest newspaper media group in Alabama on Sept. 21 just before the Alabama Primary. We acknowledge the high principles of the journalism displayed by Al.com in their originally publishing these two letters and thank the editors there for their courage and their integrity in leading this effort and making clear as they put it recently that they don't want to be ""on the wrong side of History.""Letter from Leigh Corfman to Roy Moore:When the Washington Post approached me about what you did to me as a child I told them what happened just as I had told family and friends years before. I stand by every word.You responded by denying the truth. You told the world that you didn't even know me. Others in recent days have had the decency to acknowledge their hurtful actions and apologize for similar behavior but not you.So I gave an interview on television so that people could judge for themselves whether I was telling the truth. You sent out your spokesmen to call me a liar. Day after day.Finally last night you did the dirty work yourself. You called me malicious and you questioned my motivation in going public.I explained my motivation on the Today show. I said that this is not political for me this is personal. As a 14-year old I did not deserve to have you a 32-year old prey on me. I sat quietly for too long out of concern for my family. No more.I am not getting paid for speaking up. I am not getting rewarded from your political opponents. What I am getting is stronger by refusing to blame myself and speaking the truth out loud.The initial barrage of attacks against me voiced by your campaign spokespersons and others seemed petty so I did not respond.But when you personally denounced me last night and called me slanderous names I decided that I am done being silent. What you did to me when I was 14-years old should be revolting to every person of good morals. But now you are attacking my honesty and integrity. Where does your immorality end?I demand that you stop calling me a liar and attacking my character. Your smears and false denials and those of others who repeat and embellish them are defamatory and damaging to me and my family.I am telling the truth and you should have the decency to admit it and apologize.A lesson on Roy MooreBy his former law school professor Guy V. Martin Jr. who has lectured on legal issues including as Adjunct Professor at the University of Alabama School of Law and teacher at the Birmingham School of Law and worked extensively on projects such as the Turf Club downtown hotels (the PickWick complex Redmont and Tutwiler) Crossplex and various public ventures including several with his cousin the late David Vann former Mayor of Birmingham during the Arrington years. He is semi-retired and serves as a Director of The Foundry Ministries.As a practicing lawyer since 1974 lay minister Vietnam veteran Roy Moore's teacher at Alabama School of Law and close observer of Justice Moore's two tenures on the Alabama Supreme Court I feel compelled to share some concerns.As a preface I share Justice Moore's devotion to the Ten Commandments and am thrilled for any public person to espouse the values we share. So are those who twice removed Justice Moore as Chief Justice: many are devout Christians.That said when you vote Tuesday you might consider the following:One: Roy Moore did not get along with his colleagues in law school or on the Supreme Court. The arguments were not over Christianity.In law school the arguments arose from what Disraeli called ""falling into a deep groove of illogic and being helpless to allow reason to pull you out."" If Moore's analysis of a case was tantamount to thinking 1 + 1 = 3 and his classmates reasoned otherwise there was no backing down by Moore. The class was willing to fight to the death against illogic that no legal mind but one in America would espouse.Moore never won one argument and the debates got ugly and personal. The result: gone was the fulfillment a teacher hopes for in the still peace of logic and learning. I had no choice but to abandon the Socratic method of class participation in favor of the lecture mode because of one student: Roy Moore.Two: As Chief Justice Moore continued that trend. He violated years of precedent established by Jefferson who once wrote that he only hoped he could serve our country like Christ wanted him to. Yet Jefferson fought to ingrain the principle of religious freedom in our Constitution at a time of state-sponsored churches and religious persecution. If you were Baptist your taxes supported other churches and you often were persecuted. If Moore's actions were lawful a chief justice could flaunt Islamic or Buddhist icons in schools and authorize probate judges to deny marriage licenses to scarf-less women as contrary to Sharia law.His colleagues tried to reason with him but he couldn't get it: the world experience backed by an ocean of blood soaking battlefields across our earth-and religious wars were not ancient events during Jefferson's times-proves that the way to run a country is with tolerance. Do we need God in America? Absolutely. Let Moore devote his life to converting every American to Christianity-I'm for that-and that still does not eliminate the risk of persecution unless all are members of the same church. Baptists could be persecuted just like they were before our constitution. Christian men smarter than Moore including titans such as Jefferson Franklin and Madison would use a far sharper pen in dealing with Moore.Three: The conservative cause is seeing fragile times. I serve an organization dedicated to promoting free enterprise and desperately want to see change including as one of many examples elimination of regulations choking our nation's spirit. To help this nation change we will need senators who get along. Who can convince.This is not an endorsement of Strange or Jones. This is a wake-up call: the instant Moore wins the runoff is the instant his tarnished reputation as a twice-removed Chief Justice will scald the airwaves of CNN and MSNBC.The DNC will pour money into the campaign coffers of Doug Jones smelling blood in solid Democratic support for Jones and from moderate Republicans.In Washington Moore would be Senator Irrelevant the poster child for stubborn resistance to common sense legislation such as repeal of ObamaCare and decrease in taxes standing on some piece of sideways' thinking nobody in or outside the Swamp would respect.A vote for Moore will be a vote for Doug Jones and against the conservative cause.",1

The special election to fill the vacated U.S. Senate seat of Jeff Sessions now Trump’s attorney general will pit Judge Roy Moore against Doug Jones a moderate Democrat.. His raucous career has been defined by race hate and Biblical babble. His Deep South defeat would signal the failure of Trumpism’s core bigotry on its ancestral soil. It would also swing a crucial seat in the U.S. Senate significantly altering the balance of national power.Alabama is about a quarter black. To win there the Democrats must confront a computerized Jim Crow assault aimed at disenfranchising blacks. With a Republican governor and secretary of state the Democrats must painstakingly monitor every ballot electronic and otherwise.Alabama’s electoral system now features electronic machines that in many cases offer a ballot image that can be recounted. In a close race these could make all the difference.But the Democrats have been slow to act.Virginia Democrats were urged by election protection activists to prepare for legal action in case a close vote proved vulnerable to theft. But according to a leader of Progressive Democrats of America who was active in the fight on election night the party did no such thing.Furthermore one NAACP organizer in Virginia complained that the party failed to contact key black senior centers to ensure that elders came out to vote. A group calledferried black voters to the polls.In Alabama the party will have to do better in mobilizing its grass-roots supporters and will need every pixel possible from the state’s electronic voting machines.In recent congressional elections in Montana and Georgia Democratic candidates lost close vote counts that might well have been rigged. Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson along with numerous expertsthat the June race in Atlanta conceded by Democrat Jon Ossoff was stolen.Given the Virginia/New Jersey rejection of hate Alabama is now in play.

Flake Makes Fake News With “Biting Speech” That Doesn’t Bite | Freepress.orFlake Makes Fake News With “Biting Speech” That Doesn’t BitIN BITING SPEECH FLAKE DENOUNCES ‘RECKLESS’ TRUMP  — New York Times headline October 25 201on October 24 was a seventeen-minute Senate floor speech to announce that he would not run for re-election all gussied up with at least implied imprecations against a president and administration he could not bring himself to call by name. In seventeen minutes Flake managed to find fault with nothing more specific in the world today than “our disunion … the indecency of our discourse … the coarseness of our leadership … the compromise of our moral authority.”Tasty bait there for anyone who wants to see what anyone wants to see. The Times was not alone in taking the bait as a “biting speech.” Others called it a “bombshell Senate speech” () “most important speech of 2017” () “an indictment of Trump supporters” () “powerful indictment of Trump” () “a blistering speech” () “cowardly attack on Trump” () “a fiery sermon decrying Trump personally” () and so on across the political spectrum with a few exceptions likeexplaining why the “speech was meaningless.”Flake himself gave the game away early for anyone paying close attention. Flake’s third paragraph begins with a classic deceit: that everyone is at fault — suggesting that no one is at fault — which is a construction that manages to tell two lies at once:Regret for the compromise of our moral authority and by our I mean all of our complicity in this alarming and dangerous state of affairs. It is time for our complicity and our accommodation of the unacceptable to end.This is vacuity posing as seriousness. This is emptiness trying to pass for gravitas. And it apparently fooled Senator Patrick Leahy Democrat of Vermont who wrote his constituents that Flake's speech was “a remarkable and powerful reflection on the current administration and the Bannon wing of the Republican party.” Did Leahy actually read the speech carefully or just appropriate its vagueness for his own political purposes? Flake does not mention Bannon or anyone in the administration by name. Flake names the Republican Party only once in reference to Teddy Roosevelt. Flake also names Abraham Lincoln. Otherwise he names no names. And Leahy calls this “remarkably blunt.”This kind of broad-spectrum mystification the common inability or unwillingness to call things by their rightful names all seems part and parcel of our dominant present problem: dealing with a criminally destructive presidency — Donald Trump to be sure but also Mike Pence Jeff Sessions Steve Mnuchin Scott Pruitt Rick Perry Ryan Zinke Alex Acosta and all the other empowered trolls that populate an administration carrying out daily destruction of our institutions with no congressional mandate and little media scrutiny.Each and every act of destruction by each of these lawless people is actually an impeachable offense for the president done with his blessing in violation of his as well as his Constitutional mandate (Article II section 3): “he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Tantalizingly but with no follow-up Flake exhorts:With respect and humility I must say that we have fooled ourselves for long enough that a pivot to governing is right around the corner a return to civility and stability right behind it. We know better than that. By now we all know better than that.Flake doesn’t come close even to hinting at the lawlessness and unconstitutionality of this administration’s actions. He mentions the Constitution once referring to Article I (that deals with Congress). Flake gives no hint as to why he mentions it wandering off into quotes from James Madison to inchoate effect. Mostly Flake just twitters on and on about the “tone at the top” and “reckless outrageous and undignified behavior” without a single example. Flake says this is “dangerous to a democracy.” No what’s dangerous to a democracy is a senator like Flake and his 99 colleagues all unwilling to iterate never mind counter the specific ugly behaviors of their naked emperor.Flake’s “remarkably blunt” speech is only such in the abstract. He is blunt about nothing more than his Senate career: “I’m announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019.” And even this is not really news. He’s been under constant attack from the right for his active criticism of Trump. His approval rating in Arizona stands at 18% and he has a Bannonite challenger already in the primary race that he’s“I will not be complicit or silent” Flake intones near the end of seventeen minutes of little more than complicity and silence in relation to anything that actually matters to real people. From beginning to end Flake speaks obliquely in a pastiche of hints and Rorschach blots designed to find real meaning in high-toned vapidity. Flake acts as if tone and manner are the real problems: “we have given in or given up on the core principles in favor of a more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment.” But then hethe anger and resentment without a word about how that anger and resentment is expressed: constant threats against opponents and roughing up protestors but also systemically: police shooting unarmed black people police state ICE raids sweeping up innocents the US policy and practice of torturing prisoners at Guantanamo and elsewhere or any of the other inhumane Republican policies wreaking havoc on individual lives as well as the planet. Instead of honest accounting Flakes gives us a Pollyanna perspective:This spell will eventually break. That is my belief. We will return to ourselves once more and I say the sooner the better.Apparently Flake is lying to us or to himself. Before the day was out Flake voted to betray American consumers by the millions by the hundreds of millions. He joined most of his fellow Republicans in denying American citizens any recourse to the justice system in disputes with banks no matter how corrupt. AsIn the dead of Tuesday night with the applause still ringing in his ears Flake voted to strip the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau of a rule that allowed Americans to file class-action suits against banks rather than being forced into an arbitration process that generally is as rigged as a North Korean election.Hypocrisy is hardly new to Flake. For all his whining about Trump’s tone that tone was Flake’s own tone when he first ran for the Senate in 2012. Behind in the polls in mid-October Flake resorted to an ugly brutal dishonest attack adat the time. Flake’s character assassination of the Democrat who had served in the Bush administration Dr. Richard Carmona propelled him to undeserved victory. And now his Senate career is over. And his overlong announcement of that ending was framed at the beginning and end with these curious remarks:Sustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time….… we must be unafraid to stand up and speak out as if our country depends on it because it does. I plan to spend the remaining 14 months of my Senate term doing just that…. A political career does not mean much if we are complicit in undermining these values.Within hours of saying all this Flake goes and votes to condemn his fellow citizens to a process that denies them almost any hope of justice when a corrupt bank has robbed them. Flake hasRepublicans roughly 90 percent of the time. Flake is wrong about the problem being manners. The real problem is the unremitting corporate attack on real people real programs and real places — and on the definition of reality itself. We will see how Flake performs between now and January 2018. His absence in the interim would produce a much-needed vacuum. More likely his presence will be increasingly heard if not felt. Reportedly he is positioning himself to run for president in 2020. If this speech is any guide to Flake’s campaign we’re not in much danger of a Flake presidency. But stranger things have happened. We have a flakey presidency now.,1
Marine General Shreds Integrity Image in Defense of Trump | Freepress.orMarine General Shreds Integrity Image in Defense of TrumJohn Kelly backs president with lies evasions irrelevancies — not truthat motivated White House Chief of Staff John Kelly to bring himself to the White House briefing room October 19 only toperform something like a self-immolation?He began with abrupt fuzziness:Well thanks a lot. And it is a more serious note so I just wanted to perhaps make more of a statement than an — give more of an explanation in what amounts to be a traditional press interaction.OK not clear what that might mean reporters understood that he was there to defend President Trump’s handling of his suddenlyto Sgt. La David Johnson’s widow and mother of three comforting her with “your guy … must have known what he signed up for.” Kelly is not in the habit of engaging with reporters but he had been a witness to the call. So the next thing he said was:Most Americans don’t know what happens when we lose one of soldiers sailors airmen Marines our Coast Guardsmen in combat. So let me tell you what happens….Wait this is not relevant to Trump’s tone-deaf effort at empathy. Nobody’s asking what happens to the fallen in combat. That’s easily found out by the curious. Why is he leading with this red herring? He goes on with his explanation:Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud puts them on a helicopter as a routine and sends them home. Their first stop along the way is when they’re packed in ice typically at the airhead. And then they’re flown to….Kelly is telling us what’s supposed to happen. He probably telling us what often happens. He is absolutely not telling us what happened to Sgt. Johnson. Kelly had just said “when weone of our soldiers.” That was a tipoff consciously or otherwise. During the ambush Sgt. Johnson and several Nigerien soldiers were literally lost. No one knew where they were for a couple of days. We don’t know who found Sgt. Johnson or how. We don’t know if anyone wrapped his body in ice. We do know that his body was so decomposed that an open casket was not appropriate. Kelly’s recitation of by-the-book treatment of military casualties was not only irrelevant it was misleading. And in the midst of this distraction Kelly tossed in another deceptive aside:A very very good movie to watch if you haven’t ever seen it is “” where this is done in a movie — HBO setting. Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me and it’s worth seeing that if you’ve never seen it.All of a sudden the White House chief of staff isfrom 2009. What’s his point? See Widow Johnson maybe there’s a movie deal in your future? So what wrong with this? For starters the movie isabout the feelings of the colonehome to Wyoming in 2004 complete with fawning media coverage at the time. Sgt. Johnson got different treatment.But then there’s this weird sentence from Kelly: “Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me and it’s worth seeing that if you’ve never seen it.” Syntactically Kelly seems to be saying that it’s worth seeing Phelps 19 getting killed right next to Kelly in the heat of combat — what Kelly apparently means is that it’s worth seeing the movie. But still what is that “killed under my command right next to me” all about? It’s all about a sort of true thing that Kelly distorts into falsehood. Phelps was in a unit guarding a convoy that came under fire. Gen. Kelly was somewhere in the convoy. The official story is that Phelps was wounded while defending the convoy as it got away; somehow he dies later. Another story came from US Naval Hospital. Corpsman Doc Peabody: “I am the corpsman who was sitting next to PFC Phelps when we got hit on April 9th 2004. I was sitting right next to Phelps in the vehicle as the enemy initiated the ambush. I am convinced that Chance died instantly but his head was in my lap and cradled in my arms just seconds after he was hit.”There’s not much of a story in that and this was 2004 when the Bush administration desperately needed heroes to keep selling its travesty of a war in Iraq and PBS was happy to help. And so was HBO. “Taking Chance” is a reverent look at idealized treatment of military dead and generals have been grateful for the sycophancy ever since. Kelly’s long-winded recitation of “what happens when we lose” a soldier is an idealized echo of a Hollywood fantasy sponsored by the Pentagon.In the midst of these layered diversions from what actually happened to Sgt. Johnson in Niger Kelly adds the irrelevancy of how he felt when his son was killed and his son’s buddies called him. He abruptly segued into his half-baked non-defense defense of Trump:If you elect to call a family like this it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine. There’s no perfect way to make that phone call. When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it my first recommendation was he not do it because it’s not the phone call that parents family members are looking forward to. It’s nice to do in my opinion in any event.Kelly went on to say that President Obama had not called him but that “was not a criticism.” Then he said “I don’t believe President Obama called.” Kelly did not mention that Obama invited him to a dinner at the White House. Finally Kelly got to the calls to next of kin of the four soldiers killed in Niger on October 4 again drifting into details of military protocol. And when Kelly finally addressed the substance of the calls he said he advised Trump to use the insensitive formulation that makes emotional sense only to a deeply militarized mindset. Kelly said to tell the dead soldier’s survivors that:… he was doing exactly what he wanted when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining that 1 percent. He knew what the possibilities were because we’re at war. And when he died in the four cases we’re talking about Niger and my son’s case in Afghanistan — when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.So a mind-numbed former general advised his insensitive president to go with a hard truth laced with a self-deception most likely a lie. Kelly just lays it out there: the four dead in Niger are just like his son in Afghanistan. How many ways is that just not true? The US has been at war in Afghanistan since 2001; thehas come as a surprise to most people. Kelly’s son was the child of a general serving his third tour of duty. Sgt. Johnson joined the Army in 2014. He had a wife and family at home and a congresswoman who had known him as a child.It is a common delusional fantasy to suggest that “he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed.” No when he was killed he was trying to survive. The greater glory is all in someone else’s head. In the metaphorical sense perhaps a career soldier like Kelly’s son was doing what he wanted that got him killed but was that true of any of the sergeants killed in Niger? And how would anyone know? Sgt. Johnson hadn’t joined the one percent like Kelly’s son and he had not signed up forthat got him killed thanks to decisions made higher up the chain of command which has been engaged in a butt-covering exercise in finger-pointing ever since. Kelly really doesn’t want to talk about what happened or why the Pentagon won’t say what happened or why the Pentagon and Niger military have different versions of what happened or who was responsible for four dead Americans and uncounted (by the US) Nigerien soldiers all travelling in unarmored non-military vehicles.Contrary to Kelly’s kneejerk rainbow patriotism Sgt. Johnson did not die “surrounded by the best men on this Earth: his friends.” Sgt. Johnson died surrounded by Nigeriens he hardly knew. He had no friends nearby when he died. He was left on the battlefield for two days without being reported missing and when he was found Nigeriens found him. Kelly may even believe the military mythology he spouts but that hardly makes it true or relevant or even decent in relation to Sgt. Johnson. But Kelly doubled down on the shibboleths of coercive patriotism as applied to Sgt. Johnson:… he knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted. There’s no reason to enlist; he enlisted. And he was where he wanted to be exactly where he wanted to be with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.That is the language of emotional numbness that is the lie that lets generals live with themselves and that is a widespread self-delusion that enables the US to go on and on and on killing people in most of the other countries in the world. “There is no reason to enlist” says Kelly clearly contradicting his own rhetoric about service and duty. Maybe his sons felt that way or maybe they had an obdurate general for a father. But even in a volunteer army most soldiers are there because they have no better choice to bring hope to their lives. That’s not a good thing that’s a sad thing — a raw indictment of American culture.Then Kelly launched into his vituperative andon Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida. Kelly flatly misrepresented the Congresswoman’s appearance at the dedication of an FBI building in 2015. Kelly was there; he was a witness to what happened. Four years later his version of what happened was wrong. What he remembered or said he remembered was not what the videotape of the event showed. Not even close. So does Kelly have memory problems of some sort? Does he not have enough integrity to vet his opinions against reality? Did he just lie and carry out a deliberate political smear? He gave us a clue to his state of mind:It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation. Absolutely stuns me. And I thought at least that was sacred. You know when I was a kid growing up a lot of things were sacred in our country. Women were sacred looked upon with great honor. That’s obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases. Life — the dignity of life — is sacred. That’s gone. Religion that seems to be gone as well.A good psychiatrist could unpack that passage for years. Why does Kelly think a widow can’t have anyone she wants to comfort her especially during a cold call from her president? Why does Kelly suggest something sneaky — “listened in” — when the congresswoman was clearly invited to be present and the call was heard on speakerphone by five or six people? Kelly says he is “stunned.” He said that frequently in this appearance. Is this a measure of his insulation from the real world that he expects everyone to live by some unspoken military code?And then there’s the bombshell about being a kid growing up and things being sacred. He grew up in Boston where one of the demonstrably sacred things was white racism. Kelly doesn’t mention that. He starts with the male chauvinist classic: “Women were sacred.” Right especially Catholic women for whom autonomy was all but a venal sin. Kelly turned 10 in 1960 and was apparently stunned to see his sacred cows challenged: women’s rights civil rights human rights and peace activism. Ironically Kelly’s life in the sixties including hitchhiking cross-country riding freight trains back and joining the Merchant Marine where his first overseas trip was taking beer to Vietnam. He even chose to avoid the draft — but it was by joining the Marines.And now here he is saying that women are no longer “looked upon with great honor … as we see from recent cases.” He names no one but this skates stunningly close to his pussy-grabbing boss. He laments the loss of “the dignity of life” by which he presumably means a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions. A broader meaning of ”the dignity of life” is hardly possible for a man whose career depends on killing people. Kelly’s career is prima facie evidence of his complicity in torture and other war crimes including the use of depleted uranium weapons white phosphorous and the indiscriminate killing of civilians. All those are virtually sacred to the military mentality. Kelly laments the loss of religion but that’s his religion and it’s far from gone.Answering a few questions after his statement Kelly bobbed and weaved about the Niger mission that got Sgt. Johnson killed. Kelly keeps saying how wonderful our soldiers are doing what they do. He offers not a shred of apparent regret at their deaths. As Kelly sees it with stunning incoherence and self-contradiction American soldiers:… put on the uniform go to where we send them to protect our country. Sometimes they go in large numbers to invade Iraq and invade Afghanistan. Sometimes they’re working in small units working with our partners in Africa Asia Latin America helping them be better…. That’s why they’re out there whether it’s Niger Iraq or whatever. We don’t want to send tens of thousands of American soldiers and Marines in particular to go fight.So why do we send them to fight anyway to fight and die in wars that never end wars that never should have begun? Why do we threaten new wars with North Korea or Iran or even Russia? How does that “protect our country” exactly? Kelly’s “patriotic” delusions are widely held. They’ve been driving national policy for decades and on steroids since 9/11. But like Kelly’s appearance in the press room the expression of these delusions never makes sense; they always come down to a question of faith preferably blind faith. And with that as we see in Kelly goes a sense of priesthood a sense of superiority masked by disingenuous false humility:We don’t look down upon those of you who that haven’t served. In fact in a way we’re a little bit sorry because you’ll have never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kinds of things our service men and women do — not for any other reason than they love this country. So just think of that.Yes think of that. Think of what our service men and women do not only in Afghanistan Iraq or Syria but also in less closely observed places like Okinawa El Salvador or Yemen.

"UVA’s Miller Center Plans Three Days of Russophobia | Freepress.orUVA’s Miller Center Plans Three Days of RussophobiEven as some Democrats are at long last growing frustrated with the lack of actual evidence for the past several months of stories about Russia stealing a U.S. election Russiagate has penetrated so deeply that Trump's ambassador to the United Nations hasRussia's alleged crimes to be acts of war. That Russia's fictional actions being warfare would make Donald Trump guilty of treason is really a minor glitch not to be fretted over if we step back and view the situation calmly and wisely from the point of view of the weapons dealers.The University of Virginia's Miller Center has hardly met a war criminal it didn't love. It's now planning""Since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 the United States and Russia have been geopolitical and ideological rivals.""That's one way of noting that the U.S. and its allies immediately sent their militaries into Russia to fight against the revolution -- an action which had absolutely nothing to do with defending the United States or upholding the rule of law or preventing genocide or expanding women's rights or spreading democracy or respecting national sovereignty or any of the other pieces of nonsense put forward as excuses for wars these days. In fact this warmaking was a blatant violation of the sixth of Wilson's 14 Points and of each of the first five general Points as well.""In aftermath of the First World War the Bolshevik challenge to American ideals of democratic capitalism set the tone for the rest of the century.""So the U.S. sending troops into Russia didn't set any tones but the Bolsheviks' disagreements with the ""democratic capitalism"" that is working out so well for us did that.""Despite a period of partnership during the great war against Hitler the USA and the USSR viewed one another with deep suspicion and eventually came to see the other as an existential threat. Even with the collapse of the Cold War order America and Russia could not develop a stable mutually beneficial relationship and since the advent of Vladimir Putin to power in 2000 the relationship has reached a level of mutual enmity not seen since the depths of the Cold War.""Putin huh? His offer of friendship and support and gift of a memorial following September 11 2001 his willingness to help with a U.S.-led attack on Afghanistan just doesn't exist? We have to jump straight to the decline in relations that began when Putin would not support attacking Iraq and pretend it happened three years earlier? Boy was he wrong about attacking Iraq eh? That sure has paid off big time and set a moral standard for a world full of slimy rivals. (That the year 2000 is the wrong date on which to begin the ""enmity"" is acknowledged byof the Miller Center's articles.)""This conference aims to place the current US-Russia relationship into broad historical context by returning to key historical moments of crisis and controversy as well as restraint and compromise. By exploring U.S. presidents and their ties to Russian and Soviet leaders and by analyzing the perceptions of the latter we hope to illuminate the real nature of the bilateral relationship: the underlying forces ideological geopolitical strategic historic—that have placed the United States and Russia at cross-purposes for the past century.""Sure you do. In preparation the center has published several articles online. Here's the conclusion ofthat begins with Wilson and Lenin:""Putin we are told sees international politics as a great power game governed by that old Thucydidean maxim that might makes right.""Never mind by whom we are told this and what value it may have!""This was precisely the logic of the pre-1919 world order that both Wilson and Lenin rejected. They both wanted a world governed by norms and institutions of international cooperation; they founded the League of Nations and the Third International after all around the same time. Wilson of course wanted an order that reflected the principles of democratic capitalism and Lenin those of Communist internationalism. Both however would have rejected Putinism as an abomination.""Putin is very quickly transformed into ""Putinism"" on the basis of what ""we are told"" and then denounced as an ""abomination."" Egad! What can we do to avoid this abomination?""The United States then has two choices in its general posture toward Russia today. One is to accept Putin’s premise and shape its policy based on the principles of great power politics. Washington still enjoys vast economic and military superiority over Moscow and this combined with America’s favorable geostrategic position gives it considerable leverage. Such a strategy however would require a clear definition of strategic priorities and some recognition however distasteful of Russia’s perceived interests in its own near abroad. As much as Washington opposes Russian involvement in Ukraine for example or a potential incursion into the Baltics how far is it really willing to go to stop them?""The second choice is to adopt a more principled Wilsonian perspective as Wilson himself did toward Lenin. In this scheme Putin’s refusal to abide by the international norms and institutions crafted after 1945 under US influence (if sometimes flouted by US policies) would render his regime internationally illegitimate. The United States would rally like-minded allies (presumably mainly in Europe) to tighten economic sanctions and further reduce diplomatic contacts.""This festering turd of an analysis was produced by Erez Manela of Harvard ""No Whistleblowers Allowed!"" University. The proposal to be clear is for the United States with more wars and overthrows than it can keep track of having utterly destroyed Iraq having turned the Middle East into a terrorism factory in the process of starving the entire population of Yemen should use moral pressure to urge Russia to start complying with the norms of good civilized cooperative behavior.comes from Eugene B. Rumer of the Carnegie Endowment for International ""Peace"" who gently hints at the possibility of questioning the wisdom of having expanded NATO before concluding: ""In retrospect it was a sensible approach to take during that time."" Rumer also tells us that the reason for hostile U.S.-Russian relations is all Russia's fault and good justification for U.S. hostility:""The standard answer these days in Washington is because of Russian interference in our 2016 presidential election because of Vladimir Putin’s illegal annexation of Crimea and war against Ukraine and because of Putin—his onslaught on democracy at home and dangerous and megalomaniacal agenda abroad. Each of these is a serious charge capable of doing serious damage to any relationship between almost any two countries. Taken together they amount to a legitimate cause for a new Cold War.""Then Derek Chollet of the German Marshall Fund of the United StatesAs long as Putin remains in charge there is very little chance for a productive US-Russian relationship and presidents should set expectations accordingly. . . . The United States should not be afraid of isolating Russia or plainly stating that it will work to contain Russia’s aspirations.""Well that ought to help things.professor of international history at the London School of Economics""Putin like Brezhnev is deeply illiberal. He respects force and supports militarism venerates 'Great Fatherland war' and promotes state patrimonialism. Yet he is much more than a Soviet 'KGB man.' He had a steep learning curve when the Soviet state was destroyed and Russia was flooded by the realities of political and economic liberalization. He accepted fundamental failure of Communism as economic and ideological doctrine and does not want to rebuild a territorial Soviet empire. His project is to improve Russia's place in the existing world order not to create a new one. And his idea of power is closer to what he perceives Arab sheiks China and Latin American politics to be than to the tsars and the commissars.""It's remarkable how little any of these demonizers of Putin even mention the existence of Donald Trump.In a nod to fact-based reality the Miller Center has included one article by Allen Lynch professor of politics at the University of Virginiathat beyond Russia's refusal to back an attack on Iraq in 2003 a big cause of animosity was the way in which the U.S. played Russia and other nations at the U.N. in 2011 when it pretended it wanted to attack Libya merely to prevent a fictional threat of genocide but immediately proceeded to overthrow the government. It was this experience that led Russia to take a very different approach to U.S. actions in Syria.Even Lynch however brings up the ""Ukraine crisis"" without ever mentioning the U.S. role in creating it. He does however acknowledge a Russian perspective:""So long as countries like Ukraine and Georgia remain eligible for NATO membership Moscow cannot assume that it can provide for its security at the negotiating table with Washington.""That's reality. I don't expect it to get in the way of the Miller Center's work.",1
How Gore Kerry and Clinton Put Trump in Office | Freepress.orHow Gore Kerry and Clinton Put Trump in OfficeAmidst the hellish chaos of the Donald Trump catastrophe it’s more essential than ever to understand how he got into the White House and who put him there. Then we need to make sure it doesn’t happen again.In her recent blame-everybody-else-while-doing-nothing screed “What Happened” Hillary Clinton fingers James Comey the Russians and Bernie Sanders.But in fact Hillary Clinton Al Gore and John Kerry put this madman in office.This trio of multi-millionaire corporate Democrats won the presidential races of 2000 2004 and 2016. Then they lay down said hardly a word and did even less as they let George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump rule the land.All three presidencies were stolen by stripping large numbers of black Hispanic Asian-American and young citizens from the voter rolls and then electronically flipping the vote count. In 2000 and 2016 the thefts were finalized by the Electoral College.Along the way the United States House Senate and a thousand state federal and local offices also have been flipped. The Supreme Court has come along for the ride.The impacts—eight years of George W. Bush and an eternity of Donald Trump—have been somewhere between catastrophic and apocalyptic.We will recover only if we do what the corporate Democrats have not: Face up to how our entire electoral system has been become a sham and then change it.Let’s start with Al Gore and Florida 2000.In 2000 Gore was duly elected president of the United States. He won the popular vote nationwide by more than 500000 ballots. Later independent assessments showed he rightfully won Florida which would have given him a majority in the Electoral College.Officially Gore lost Florida by 537 votes. In its infamous 5-4 Bush v. Gore decision the Supreme Court stopped the recount that might have given Gore the presidency. The deciding vote was cast by Clarence Thomas. Gore as a U.S. senator had voted to put him on the bench.But then-Gov. Jeb Bush George’s brother and son of the former head of the Central Intelligence Agency actuallythe legitimate citizen votes that would have won Gore the presidency. In shifting Florida from Gore to George W. Bush Jeb Bush used a wide array of strategies perfected by their father at the CIA for overthrowing Third World regimes that American corporate interests deemed inconvenient. Florida 2000 was the logical follow-up. Jeb used the ChoicePoint computer program to strip some 90000 mostly black and Hispanic citizens from the voter rolls. As reported by activist some 20000 votes were electronically bounced around in Volusia County and elsewhere. At critical points on election night they kept Bush2’s chances alive.About 50000 votes were tallied for the great consumer activist Ralph Nader in Florida 2000. Corporate Democrats stillfor daring to run at all. That pubic assault has shifted the focus away from how the election was actually stolen while undercutting America’s most effective corporate critic. In the perennial war waged by corporate Democrats against social democrats this has been the new millennium’s centerpiece.But had Nader not run and had all who voted for him tried to vote for Gore Bush still would have become president. With computerized stripping of the voter rolls and electronic flipping of the vote count Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris showed that a governor and secretary of state can take any reasonably close statewide vote and engineer whatever outcome they want.Until very recently Al Gore never publicly challenged the existence of the Electoral College which was originally formed in part to empower slave owners. He was the fifth presidential candidate to rightfully win an election but lose the White House.After 17 years Gore still has not confronted publicly the issue of Jeb Bush’s stripping the voter registration rolls or flipping the electronic vote count. Gore has never used his considerable public persona or immense personal wealth to open a public dialog about that election’s corrupted outcome—or to work to make sure it doesn’t happen again.Indeed while presiding over the U.S. Senate as vice president Gore crushed a legitimate challenge to Florida’s stolen Electoral College delegation that put the GOP in the White House.Gore has since got a Nobel Prize for his work on climate change. But his actions were the first inconvenient steps to a Trump administration now making climate chaos infinitely worse.Four years later John Kerry followed suit.—as in Florida 2000—the voter rolls were stripped and the electronic vote count flipped. This time the prime perpetrator was GOP Secretary of State today a member of Trump’s “election integrity” commission.Working with Bush2 Karl Rove and Dick Cheney Ohio’s first African-American secretary of state unleashed a veritable barrage dirty tricks to take the Buckeye State—and the presidency—away from John Kerry.In Democratic urban strongholds and college towns precincts were riddled with chaos that was distinctly lacking in rural Republican regions. Incorrect addresses were posted on the state’s official website and polling stations were shorted on voting machines. While Blackwell spread confusion about the weight of the paper stock required for ballots he refused to send usable ones to precincts short on voting machines. As a result thousands of Ohioans—many students and people of color—simply could not vote.Official letters were also sent to “ex-felons” threatening criminal prosecution if they dared to vote even though ex-felons can legally vote in Ohio and many who were threatened weren’t ex-felons anyway. At least 300000 citizens were stripped from the voter rolls nearly all in heavily Democratic urban areas. Some absentee ballots in southern Ohio were sent out missing Kerry’s name.In some Democratic strongholds voters who pressed Kerry’s name on touchscreen machines saw Bush’s name light up. Some who chose Kerry saw that their choice had disappeared by the time they got to the end of the ballot.There was much much more which Bob Fitrakis and I have documented in “How the GOP Stole America’s 2004 Election” atOn Election Day Bush and Rove made one trip out of Washington D.C.—to check in with Blackwell. They made no public appearances and didn’t bother with Ohio’s GOP governor Bob Taft.At 12:20 on election night despite mass chaos and huge lines (up to five hours long) in Democratic precincts CNN showed John Kerry winning Ohio—and thus the presidency—by 4.2 percent of the vote. The projected margin was well over 200000 ballots.Somehow a “glitch” stopped the tally. The “problem” was in a server in Chattanooga Tenn. where the email accounts of Karl Rove and the national Republican Party also resided. They were all managed by Michael Connell a Bush family high-tech consultant running Ohio’s vote count under a no-bid contract from Blackwell. [Editor’s note: Connelldied in a small plane crasin Ohio in 2008 after recently being subpoenaed to testify in a lawsuit allegingvote rigging in the 2004 Ohio electioWhen the flow resumed at 2 a.m. all was flipped. Bush somehow won by 2.5 percent—a 6.7 percent shift. Scholars such as Ron Baiman deemed this change a “virtual statistical impossibility.” Bush’s Blackwell-approved Ohio margin was a beyond-improbable 118000-plus votes much of it from three southwestern counties riddled with chaos.Kerry’s staff was thoroughly briefed on the likely fraud. At noon the next day with 250000 votes still uncounted Kerry conceded. Then he went windsurfing.Kerry has yet to say a public word about what happened in Ohio 2004 or in other states that year where election theft was blatantly obvious. The fraudulent tactics the GOP “test marketed” in 2004 have been used full force right through the “Trump triumph” of 2016 flipping an untold number of critical elections along the way.Like Gore and Kerry in 2000 and 2004 Hillary Clinton was the designated winner in 2016. And like them both she has said and done nothing about the third theft of the U.S. presidency in the first five presidential elections of the new millennium.Clinton won the national popular vote by at least 2.9 million despite a massive Jim Crowperpetrated by GOP governors and secretaries of state in about 30 states. Parallel to ChoicePoint in Florida 2000 they used a program called spread by Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. As Crosscheck stripped voter rolls on the pretext that citizens were double-registered even if their names did not match from one state to the other.Palast estimates that at least 1 million voters were denied their ballots in this way most of them likely Clinton voters who were black Hispanic Asian-American Muslim and young. As featured in Palast’s book and movie “The Best Democracy Money Can Buy” Kobach chairs thein upcoming elections. Clinton mentions Kobach briefly in “What Happened” but offers no meaningful discussion of how his Jim Crow disenfranchisement campaign might have turned the 2016 outcome—or how to prevent it from happening again.Clinton also briefly mentions the Electoral College that cost her the White House but—like Gore and Kerry—gives no indication she plans to do anything significant about abolishing it.She also fails to explore the fact that she won the exit polls in Florida North Carolina Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin—more than enough to give her an Electoral College victory. In all those states the official vote count was deeply tainted with massive registration stripping and widespread electronic flipping.assaults Green candidate Jill Stei echoing Democrat party-line attacks on Nader.Trump’s total alleged margin in Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania was under 100000. As in Florida 2000 Clinton counts Stein’s votes and complains that had they all gone to her she could have won.But she never mentions that she stiffed Stein’s attempts to investigate the obvious fraud in all three states. As Palast has reported more than enough Wisconsin voters werestripped from the registration rollusing new photo ID requirements to flip that key state to Clinton. Infiled on behalf of the Stein campaign Bob Fitrakis has established that Wisconsin also failed to provide transparent electronic voting machine source codes as required by law.In Michigan where Clinton allegedly lost by about 10000 votes some 70000 ballots were recorded without a presidential preference. In the face of obvious manipulation Clinton has never questioned the absurd presumption that tens of thousands of Democratic voters in Detroit and Flint would slog through long lines and official abuse to cast ballots without marking a choice for chief executive.Stein’s attempt to force a recounin Michigan. When a judge ruled Stein lacked standing but that Clinton had it Clinton’s lawyersrefused to support the recounNone of this is mentioned in “What Happened” or in Clinton’s public appearances. The candidate who rightfully won the 2016 election never mentions the obvious stripping and flipping that defined her losses in the three states that put Trump in the White House. Like Gore and Kerry she has never indicated anywhere that she intends to do anything to stop this from happening again.Clinton does however famously attack former FBI Director James Comey and the Russians for allegedly derailing her campaign at crucial moments.Comey’s announcement of an investigation of her emails did in fact put a crimp in Clinton’s campaign. She still won the popular vote and the exit polls in the five key states that could have won her the Electoral College.The Russians may or may not have hacked our electronic voting machines. But it’s abundantly clear 17 years after Florida 2000 that those machinesbe hacked with ridiculous ease and that the likeliest culprits will always be local officials whose access is universal quick and predictable.The Russians may or may not have also released emails showing that Clinton’s cronies on the Democratic National Committee wrongfully sabotaged the Bernie Sanders campaign.Again and again Clinton contemptuously assaults Sanders for his allegedly lukewarm support of her candidacy. But she completely ignores the massive grass-roots social democratic uprising that continues to make him America’s most popular politician.Instead she locked up her boring uninspired candidacy behind the mighty fortress of corporate Democrats who seem to fear the social/green democrats to whom the party must ultimately belong if it’s ever again to take power. She let her personal hatred of Vladimir Putin convince even many of her followers that she might well spark a new Cold War with Russia.Thus she still misses and disses the activist nation that nominated Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 helped him survive the GOP’s strip-and-flip assaults and thus escape the Electoral College death trap.In 2016 the grass-roots “Hope and Change” tidal wave segued into the “Sandernista” uprising. It became the most powerful grass-roots movement for eco-social democracy in modern U.S. history. The latest incarnation is now in a desperate struggle to take the Democratic Party back from the “Clintonista” corporate elite that has gutted it. Its agenda is to turn the party into a force for peace social justice and ecological sanity that can actually win elections.Had Clinton lowered herself to embrace it she might well have overcome a thoroughly corrupted electoral system and kept Trump out of the White House.But as of now there is no indication that either she Al Gore or John Kerry are awake to the power of that movement or to the need to confront an electoral system that strips millions of citizens from its registration rolls flips electronic vote counts and has used the Electoral College twice in this century to elect the likes of Bush and Trump as president.With the corrupt remnants of the Clintons’ corporate-owned Democratic Leadership Council (which Hillary praises in “What Happened”) still in control of the party machinery more than a thousand federal state and local offices have slipped to the Republicans since 2000. Much of that clearly stems from grass-roots disgust with a party run by a dull tone-deaf corporate cabal whose agenda on war trade welfare and more is often indistinguishable from that of the GOP.But much also has to do with the death grip Republican governors and secretaries of state have on the electoral apparatus. In 2016 and 2018 six U.S. Senate seats went to Republican candidates who lost in the exit polls a virtual statistical impossibility. With those races went control of the upper House—and the Supreme Court.Trump’s federal commission on “voter fraud” headed by Kobach with Blackwell by his side is escalating the Jim Crow assault on our voter rolls. Easily hacked electronic voting machines guarantee flipped outcomes. The Electoral College still lets small red states deny the duly elected presidential candidates rightful access to the White House.The reforms we need to our electoral apparatus include universal automatic voter registration transparent poll books to guarantee duly registered citizens can actually vote a four-day holiday for voting easily accessible polling stations and above all universal hand-counted paper ballots to stay where they are cast in translucent containers with clear chain of custody until they can be tallied in full daylight with open national oversight.We also need an end to gerrymandering the death of the Electoral College and an end to corporate money in campaigns.All this seems beneath the corporate Democrats. But without such reforms it’s a sad illusion that the Congress can be retaken in 2018 or that the GOP rampage through state and local legislatures can be reversed.As for 2020 with the current electoral claptrap a progressive presidency is almost certainly out of reach.It will be up to the grass-roots sequel to the Sandernista movement to end this nightmare.If “What Happened” and their timid inaction are any indicator Hillary Clinton John Kerry and Al Gore still don’t get it. That they opened the door for Donald Trump will be their most profound collective legacy.“Truth!” shouts Jack Nicholson at the end of the legendary film “A Few Good Men.” “You can’t handle the truth!”Until they can these three biggest losers—and their moribund corporate Democrats—are destined for the scrap heap of history.,1
America's Jews are driving American Wars | Freepress.orAmerica's Jews are driving American WarShouldn't they recuse themselves when dealing with the Middle East?I spoke recently at a conference on America’s war party where afterwards an elderly gentleman came up to me and asked “Why doesn’t anyone ever speak honestly about the six-hundred-pound gorilla in the room? Nobody has mentioned Israel in this conference and we all know it’s American Jews with all their money and power who are supporting every war in the Middle East for Netanyahu? Shouldn’t we start calling them out and not letting them get away with it?”It was a question combined with a comment that I have heard many times before and my answer is always the same: any organization that aspires to be heard on foreign policy knows that to touch the live wire of Israel and American Jews guarantees a quick trip to obscurity. Jewish groups and deep pocket individual donors not only control the politicians they own and run the media and entertainment industries meaning that no one will hear about or from the offending party ever again. They are particularly sensitive on the issue of so-called “dual loyalty” particularly as the expression itself is a bit of a sham since it is pretty clear that some of them only have real loyalty to Israel.Most recently some pundits including myself have been warning of an impending war with Iran. To be sure the urging to strike Iran comes from many quarters to include generals in the Administration who always think first in terms of settling problems through force from a Saudi government obsessed with fear over Iranian hegemony and of course from Israel itself. But what makes the war engine run is provided by American Jews who have taken upon themselves the onerous task of starting a war with a country that does not conceivably threaten the United States. They have been very successful at faking the Iranian threat so much so that nearly all Republican and most Democratic congressmen as well as much of the media seem to be convinced that Iran needs to be dealt with firmly most definitely by using the U.S. military and the sooner the better.And while they are doing it the issue that nearly all the Iran haters are Jewish has somehow fallen out of sight as if it does not matter. But it should matter. A recent article in the New Yorker on stopping the impending war with Iran strangely suggests that the current generation “Iran hawks” might be a force of moderation regarding policy options given the lessons learned from Iraq. The article cites as hardliners on Iran David Frum Max Boot Bill Kristol and Bret Stephens.Daniel Larison over at The American Conservative has a good review of the New Yorker piece entitled “Yes Iran Hawks Want Conflict with Iran” which identifies the four above cited hawks by name before describing them as “…a Who’s Who of consistently lousy foreign policy thinking. If they have been right about any major foreign policy issue in the last twenty years it would be news to the entire world. Every single one of them hates the nuclear deal with Iran with a passion and they have argued in favor of military action against Iran at one point or another. There is zero evidence that any of them would oppose attacking Iran.”And I would add a few more names Mark Dubowitz Michael Ledeen and Reuel Marc Gerecht of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies; Daniel Pipes of the Middle East Forum; John Podhoretz of Commentary magazine; Elliot Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations; Meyrav Wurmser of the Middle East Media Research Institute; Kimberly Kagan of the Institute for the Study of War; and Frederick Kagan Danielle Pletka and David Wurmser of the American Enterprise Institute. And you can also throw into the hopper entire organizations like The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) and the Hudson Institute. And yep they’re all Jewish plus most of them would self-describe as neo-conservatives. And I might add that only one of the named individuals has ever served in any branch of the American military – David Wurmser was once in the Navy reserve. These individuals largely constitute a cabal of sanctimonious chairborne warriors who prefer to do the heavy thinking while they let others do the fighting and dying.So it is safe to say that much of the agitation to do something about Iran comes from Israel and from American Jews. Indeed I would opine that most of the fury from Congress re Iran comes from the same source with AIPAC showering our Solons on the Potomac with “fact sheets” explaining how Iran is worthy of annihilation because it has pledged to “destroy Israel” which is both a lie and an impossibility as Tehran does not have the resources to carry out such a task. The AIPAC lies are then picked up and replayed by an obliging media where nearly every “expert” who speaks about the Middle East on television and radio or who is interviewed for newspaper stories is Jewish.One might also add that neocons as a group were founded by Jews and are largely Jewish hence their universal attachment to the state of Israel. They first rose into prominence when they obtained a number of national security positions during the Reagan Administration and their ascendancy was completed when they staffed senior positions in the Pentagon and White House under George W. Bush. Recall for a moment Paul Wolfowitz Doug Feith and Scooter Libby. Yes all Jewish and all conduits for the false information that led to a war that has spread and effectively destroyed much of the Middle East. Except for Israel of course. Philip Zelikow also Jewish in a moment of candor admitted that the Iraq War in his opinion was fought for Israel.Add to the folly a Jewish U.S. Ambassador to Israel who identifies with the most right-wing Israeli settler elements a White House appointed chief negotiator who is Jewish and a Jewish son-in-law who is also involved in formulating Middle East policy. Is anyone providing an alternative viewpoint to eternal and uncritical support for Benjamin Netanyahu and his kleptocratic regime of racist thugs? I think not.There are a couple of simple fixes for the dominant involvement of American Jews in foreign policy issues where they have a personal interest due to their ethnicity or family ties. First of all don’t put them into national security positions involving the Middle East where they will potentially be conflicted. Let them worry instead about North Korea which does not have a Jewish minority and which was not involved in the holocaust. This type of solution was in fact somewhat of a policy regarding the U.S. Ambassador position in Israel. No Jew was appointed to avoid any conflict of interest prior to 1995 an understanding that was violated by Bill Clinton (wouldn’t you know it!) who named Martin Indyk to the post. Indyk was not even an American citizen at the time and had to be naturalized quickly prior to being approved by congress.Those American Jews who are strongly attached to Israel and somehow find themselves in senior policy making positions involving the Middle East and who actually possess any integrity on the issue should recuse themselves just as any judge would do if he were presiding over a case in which he had a personal interest. Any American should be free to exercise first amendment rights to debate possible options regarding policy up to and including embracing positions that damage the United States and benefit a foreign nation. But if he or she is in a position to actually create those policies he or she should butt out and leave the policy generation to those who have no personal baggage.For those American Jews who lack any shred of integrity the media should be required to label them at the bottom of the television screen whenever they pop up e.g. Bill Kristol is “Jewish and an outspoken supporter of the state of Israel.” That would be kind-of-like a warning label on a bottle of rat poison – translating roughly as “ingest even the tiniest little dosage of the nonsense spewed by Bill Kristol at your own peril.”As none of the above is likely to happen the only alternative is for American citizens who are tired of having their country’s national security interests hijacked by a group that is in thrall to a foreign government to become more assertive about what is happening. Shine a little light into the darkness and recognize who is being diddled and by whom. Call it like it is. And if someone’s feelings are hurt too bad. We don’t need a war with Iran because Israel wants one and some rich and powerful American Jews are happy to deliver. Seriously we don’t need it.,1
The Tale of the Brothers Awan | Freepress.orThe Tale of the Brothers AwaDebbie Wasserman-Schultz in the middle of a new scandaThere has been surprisingly little media follow-up on the story about the July 25th Dulles Airport arrest of House of Representatives’ employed Pakistani-American IT specialist Imran Awan who was detained for bank fraud while he was allegedly fleeing to Pakistan. The mainstream media somewhat predictably producedbefore the story died. The speed at which the news vanished has prompted some observersto sound the alarm over a suspected cover-up of possible exposure of classified information or even espionage that just might be part of the story that we are now calling Russiagate.To be sure the tale is a strange one with plenty of unsavory links. Thirty-seven year old Awan his wife sister-in-law and two brothers Abid and Jamal worked as IT administrators full and part-time for between all Democrats including former Democratic National Committee (DNC) chairman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. They did not have security clearances and it is not even certain that they were in any way checked out before being hired. Nor were their claimed skills at IT administration confirmed as their work pattern reportedly turned out to consist more of absences than time spent in the House offices. One congressional IT staffer described them as “ghost employees.”At one point Imran brought into the Houseone Rao Abbas someone to whom he owed money best distinguished by his being. Abbas lived in the basement of a house owned by Imran’s wife as a rental property. He may have had no qualifications at all to perform IT but the congressmen in question did not seem to notice. Abbas wound up working on the rare occasions that he went into the building in the office of Congressman Patrick Murphy who was at the time a member of the House Intelligence CommitteeFlorida Congressman Theo Deutch. He was paid $250000.To cover for all the non-working but on the payroll employeesa high school friend Haseeb Rana who actually did know something about computers. Rana reportedly did “all the work” and kept wanting to quit for that reason. It was also against House rules for an IT administrator to fill in for someone else as Rana routinely did since each such employee had be personally registered by the congressman.The Awans and their two friends were all taken on as salaried employees of the House of Representatives at senior civil service level paygrades of ca. $165000 annually which normally is what is paid to highly experienced senior managers or chiefs of staff. Imran’s younger brother Jamal was only twenty years old when he was hired at that level in 2014.The process of granting security clearances to Congressional staff is not exactly transparent but it is not unlike the procedures for other government agencies. The office seeking the clearance for a staff member must put in a request some kind of investigation follows and the applicant must then sign a non-disclosure agreement before the authorization is granted. Sometimes Congress pushes the process by demanding that its staff have access above and beyond the normal “need to know.” In March 2016 for example eight Democrats on the House Intelligence Committeethat their staffs be given access to top secret sensitive compartmented information.It is not known if the Awans who were working for several Intelligence Committee members simultaneously would have been involved or had access to the computers able to pull up classified material being used by those staffers but Buzzfeed in its initial reporting on the investigation of the Awans familyof a Congressman that the suspects might have “had access to the House of Representatives’ entire computer network.” Indeed it is difficult to imagine that that was not the case. In office environments the IT administrators routinely ask for passwords if they are checking out the system. WikiLeaks emails confirm that Imran certainly had passwords relating to Congressman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz as well as to others on her staff.between 2004 and 2016 at their $165000 salary level a sum that some sources suggest to bethree or four times highethan the norm for government contractor IT specialists performing similar work at the same level of alleged competency. Four of the Awans were among theof the 15000 congressional staffers. The considerable and consistent level of overpayment has not been explained by the congressmen involved. In spite of all that income being generated Imran Awan declared bankruptcy in 2010 claiming losses of $1 million on a car business that he owned in Falls Church Virginia that ran up debts and borrowed money that it failed to repay. The business was namedabbreviated on its business cards as CIA.The Awans family also was noted for its brushes with the law and internal discord though it is doubtful if the congressional employers were aware of their outside-of-the-office behavior. The brothers were on the receiving end of a number of traffic citations including DUI and were constantly scheming to generate income including what must have been ato their credit union in which Imran pretended to be his own wife in order to wire money to Pakistan. They were on bad terms with their father and step-mother including forging a document to cheat their step-mother of an insurance payment and even holding her “captive” so she could not see their dying father. Their father even changed his last name to dissociate himself from them.As of February 2016 the Awansfor having set up an operation involving double billing as well as the theft and reselling of government owned computer equipment. It was also believed that they had somehow obtained entry to much of the House of Representatives’ computer network as well as to other information in the individual offices’ separate computer systems that they were in theory not allowed to access. The Capitol Hill Police began an investigation and quietly alerted the congressmen involved that there might be a problem. Most stopped employing the Awan family members and associates but Wasserman-Schultz kept Imran on the payroll until the day after he was actually arrested.Some of those defending the Awans to include Wasserman-Schultz and the family lawyer have insisted that he and his family were the victims of“an anti-Muslim right-wing smear job”though there is no actual evidence to suggest that is the case. They also claim that the bank fraud that led to the arrest in which Imran obtained a home equity loan for $165000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union based on a house that he owned and claimed to live in in Lorton Virginia was largely a misunderstanding It has been described as something “extremely minor” by his lawyer a high priced Washington attorney who has worked for the Clintons personally the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative.It turned out that Imran and his wife no longer lived in the house which had been turned into a rental property a clear case of bank fraud. The Awans hadan ex-Marine and his Naval officer wife who were very suspicious about a large quantity of what appeared to be government sourced computer equipment and supplies all material that had been left behind by the owners. They contacted the FBI which discovered hard drives that appeared to have been deliberately destroyed.The FBI is certainly interested in the theft of government computers but it is also looking into the possibility that the Awans were using their ability to access and possibly exploit sensitive information stored in the House of Representatives’ computer network as well as through Wasserman-Schultz’s iPad which Imran had access to and was connected to the Democratic National Committee server. It is believed that Imran sent stolen government filesto a remote personal serve. It may have been located in his former residence in Lorton Virginia where the smashed equipment was found or as far away as Pakistan. As Imran Awan is a dual-national born in Pakistan the possibility of espionage also had to be considered. By some accounts the Awan family traveled back to Pakistan frequently where Imran was treated royally by local officialdom suggesting that he may have been doing favors for the not very friendly government in Islamabad.Considering the possible criminal activity that Imran and his family might have been engaged in and which was still under investigation the Capitol Police and FBI determined that he should be stopped in his attempt to flee to Pakistan. The charge that Awan was actually arrested on at the airport bank fraud was an easy way to hold him as it was well documented. It allows the other more serious investigations to continue so the argument that Imran Awan is only being held over a minor matter is not necessarily correct.Awans had wired the credit union money and some cash of his own to Pakistan as part of a $283000 transfer that was made in January. His wife Hina Alvi also left the U.S. two months later.by Customs officers and it was determined that she had on her $12400 in cash. She also had with her their three children and numerous boxes containing household goods and clothing. It was clear that she did not intend to come back but there has been no explanationwhy she was even allowed to leavsince carrying more than $10000 out of the country without reporting it is a felony.to Wasserman-Schultz’s iPad he presumably also was able to see the incriminating Hillary Clinton emails. He used a laptop in her office as well that was according to investigators concealed in an “unused crevice” in the Rayburn House Office Building. It is currently being examined by police but Wasserman-Schultz tried strenuously to recover it before it could be looked at. She pressured theChief of the Capitol PolicMatthew Verderosa to return it threatening him by saying “you should expect that there will be consequences.” Initially Wasserman-Schultz refused to cooperate with the police refusing to provide her passwords and not permitting them to open her computers but Fox News reports that she has recently apparently allowed the authorities to do a scan.There is another odd connection of Imran Awan that goes back to the neocon circle around Paul Wolfowitz during the Iraq War. In late 2002 and early 2003 Wolfowitz regularlywith a group of Iraqi expatriates who resided in the Washington area and were opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime. The Iraqis had not been in their country of birth for many years but they claimed to have regular contact with well-informed family members and political allies. The Iraqi advisers provided Wolfowitz with a now-familiar refrain i.e. that the Iraqi people would rise up to support invading Americans and overthrow the hated Saddam. They would greet their liberators with bouquets of flowers and shouts of joy.The Iraqis were headed by one Dr. Ali A. al-Attar born in Baghdad to Iranian parents in 1963 a 1989of the American University of Beirut Faculty of Medicine. He subsequently emigrated to the United States and set up a practice in internal medicine in Greenbelt Maryland a suburb of Washington D.C. Al-Attar eventually expanded his business to include nine practices that he wholly or partly owned in Virginia and Maryland but he eventually lost his license due to “questionable billing practices” as well as “unprofessional conduct” due to having sex with patientby the FBI and eventuallyfor large scale health care fraud in 2008-9 which included charging insurance companies more than $2.3 million for services their patients did not actually receive with many of the false claims using names of diplomats and employees enrolled in a group plan at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington. In one case the doctors claimed an embassy employee visited three of their clinics every 26 days between May 2007 and August 2008 to have the same testing done each time. The insurance company paid the doctors $55000 for more than 400 nonexistent procedures for the one patient alone.Dr. Ali A. Al-Attar fled the United States after the indictment to avoid arrest and imprisonment and is now considered a fugitive from justice. Late in 2012 he was observed in Beirut Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official. Al-Attar is of interest in this case because he appears to have been a friend of Imran Awan and$100000 which was never repaid. The FBI is currently looking into any possible international espionage specifically involving the two men as Awan and his associates clearly had access to classified information while working in the House of Representatives that would have been of interest to any number of foreign governments.The Imran Awan case is certainly of considerable interest not only for what the investigation eventually turns up but also for what it reveals about how things actually work in congress and in the government more generally speaking. I don’t know which of the allegations about what might have taken place are true but there is certainly a lot to consider. Whether the case is investigated and prosecuted without fear or favor will depend on the Department of Justice and FBI but I for one was appalled to learn that the official who quite likely willof the Awans is one Steven Wasserman Assistant Attorney for the District of Columbia the brother of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz. If that should actually occur it would be a huge conflict of interest and it has to be wondered if Wasserman would have the integrity to recuse himself.There are many questions regarding the Awan case. One might reasonably ask how foreign-born IT specialists are selected and vetted prior to being significantly overpaid and allowed to work on computers in congressional offices. And the ability of those same individuals to keep working even after the relevant congressmen have been warned that their employee was under investigation has to be explained beyond Wasserman-Schultz’sAwan had not committed any crime which may have been true but one would expect congressmen to err on the side of caution over an issue that could easily have national security ramifications. And how does a recently bankrupt and unemployed Imran Awan wind up with a high-priced lawyer to defend him who is associated with the Clintons? Would that kind of lawyer even take a relatively minor bank fraud case if that were all that is involved? Finally there are the lingering concerns about the unfortunately well-established Russiagate narrative. Did the Russians really hack into the DNC or were there other possibilities to include some kind of inside job a “leak” carried out by someone working for the government or DNC for reasons that have yet to be determined possibly even someone actually employed by DNC chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz? There are certainly many issues that the public needs to know more about and so far there are not enough answers.,1
In Columbus and across Ohio the fight for $15 is back on | ColumbusFreePress.coIn Columbus and across Ohio the fight for $15 is back oSEIU Local 1 members joined a November 2015 #FightFor15 rally at Columbus City Hall.After a major setback the struggle for a living wage in Ohio has been re-energized thanks to a ruling by a Franklin County judge. In June Common Pleas Judge Richard Fryeblocked portions of Senate Bill 33 passed in December of last year by the Ohio General Assembly and signed into law by Gov. Kasich.Part of SB 331 prohibited Ohio cities from setting a local minimum wage higher than the state minimum wage.  Judge Frey tossed out this and another portion of the law citing the one-subject rule in the Ohio Constitution which prohibits “Christmas tree” bills: legislation with unrelated riders tacked on that benefit special interests.In other words the Ohio legislature is not allowed to sneak minimum wage rules into a bill that has nothing to do with labor. SB 331 was about regulating dog breeders and pet stores. This was an underhanded maneuver to pre-empt cities from setting their own minimum wage without any opportunity for public debate.With this Christmas tree bill the special interests being catered to were Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley and other Democratic city leaders wholobbied the Republican-dominated Ohio legislaturto stop a phased-in $15 minimum wage initiative that was set to go on a May 2 ballot in Cleveland.SB 331 did the trick.  The $15 initiative sponsored by Raise Up Cleveland and backed by the Service Employees International Union was never put before Cleveland voters.The Democratic Party styles itself as a party of the people always looking out for the working class. But it should come as no surprise thatDemocrats worked with Republicans to kill 1in Cleveland. Most of the opposition to raising the minimum wage in Seattle and Minneapolis came from Democrats who hold most of the political power in those cities. Democrats are just as beholden to corporate interests as Republicans are.Judge Frye’s ruling came too late to save $15 in Cleveland this time around. But since thenMinneapolis voters approved a $15 minimum wagin a ballot initiative despite fierce opposition from the city’s mayor and the majority of city council. Minneapolis became the first Midwestern city to get 15. The national momentum for a living wage is still growing and the door has been opened for the fight for 15 to resume in Cleveland.Little has been done to raise the minimum wage in Columbus. City Council members (all Democrats) haveagreed to $15 in principlthat the Ohio Constitution prohibits cities from setting their own minimum wage shifting the responsibility to Republicans in the Ohio legislature to raise the wage at a statewide level — knowing full well that this will never happen.called on Ohio lawmakers to re-introduce separate legislation to ban cities from raising the minimum wage claiming that $15 in Cleveland would “drive jobs into the other 44740 square miles of Ohio.” Similar warnings of job losses were sounded when Seattle raised its minimum wage in 2014. But areleased in June by UC Berkeley’s Institute for Research on Labor and Employment found that Seattle’s minimum wage law has increased wages without costing jobs. Seattle’s economy is thriving while working people are getting a bigger slice of the pie.It is unclear whether the Ohio legislature will try to enact a pre-emptive minimum wage ban in separate legislation. Lawmakers usually attach riders to Christmas tree bills because they are unlikely to pass on their own. A stand-alone bill would get a lot of scrutiny and there would be vigorous public debate. Labor unions and groups likecan bring thousands of working people to the Statehouse to protest such a bill.Ohio lawmakers and Governor Kasich were taught a hard lesson in 2011 after they passed Senate Bill 5. If they need another lesson the working people of Ohio will certainly give them one.Bob Bites Back: The Columbus Way won’t worSocialist feminists occupy Riffe Center call out Governor DeWine on International Women’s DaBreaking down the Columbus bond issues for the May 7th primary electioSocialists progressives demand $15 minimum wage at City Hal#FightFor15 campaign launched in ColumbuColumbus City Council candidates weigh in: $15/hour minimum wag,1
Instead of Trying to Sabotage the Trump-Putin Meeting Democrats Should Support Vital Proposals | Freepress.orInstead of Trying to Sabotage the Trump-Putin Meeting Democrats Should Support Vital ProposalSome leading Democrats in Congress are eager to turn the summit meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin away from avenues for improvements in U.S.-Russian relations even if that means deflecting it toward World War III.reported that “the White House announced that the meeting with Mr. Putin would be a formal bilateral discussion rather than a quick pull-aside at the economic summit meeting that some had expected.” Meanwhile Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer criticized the lack of a “specific agenda” for the Trump-Putin discussion and“the first few things that come to my mind” -- with 10 items denouncing Russia and not a single step to help avert a nuclear war between that country and the United States.What a contrast with another Democrat former Senator Sam Nunn who signed a June 27 open letter that urged Putin and Trump to focus on “urgently pursuing practical steps now that can stop the downward spiral in relations and reduce real dangers.” The letter emphasized “reducing nuclear and other military risks.”But these days apparently the Democratic leadership in Congress has much bigger fish to fry than merely trying to avert a global nuclear holocaust.The Democratic Party leaders on Capitol Hill can’t be bothered with squandering much political capital or sound-bite airtime on the matters highlighted by the open letter which Nunn -- a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee -- signed along with former top British German and Russian diplomats.offered four crucial proposals for the meeting between Trump and Putin:*  “The starting point could be a new Presidential Joint Declaration by the United States and the Russian Federation declaring that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. This would make clear again that leaders recognize their responsibility to work together to prevent nuclear catastrophe and would be positively received by global leaders and publics.”*  “A second step could be to increase military-to-military communication through a new NATO-Russia Military Crisis Management Group. Restarting bilateral military-to-military dialogue between the United States and Russia essential throughout the Cold War should be an immediate and urgent priority. The focus of these initiatives should be on reducing risks of a catastrophic mistake or accident by restoring communication and increasing transparency and trust.”*  “A third step could be to collaborate to prevent ISIS and other terrorist groups from acquiring nuclear and radiological materials through a joint initiative to prevent WMD terrorism. There is an urgent need to cooperate on securing vulnerable radioactive materials that could be used to produce a ‘dirty bomb.’ Such materials are widely available in more than 150 countries and are often found in facilities such as hospitals and universities that are poorly secured.”*  “Fourth discussions are imperative for reaching at least informal understandings on cyber dangers related to interference in strategic warning systems and nuclear command and control. This should be urgently addressed to prevent war by mistake. That there are no clear ‘rules of the road’ in the strategic nuclear cyber world is alarming.”But top Democratic Party leaders hardly give high priority to such concerns. On the contrary: For many months now their preoccupation has been to double triple and quadruple down on an insidious -- and extremely dangerous -- political investment. Party leaders have positioned themselves to portray just about any concession from Trump in bilateral talks as a corrupt payoff.The House minority leader Nancy Pelosi was ringing a familiar bell when sheon CNN in mid-May: “Every day I ask the question ‘What do the Russians have on Donald Trump financially politically or personally that he’s always catering to them?’”“Given their vehement political investment in demonizing Russia’s President Putin” Iin late April “Democratic leaders are oriented to seeing the potential of détente with Russia as counterproductive in terms of their electoral strategy for 2018 and 2020. It’s a calculus that boosts the risks of nuclear annihilation given the very realof escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow.”Days ago looking ahead to the scheduled discussion between the two presidents at the G-20 summit in Germany the home page of thecarried this headline: “Months of Russia controversy leaves Trump ‘boxed in’ before Putin meeting.” The tagline noted that “whatever course Trump takes will likely be called into question.”Powerful custodians of the USA’s hugely profitable military-industrial complex prefer it that way. They aren’t much interested in any course toward Russia other than antagonism if not belligerence. There is enormous commitment to heading off the “threat” of genuine diplomacy and rapprochement.Elite guardians of the U.S. warfare state committed to what Martin Luther King Jr. called “the madness of militarism” certainly don’t want a modern-day incarnation of the “” that emerged 50 years ago when President Lyndon Johnson met at length with Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin. Standing next to Kosygin at the end of their summit at a New Jersey college Johnson: “I have no doubt about it at all” that “it does help a lot to sit down and look a man in the eye all day long and try to reason with him particularly if he is trying to reason with you.”If Trump says anything like that after meeting with the Kremlin’s leader this week you can expect some misguided Democratic partisans to denounce him as a Putin tool.between the United States and Russia on Capitol Hill the efforts to prevent such a possibility are fierce and unrelenting. Ultra-hawks like Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain are among quite a few Republicans doing all they can to prevent genuine diplomacy between Washington and Moscow. But much of the most unhinged rhetoric is coming from Democrats often with the “progressive” label.To sample just how far downhill the discourse has gone in the frenzy to take genuine U.S.-Russian diplomacy off the table consider thisthat a longtime member of Congress with an antiwar past Democrat Maxine Waters sent out a week ago: “When Trump goes to kiss Putin's ring at the G20 meeting maybe he should just return to Russia w/ him &amp; their favorite amb. Sergey Kislyak.”The director of the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center Matthew Rojanskydays ago: “The momentum in relations between the world's two big nuclear powers is now so negative that it really is time to call a halt to anything that looks like further escalation or deterioration.”Yet that negative momentum is what many members of Congress are trying to increase. Words like “irresponsible” and “reckless” don’t begin to describe what they are doing.,1
Democrats Have No Moral Compass: A Case Study | Freepress.orDemocrats Have No Moral Compass: A Case StudThis motherf----r his whole job is to get people convince Republicans to f---ing kick people off f—ing health care. I hate this motherf----r…. I’m glad he got shot I wish he was f–ing dead.The Nebraska Democratic Party removed a party official from his post Thursday after he was recorded saying he was glad U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise got shot and that he wished the Louisiana Republican had died.eems like a pretty straightforward story when it’s framed like that. Turns out there was a lot more going on not all of it clear yet and the Democratic Party leadership missed an excellent opportunity to exercise nuanced leadership instead of what appears to be mindless kneejerk political correctness running scared.This story apparently began to develop June 16 in the aftermath of the shooting of Scalise and others including the killing of shooter James T. Hodgkinson. That’s when Chelsey Gentry-Tipton chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party’s Black Caucusto comment on video of the shooting scene:Watching the congressman crying on live tv abt the trauma they experienced. Y is this so funny tho?...The very people that push pro NRA legislation in efforts to pad their pockets with complete disregard for human life. Yeah having a hard time feeling bad for them.Within hours of the posting Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman Jane Kleeb who is white asked Gentry-Tipton to resign. Kleeb objected to media attention to what she called an internal party dispute. She said it distracted from the more important issue of gun violence commenting simplistically:Anyone who commits violence against anyone is wrong. Anyone who makes insensitive comments about gun violence is wrong. For me that’s the end of the story.to Facebook refusing to resign and writing a long response to a voice message from Kleeb complaining that Kleeb called for her resignation without speaking to her first. Gentry-Tipton wrote: “As a victim of gun violence I understand that today’s events are deeply troubling. I don’t condone or find the humor in what happened.” She criticized Kleeb for acting in haste without learning Gentry-Tipton’s point of view or the context forIt’s also troubling that gun violence affects the Black community in a way that you clearly don’t understand and you are slow to react. It’s also troubling that police violence affects the Black community in a way you clearly don’t comprehend and you are slow to react….These are the issues. YOU DON’T REACT. What you choose to react to is some gossipy snippet of what I said and then call for my resignation. Where was your expediency and compassion when those tragedies befell our community?A day or two later apparently Phil Montag met privately with Gentry-Tipton and her friend who is apparently an “administrative lead” at Conagra Foods in Omaha. Madison secretly recorded the conversation for reasons that are unexplained (he did not respond to emailed inquiries). When Montag makes his expletive-laden comments about Scalise Gentry-Tipton asks him to go public. “I’m not going to f—king say that in public” Montag says. Gentry-Tipton asks him just to say something publicly. Madison asks him “Why are you telling us but not telling anyone else?” Montag stammers trying to figure it out. At that point Madison reveals that he’s “been recording this conversation since you’ve come in so I will publicly release it myself.” That’s the end of the recording. The conversation lasted perhaps half an hour Madison’s YouTube post comprised only the. But that was enough for Democratic chairwoman Jane Kleeb to fire Montag peremptorily from his volunteer position as co-chairman of the party’s technology committee.Whoa what just happened? First it was a technological lynching. Montag’s remarks however over-the-top were spoken in private presumably in confidence secretly recorded and then without Montag’s permission broadcast on the internet to create a minor media frenzy that as it turned out took the heat off of both Kleeb and Gentry-Tipton at least for the moment.OK this is a familiar pattern of sleazy politics except that ALL the people involved here are self-identified Democrats. This nasty little episode is an excellent paradigm of a Democratic Party that has no focus no principles no common sense. Whatever one thinks of Montag’s comments he made them in private and knew better than to say them in public. That’s on the tape. Madison’s ambush of Montag is a betrayal that borders on the criminal (taping in Nebraska requires the consent of only one person in this case Madison). Gentry-Tipton whose initial response to Kleeb shows some character and decency squanders her good will by taking part in the drive-by smearing of Montag. And Jane Kleeb and the rest of the party leadership manage to behave without dignity or discernible principle at every stage of the squalid show.These people act as if they’d rather screw each other than take on the real enemies of the people in the Republican Party. It’s hard to imagine that Montag’s hatred of Steve Scalise was unique in the Democratic Party of Nebraska never mind nationally. But those who had those feelings including Montag knew enough to keep them private while publicly saying all the fake things they were expected to say the sort of fake things Republicans rarely manage to say about the killings of unarmed black men gay nightclub-goers LGBT victims or even the vulnerable people Republican healthcare is designed to kill. When someone shoots at a Congressman the hypocrisy is seamless and Speaker Ryan can “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us” which he would never say about any mere citizen most of whom he has been more than happy to attack continuously for decades.What should the Democratic leaders have done? How about acted with deliberation care thoughtfulness and a focus on what the real horrors are when words are compared to deeds? For starters all the words at issue here are constitutionally-protected free speech. Jane Kleeb might have started with that thought and then explored context and meaning instead of betraying her anti-constitutionalism with mindless political correctness in support ofViolent comments about anyone whether they are an elected official or a kid on the street are unacceptable…. The political rhetoric is so off the cliff of reality I fear where our body politic is headed.This is the language of panic and fear the language of someone who doesn’t have a clear understanding of what she’s dealing with. She doesn’t even manage to be clear that she heardHe made disgusting comments about a member of Congress and we relieved him of his volunteer position of the party on Thursday morning as soon as we saw the video…. It’s a disturbing time in politics. I’ve worked in politics for over 10 years and I’ve never seen such hateful rhetoric from both the right and left.The party might well have wanted to disown Montag’s remarks as well as Gentry-Tipton’s but it could have done so in a mature and nuanced way. The public exposure in both cases involved Gentry-Tipton. Montag had exercised personal discretion in his choice of venues if not in his choice of people to trust. The party could have made distinctions about what was said and how it was said and what was meant. Perhaps the party could have elicited apologies and explanations from Montag and Gentry-Tipton both of whom could have added depth to the public debate. The party ran scared instead as the Democratic Party has been running scared for decades now afraid to take positions of principle even when they poll well.And here was an opportunity to push back against a Republican Party that isn’t challenged on war war crimes torture white phosphorous and cluster bombs police murdering citizens impoverishing the poor destroying the middle class and actually offering to kill people by the thousands with a healthcare bill that is actually a boondoggle for the rich.. And that is not a wish to see him dead. That’s a pointless desire there would just be another inhumane Tea Party ideologue to fill his Young Gun shoes. A Democrat with displine and a willingness to fight back against the Steve Scalises of the world might have responded to this Nebraska hooha with arguments that show courage and a humane belief system. Such a Democrat might say that the party wishes Scalise no personal harm but hopes that his period of recuperation might also include his recovery from his belief that life begins at fertilization that God belongs in the public sphere (Constitution not withstanding) that marijuana is a gateway drug or that women don’t need the protection of the Violence Against Women Act.As Scalise has time to reflect on life lying in his hospital bed he might wonderin support of mortgage foreclosures voted against enforcing anti-gay hate crime laws voted against green public schools voted for more ocean oil drilling voted against regulating greenhouse gases voted for more nuclear power development voted against supporting democratic institutions in Pakistan voted for easier interstate gun sales voted against regulating tobacco as a drug voted against expanding children’s health insurance program voted against removing troops from Afghanistan or why he voted against investigating President Bush for lying the country into Iraq. Almost all of these votes have clear lethal consequences for someone whether women children gays Pakistanis gun victims Iraqis climate change victims Afghans smokers or victims of radiation.There’s no point wishing him dead. Morally he’s been dead a long time already.,1
How Israel Manages Its Message | Freepress.orHow Israel Manages Its MessagThose of us who are highly critical of Israel’s ability to manipulate U.S. foreign policy frequently note how sites that permit comments on our articles are almost immediately inundated with hostile postings that are remarkably similar in both tone and substance. Given that it is unlikely that large numbers of visitors to the sites read the offending piece more-or-less simultaneously react similarly to its content and then go on to express their disgust in very similar language many of us have come to the conclusion that the Israeli government or some of the groups dedicated to advancing Israeli interests turn loose supporters who are dedicated to combating and refuting anything and everything that casts Israel in a negative light.The fact is that Israel is extremely active in an enterprise that falls in the gray area between covert operations and overt governmental activity. Many governments seek to respond to negative commentary in the media but they normally do it openly with an ambassador or press officer countering criticism by sending in a letter writing an op-ed or appearing on a talk show. Such activity is generally described as public diplomacy when it is done openly by a recognized government official and the information itself is both plausible and verifiable at least within reasonable limits. Israel does indeed do that but it also engages in other activities that are not so transparent and which are aimed at spreading false information.When an intelligence organization seeks to influence opinion by creating and deliberately circulating “false news” it is referred to as a “disinformation operation.” But Israel has refined the art of something that expands upon that what might be referred to more accurately as “perception management” or “influence operations” in which it only very rarely shows its hand overtly in many cases paying students as part-time bloggers or exploiting diaspora Jews as volunteers to get its message out. The practice is so involving recruitment training Foreign Ministry-prepared information sheets and internet alerts to potential targets that it is frequently described by its Hebrew name which means literally “public explanation.” It is essentially an internet-focused “information war” that parallels and supports the military action whenever Israel enters into conflict with any of its neighbors or seeks to influence public opinion in the United States and Europe.onslaught inevitably cranks up when Israel is being strongly criticized. There were notable surges in activity when Israel attacked Gaza in 2009 and 2012 as well as when it hijacked the Turkish humanitarian relief ship thein 2011. The devastating 2014 Gaza fighting inevitably followed suit producing a perfect storm of pro-Israel commentary contesting any published piece that in any way sympathized with the Palestinians. The comments tend to appear in large numbers on websites where moderation and registration requirements are minimal including Yahoo! News or Facebook and Twitter.comments are noticeable as they tend to sound like boilerplate and run contrary to or even ignore what other contributors to the site are writing. They often include spelling and syntactical hints that the writer is not natively fluent in English. As is the practice at corporate customer support call centers in Asia the commenters generally go by American-sounding names and use fake email addresses. They never indicate that they are Israelis or working on behalf of the Israeli government and they tend to repeat over and over again sound bites of pseudo-information as when they falsely insist that Hamas was solely responsible for the recent Gazan wars and that Israel was only defending itself. The commenters operate in the belief that if something is repeated often enough in many different places it willgain some credibility and create doubts regarding contrary points of view.That Israel is engaged in perception management on a large scale has more-or-less beenby the Israeli government and some of its mechanisms have been identified to include the Strategic Affairs Ministry headed by Gilad Erdan. The most recent wrinkle focused on countering the nonviolent Boycott Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement is an app called that was developed by Israel’s Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) in collaboration with the Israeli American Council which can be downloaded at iTunes Apple app store and Google Play. The app enables one to tap into “the collective knowledge of IDC students who together speak 35 languages hail from 86 countries and have connections to the pro-Israel community all over the world.”praising the new initiative describes how “in this virtual situation room of experts they detect instances where Israel is being assailed online and they program the app to find missions that can be carried out with a push of a button.” What does it do? In a trial run an Australian business that allegedly refused to serve Israelis was bombarded with negative Facebook comments that reduced its rating from a 4.6 to a 1.4.The Israeli Foreign Ministry has sent a letter out to a number of pro-Israel organizations emphasizing the “importance of the internet as the new battleground for Israel’s image.”in 2013 how Prime Minister Netanyahu’s office collaborated with the National Union of Israeli Students to establish “covert units” at the seven national universities to be structured in a “semi-military” fashion and organized in situation rooms. Studentsas much as $2000 monthly to work the online targets.The serious collaboration between government and volunteerswith Operation Cast Lead in early 2009 an incursion into Gaza that killed more than 1800 Palestinians when the Foreign Ministry pulled together a group of mostly young computer savvy soldiers supplemented by students both overseas and within Israel to post a number of government-crafted responses to international criticism.Many of the initial volunteersa website giyus.org (an acronym for Give Israel Your United Support). The website included a desktop tool called Megaphone that provided daily updates on articles appearing on the internet that had to be challenged or attacked. There were once believed to be 50000 activists receiving the now-inactive Megaphone’s alerts.about a pro-Israel American group called Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) preparing to enter its own version of developments in the Middle East on the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia. E-mails from CAMERA reveal that the group sought volunteers in 2008 to edit material on Wikipedia “to help us keep Israel-related entries … from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors” while also recommending that articles on the Middle East be avoided initially by supporters so as not to arouse suspicions about their motives. Volunteers were also advised to use false names that did not hint at any Israeli or Jewish connection and to avoid any references to being organized by CAMERA. Fifty volunteers reportedly were actively engaged in the program when it was exposed in the media and the program was put on hold.CAMERA is an Internal Revenue Service-approved 501(c)(3) organization which means that contributions to it are tax exempt. Such exemptions are granted to organizations that are either charitable or educational in nature and they normally preclude any involvement in partisan political activity. As CAMERA would not appear to qualify as a charity it is to be presumed that its application for special tax status stressed that it is educational. Whether its involvement in “un-tainting” Wikipedia truly falls within that definition might well be debated particularly as it appears to have been carried out in semi-clandestine fashion. CAMERA might well also be considered to be a good candidate for registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 as its activity is uniquely focused on promoting the perceived interests of a foreign government.The use of Israel’s universities as propaganda mills by the government also raises other significant issues. The growingmovement has included some Israeli universities as targets because of their alleged involvement with the government in the occupation of the West Bank. That the universities are also involved in possible government-sponsored information operations might be an additional convincing argument that BDS supporters might use to justify blacklisting at least some Israeli academic institutions.Every government is engaged in selling a product which is its own self-justifying view of what it does and how it does it. But the largely clandestine Israeli effort to influence American opinion is unique in that it comes from a country which receives more than $3 billion annually from the U.S. taxpayer. We Americans are therefore paying to be propagandized by people working for a foreign government who often pretend to be our fellow citizens but are not. What is occurring is essentially an intelligence operation directed against the United States something that the CIA would have run back in the 1970s and 1980s. That Israel can continue to reap huge amounts of aid and political cover from Washington while it is actively working to make sure that Americans are poorly informed about the Middle East reveals more than anything the corruption of our political class and media both of which appear to be ready to sell out for thirty shekels to anyone with the cash in hand. Time to drain the swamp indeed.,1
Behind the Media Surge Against Bernie Sanders | Freepress.orBehind the Media Surge Against Bernie SanderIt’s routine for right-wing outlets like Fox to smear progressive activists under the guise of “news” coverage. But why the New York Times? And why the special venom for Bernie Sanders?After the horrific June 14 shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise and three other participants in a Republican baseball practice the media floodgates opened for slimy innuendos. Before the day was done a major supplier of the political sewage was the New York Times which prominently published a left-blamingthat masqueraded as news reporting.The media watch group FAIRthat the Times piece “started with a false premise and patched together a dodgy piece of innuendo and guilt-by-association in order to place the blame for a shooting in Virginia on ‘the most ardent supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders.’”It would be a mistake to think that the Times story was only the result of bias inflamed by the grisly shooting spree. A few days earlier the newspaper had front-paged another “news”hostile to grassroots political forces aligned with Bernie -- a de facto editorial masquerading as news coverage headlined: “Democrats in Split-Screen: The Base Wants It All. The Party Wants to Win.”In a bizarre disconnect from electoral reality the article portrayed a party establishment that had lost election after election including a cataclysmic loss to Trump as being about winning. And the article portrayed the party’s activist base as interfering with the establishment’s winning ways.Such Times stories are now operating under a heightened sense of journalistic impunity since the newspaperits 14-year-old ombudsperson position of “public editor” more than two weeks ago -- further insulating its reporters and editors from accountability. More than ever calling the shots at the Times -- the most influential news outlet in the United States -- means never having to say you’re sorry or even justify what you’ve done.Corporate-owned media hostility toward Sanders and the progressive base has been conspicuous and well-documented. That hostilityand never let up sometimes manifested as giving him. When the momentum of the Bernie campaign gained powerful traction as a threat to the corporate order big media efforts to trash him went over the top.At a key political moment last year as FAIR analyst Adam Johnson “the Washington Post ran 16 negative stories on Bernie Sanders in 16 hours between roughly 10:20 PM EST Sunday March 6 to 3:54 PM EST Monday March 7 -- a window that includes the crucial Democratic debate in Flint Michigan and the next morning’s spin.” The day after this onslaught Sanders stunned the elite pundit class by winning the Michigan primary.Now in mid-2017 with no presidential election in sight why is the corporate media hostility toward Sanders so prone to surface?Consider as an example this structural reality: Jeff Bezos the owner of the Washington Post has just unveiled plans for his company Amazon to buy Whole Foods. And Bernie Sanders thepolitician in the United States according to polls is strongly opposed to allowing such huge consolidations of corporate power.For good reasons media powerhouses like the New York Times and Washington Post are averse to Donald Trump. At the same time they remain quite cozy with Hillary Clinton’s political orientation and especially with the sectors of the corporate-military establishment that she represents. Like so much of the mass media those outlets see Sanders as dangerously anti-corporate and way too willing to challenge Wall Street big insurance companies the fossil fuel industry and the like.On a political level the Clinton wing of the party has been running on the equivalent of dumpster-fire fumes since the disastrous loss in November. The party’s establishment entwined with Wall Street and an agenda of continuous military intervention overseas was just barely able to shoehorn its handpicked choice Tom Perez into becoming the new chair of the Democratic National Committee.with MSNBC two months ago Perez and Sanders showcased just how different their politics are. Perez mumbled platitudes Sanders was forthright. Perez spoke about victims of an unfair economy but he refused to denounce or even name their corporate victimizers -- while Sanders was glad to do so.The U.S. media establishment often conflates “populism” of the right and the left as though Trump and Sanders are somehow symmetrical as anti-establishment figures. And as in the case of the New York Times article that appeared hours after the GOP baseball tragedy the Times has sometimes jumped at the chance to draw far-fetched parallels between Trump’s violence-tinged pseudo-populist messaging from the right and Bernie’s humane inclusive messaging from the left.Like it or not the battle over the future of the Democratic Party -- including what kind of presidential nominee the party should have in 2020 -- is already underway. Overall the top echelons of corporate media are oriented toward promoting the Clinton wing while denigrating the Bernie wing. The forces that brought us the disastrous 2016 Clinton campaign are not about to give up.,1

" Buttigieg 37 ran for mayor of South Bend Indiana his hometown when he was only 29. He is a graduate of Harvard and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University.After becoming mayor in 2011 Buttigieg deployed to Afghanistan for a seven-month tour in 2013 as a member of the Navy Reserve. In 2015 shortly before the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage Buttigieg came out as gay in an essay in the becoming the first openly gay municipal leader in Indiana. If nominated Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee.Buttigieg ran for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2017 running as a dark horse candidate with the backing of former DNC Chairman Howard Dean. However Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election acknowledging his long-shot candidacy.Buttigieg married his husband Chasten Glezman in June 2018.Buttigieg has spent much of his time as mayor of South Bend focusing on redevelopment and construction such as implementing a project to repair or demolish targeted properties across the city and adding pedestrian and bike-friendly amenities to city streets.Buttigieg is making the case that South Bend's economic struggles are a microcosm of the problems the country is experiencing. The city saw a declining population due to the loss of factory jobs but it has increased since Buttigieg took office. He has focused on improving higher education and health care in the city.In the video announcing his exploratory committee Buttigieg emphasizes the need for a ""fresh start"" in American politics. He also discusses the issues important to him as a member of the millennial generation saying: ""We're the generation that lived through school shootings that served in the wars after 9/11 and we're the generation that stands to be the first to make less than our parents. Unless we do something different.""Buttigieg has very little controversy around him other than his age and sexual orientation which some consider to be automatic strikes against him.In his first term as mayor he dealt with a scandal at the local police department which led him to demote the first African American chief of police of South Bend.President Trump has not tweeted about or insulted Buttigieg as of now.Sen. Kamala Harris kicks off 2020 presidential run with big Oakland rallHarris was born in Oakland in 1964 and raised in a multicultural household. Her mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris was a scientist from India and her father Donald Harris an economics professor at Stanford University was born in Jamaica. Harris went to high school in Canada where her mother worked as a hospital researcher and college professor. She returned to the U.S. to go to college at Howard University a historically black university in Washington D.C. and then went on to attend law school at the University of California Hastings.Upon graduation Harris stayed in the Golden State and worked for the Alameda County district attorney's office in Oakland. In 2003 she was elected San Francisco district attorney a position that had never been held by a woman or person of color. During her 10-year tenure as the city's chief law enforcement officer Harris spearheaded efforts to curb high recidivism rates among released prisoners and created a nationally recognized reentry program for nonviolent first-time drug offenders. After winning a hotly contested race in 2010 Harris became California's first female attorney general as well as the first Indian-American and Jamaican-American to hold the post. During her two terms Harris' office implemented implicit bias training among officers and defended several state lawyers dogged by accusations of prosecutorial misconduct.After Sen. Barbara Boxer announced her retirement Harris launched a bid for her seat. In 2016 she defeated Rep. Loretta Sanchez also a Democrat in a landslide and became the first woman of color to represent California in the Senate. During her two years on Capitol Hill Harris has solidified herself as a leading critic of the Trump administration known for heras a member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees.Harris announced her presidential candidacon Martin Luther King Jr. Day Jan. 21 2019.In her short tenure in the Senate Harris has compiled a liberal voting record and has overwhelmingly voted against President Trump's nominees for cabinet-level and other administration positions. Along with her tough prosecutorial cross examinations during committee sessions Harris has advocated for criminal justice and immigration reform and has contrasted her platform with Mr. Trump's agenda.Although she opposed the legalization of recreational marijuana during her law enforcement career in California Harris announced her support for the Marijuana Justice Act crafted by Sen. Cory Booker D-New Jersey. The bill would remove marijuana from the 1970 Controlled Substances Act withhold federal funding for states which continue to criminalize the substance require courts to expunge convictions for marijuana use or possession and establish a federal fund to help low-income communities affected by the so-called ""war on drugs.""In October Harris unveiled new tax legislation aimed at the middle class to give families up to $6000 a year in refundable tax credits which she will likely highlight on the 2020 campaign trail.Although she is likely to cite her long career as a prosecutor on the campaign trail Harris is poised to face scrutiny from some progressives for her law enforcement work. Some factions on the left have denounced aspects of her record as a district attorney and state attorney general. Critics have pointed to California's overcrowded prisons and to her defense of controversial convictions to challenge the notion that she was a ""progressive prosecutor.""""If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her she needs to radically break with her past"" wrote law professor Lara Bazelonfor The New York Times.Although Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about Harris the White House has previously criticized the California senator. In the summer of 2018the White House Twitter account wrot ""@SenKamalaHarris why are you supporting the animals of MS-13? You must not really know what ICE does."" Harris has said that lawmakers need to ""reexamine"" the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Elizabeth Warren takes formal step toward 2020 presidential candidacWarren was born in 1949 and raised in Oklahoma where her father worked as a janitor and her mother took a minimum wage job at Sears. She has described growing up ""in a paycheck-to-paycheck family"" that lived ""on the ragged edge of the middle class."" Warren first married at age 19 and became an elementary school teacher after graduating from the University of Houston. She began law school at Rutgers University when her daughter was two years old and she gave birth to a son soon after earning her degree. Warren served as a law professor for three decades and spent 20 of those years at Harvard Law School. Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton were among her students there.After the 2008 financial collapse Warren was tapped to lead the congressional oversight panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program known as TARP. She served as the architect of the2010 financial reform law known as Dodd-Fran. In those roles she became a prominent figure on the national stage and a hero among progressive populists. But her views on the economy garnered plenty of critics within the Republican Party and among Wall Street bankers. Such opposition derailed Obama administration plans to nominate her to officially run the CFPB. Instead sheran for the U.S. Senate in 201and defeated incumbent Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown--her first run at public office. Warren wasfor a presidential run Dec. 31.Warren and her second husband Bruce Mann have been married for 38 years and have three grandchildren. They live in Cambridge Massachusetts with their golden retriever Bailey who came to her first press conference as a presidential contender.Warren has built a national brand as an economic populist and an anti-Wall Street crusader. The 69-year-old senator serves on the Senate Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee in the Senate and has also taken on her own party on issues she cares about. In one instance she helped to derail then-President Obama's nomination of investment banker Antonio Weiss to a top position at the Treasury Department in 2015.Fixing a ""rigged"" economy figures to be central issue of her presidential campaign. ""I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families but others who work just as hard slip through the cracks into disaster"" Warren said in aannouncing her presidential exploratory committee. ""What I found is terrifying. These aren't cracks that families are falling into. They're traps. America's middle class is under attack. How do we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.""During a press conference after announcing her exploratory committeeWarren pushed for more accountabilitin the economy and pledged to go after drug companies.  ""The problem is Washington works great for those with influence."" Warren also came out against political action committees to fund campaigns. ""Democrats are the party of the people -- we join together and we fund our campaigns"" she told reporters. ""We make our campaigns work through the people.""Warren's claims of Native American ancestry which her opponents say she used unfairly to get ahead have been the source of controversy since her first run for the Senate. In an attempt to silence critics --namely President Trump -- ahead of a presidential bid Warren released theresults of a DNA tesin 2018 that showed a tiny portion of Native American heritage along with a campaign-likeabout her family history. The move backfired inviting criticism from tribal leaders and Native American groups. And it raised questions about how effectively Warren will be able to compete with President Trump.The heritage controversy put Warren high on Mr. Trump's hit list. He frequently refers to her as ""Pocahontas"" and while  campaigning over the summer he pledged to give $1 million to charity if she would take a DNA test. He later denied making the pledge once she released the results of the test but has continued to criticize Warren over the backlash to her DNA video.""She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage. That didn't work out too well"" Trump told Fox News in an interview on New Year's Eve. ""We'll see how she does. I wish her well I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her.""Warren frequently taunted Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign and often takes to the president's favorite outlet Twitter to criticize him and his policies directly. Asked by Fox News whether Warren would be able to win the president said ""Well that I don't know. You would have to ask her psychiatrist.""Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand announces 2020 presidential biKirsten Gillibrand born in 1966 is not the first woman in her family to become involved in politics. Her grandmother Polly Noonan was the founder of the influential Albany Democratic Club and was a major player in Albany Mayor Erastus Corning's political machine. Gillibrand the daughter of two attorneys was raised in Albany. She attended Dartmouth University and UCLA School of Law.Gillibrand worked at the private Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk in the early 1990s although she took a brief leave in 1992 to serve as a law clerk to Circuit Court Judge Roger Miner a Ronald Reagan appointee. She served as special counsel to then-HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo in the final year of the Clinton administration. She was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton and worked on her 2000 Senate campaign. Clinton became a mentor to Gillibrand and encouraged Gillibrand to run for office in 2006 rather than in 2004 believing that running two years later would give her a greater chance of winning.Gillibrand defeated four-term Rep. John Sweeney who represented a conservative district in 2006. Gillibrand was a moderate congresswoman and a member of the conservative Democrat Blue Dog Caucus. She supported a bill to withhold funds from sanctuary cities and received a 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. After Clinton left the Senate in 2009 to become secretary of state Gov. David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to replace her.Gillibrand's positions have become more progressive during her time in the Senate.Gillibrand advocated the repeal of the ""Don't ask don't tell"" policy on LGBT military service when she got to the Senate in 2009. She made a name for herself in the Senate by addressing sexual assault in the military. She proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command in 2013 legislation which was co-sponsored by Republican Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Although the legislation failed it raised her profile as an advocate for women.Gillibrand has acknowledged her changed positions on immigration and gun control saying in a ""60 Minutes"" profile in 2018 that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" of her stances while serving in the House.Health care has been an important issue for Gillibrand since entering the Senate. She came out in favor of single-payer healthcare in 2017 and co-sponsored a Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She was the first sitting senator to call for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished a popular cause on the left.Gillibrand has faced criticism for representing cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris during her time at Davis Polk including in civil and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice. She has also been accused of political opportunism for changing her positions so dramatically when she entered the Senate.The New York senator has alienated some in her party with her hardline position on responding to sexual misconduct. She was the first senator to call on Sen. Al Franken to resign in 2017 after he was accused of sexual harassment by several women. A few big Democratic donors including billionaire George Soros have said that they will not support Gillibrand because of her position on Franken.She has also distanced herself from the Clintons. In November 2017 she said that President Bill Clinton should have resigned after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky became public.President Trump tweeted at Gillibrand in December 2017 after she called on the president to resign due to sexual misconduct allegations against him.""Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office ""begging"" for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill &amp; Crooked-USED!"" Mr. Trump. Critics interpreted the words ""begging"" and ""used"" in the tweet as having a sexual connotation.""You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office"" GillibrandJulián Castro launches 2020 campaigwas born one minute before his identical twin brother Joaquin in San Antonio Texas in 1974.

After her election she continued to espouse anti-gay views. In 2004 she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions.""To try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of Hawaii"" Gabbard said at the time according to.

"Warning: Some of the details shared in this piece are disturbing. \u00aVanessa Tyson is one of two women whoaccuse Virginia\u0027s lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assaul. She and Meredith Watson stepped forward with their allegations in February when some lawmakers were calling on Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam to resign over a racist yearbook photo. If Northam had resigned Fairfax would have likely replaced him. Fairfax has categorically denied these allegations.Watch Gayle King\u0027s interview with Meredith Watson Tuesday April 2 on \""CBS This Morning\""\u00aThe Virginia general assembly will meet on Wednesday for the first time in more than a month and Tyson and Watson are calling for a public hearing. They say they want to testify under oath to describe what they allege Fairfax did to them.Tyson a politics professor was the first woman to step forward with her claim that Fairfax assaulted her when they were both working at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. When Tyson met Fairfax she found him to be \""very friendly very charismatic.\""\""Harmless even\"" Tyson told \""CBS This Morning\"" co-host Gayle King. \""He\u0027s told me that he was at Columbia Law School. And I-- and we realized we had a mutual friend\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 So we immediately struck up a conversation.\""\""So you felt you had established a semi-rapport with him?\"" King asked.\""Yes certainly. It wasn\u0027t flirtatious at all\"" Tyson said.\""Did you feel safe with him?\""\""I certainly felt he was harmless\"" Tyson responded. \""There were no red flags that suggested to me that he was a threat.\""Roughly 48 hours after she met Fairfax on the Wednesday of the convention Tyson said Fairfax suggested he needed to go pick up some paperwork from his room at a different hotel.\""Did I want to come with him and get a bit of fresh air and sunshine? It\u0027s you know early afternoon\"" Tyson recounted. She said him needing to pick up paperwork \""sounded completely legitimate.\""\""You\u0027re there in the hotel standing by the door. And then what happens?\"" King said.\""He crosses the room. And you know kind of goes through his luggage finds some paperwork right which is what I assumed we were there for. And good. And then he crosses back around the bed and comes over to me. And I\u0027m still by the door. And he kisses me\"" Tyson said.\""Well I was surprised. I mean I-- like for-- for a variety of reasons I was surprised. But it wasn\u0027t unwelcome per se\"" Tyson said adding \""I\u0027m okay with kissing.\""\""You know and he kind of... gently takes my hands and... guides me towards the bed... And we\u0027re still kissing right? And it\u0027s completely consensual\"" Tyson said. \""He guides me to the bed. And then you know he sits down on the bed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And what happens from there you know-- we start kissing lying down but on the very edge of the bed.\""\""OK so I\u0027m following. And then what happens?\"" King asked.\""We\u0027re kissing lying down. And we\u0027re kissing. Like so our heads are level with each other. And then it was like my neck didn\u0027t work\"" Tyson said.\""It-- it-- it-- it-- it was like I couldn\u0027t-- I couldn\u0027t feel my neck. I couldn\u0027t hold my head up\"" Tyson said. \""He\u0027s using his hand on the back of my neck. And I still didn\u0027t know what was going wrong. I thought there was something wrong with my neck\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And he\u0027s pushing down and pushing down. And I couldn\u0027t hold my neck up. And I didn\u0027t know what was going on. I honestly didn\u0027t know what was going on. And then the next thing I know like my head is like literally in his crotch\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 And I\u0027m choking and gagging. And you know I couldn\u0027t say anything \u0027cause I\u0027m choking and gagging. And so you know it continues for-- and he\u0027s holding my head. So I can\u0027t lift-- like I\u0027m trying to lift my head but I can\u0027t.\""Throughout it Tyson said Fairfax wasn\u0027t saying anything.\""To be honest I\u0027m in total shock. Like\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"" Tyson started.\""Do you say anything to him? No?\"" King asked.\""I didn\u0027t know what to say. I-- I was just-- I was completely caught off guard. It was almost as if I was dumbstruck\"" Tyson said.\""Have you talked to Justin Fairfax since that day in 2004?\"" King asked.\""The next day I remember walk-- it-- it was the last day of the convention. And I remember walking-- you know I was walking towards the staff lounge\"" Tyson said. \""And-- and I saw him in there. And you know he didn\u0027t see me. And I just you know did a 180 and just went the absolute opposite direction. Like I just didn\u0027t want didn\u0027t even want him to see me didn\u0027t want him like-- no.\""\""So you-- you really haven\u0027t seen him since that incident in 2004?\"" King asked.\""No I haven\u0027t seen him\"" Tyson said. \""I remember him trying to call me a couple times. But I-- I-- I-- I just didn\u0027t pick up. This was after the convention was over. And I think he emailed me a few times as well. Like I never initiated contact.\""\u00aTyson said she didn\u0027t tell anyone about the incident.\u00a\""I was so ashamed. I was so humiliated on-- on so many levels. Like here I was this woman working at a rape crisis center you know trying to-- like as a survivor speaker trying to empower survivors of sexual assault. And it was like I had just walked into a trap\"" Tyson said adding that she is a survivor of incest.\""Was Justin aware of this in your past?\"" King asked.\""You felt comfortable enough sharing that with him even though you had just met him?\"" King asked.\""Here\u0027s the thing. What I was doing for the rape crisis center was actually probably the biggest part of my life at that time\"" Tyson said.\""Do you feel he took advantage of you knowing your past?\"" King asked.\""In retrospect yes\"" Tyson said.King also asked Tyson aboutFairfax comparing himself to lynching victim\""Never was it two black women lynching black men\"" Tyson replied. \""One need only look at history to try to understand that in fact the role of black women had always been leading anti-lynching campaigns. You know black women were lynched specifically trying to protect black men. And speaking as someone who teaches black politics I find it disgraceful irresponsible and manipulative.\""\""Is this a racial issue to you?\"" King asked.\""Sexual assault should never be a racial issue. It should never be a partisan issue\"" Tyson said. \""Sexual assault is an epidemic that\u0027s taking place around the world across our country every day.\""King asked \""What do you want to happen to Justin Fairfax? Why are you coming forward?\""\""I\u0027d want him to resign\"" Tyson replied. \""I think the Virginia people the voters of Virginia have a right to know you know both my story and Meredith\u0027s story.\""When asked to respond to criticism that she was participating in an \""an orchestrated smear campaign\"" by her and Watson against Fairfax Tyson replied \""I\u0027ve never met Meredith Watson. I don\u0027t know what she looks like. I\u0027ve never spoken with her.\""\""She also says she\u0027s never met you and never spoken to you either\"" King said. \""And when I talked to her she really fell apart when she said she feels tremendous guilt that she didn\u0027t come forward because it happened to her she says in 2000.\""\""She can never blame herself\"" Tyson said. \""This wasn\u0027t her. It wasn\u0027t me. It wasn\u0027t either one of us. It was Justin Fairfax.\""\""One thing I will say is that it\u0027s hard. I can\u0027t even begin to tell you how hard it is to come forward especially against someone powerful. And when she came forward she didn\u0027t want me to feel alone. And that meant the world to me \u0027cause it\u0027s just hard to be alone\"" Tyson said with tears streaming down her face.\""She feels tremendous tremendous guilt\"" Kings said.Meredith Watson came forward shortly after Tyson had made her accusations in February. Watson   told King that she\u0027s very sorry for not reporting her allegation that Fairfax raped her nearly 20 years ago.\""Why do you feel guilty?\"" King asked.\""It happened to her after it happened to me. And had I had the strength or the courage to say something in 2000 maybe it never would\u0027ve happened to her\"" Watson said choking up with emotion.Fairfax responded to the accusations in a statement to CBS News saying:\""I am and have long been a strong proponent of the rights of women in our society -- among them equal rights reproductive rights economic rights the right to be heard and respected the right to fair access to the criminal justice system and right to be free from disrespect harassment and assault.\u00a0At the same time I also believe that we must find a way to ensure that our justice system and even the court of public opinion provide due process and fairness both to accusers and the accused.I for one stand accused of crimes that I did not commit.\u00aI feel so strongly regarding my innocence that I submitted myself to polygraph tests for each of the accusations against me. I passed those tests because as I have maintained from the very beginning I did not assault either of my accusers.I have also called for a fair full and impartial investigation of the allegations and my denials. I am completely confident that such an investigation would exonerate me and clear my good name which I have spent a lifetime building.My accusers have not filed criminal charges and they have not sued me. Instead we see escalating media appearances and stated desire for a political process that is unprecedented in Virginia and could not be designed to get at the truth. Such a process would instead be a media circus used for partisan and political purposes.Law enforcement authorities in Boston and Durham have demonstrated a sensitivity to those who wish to report a crime. A civil lawsuit as well would provide a forum for assessing the credibility of all parties. Given the seriousness of these accusations and the significant damage that leaving them unresolved will continue to do we must ensure there is a legal forum to adjudicate these matters fairly and make an ultimate and evidence-based determination about the truth.Notwithstanding my own innocence I am aware of the importance that the voices of accusers be heard. For too long women and men who have been sexually assaulted or harassed have been silenced and ignored.I empathize with those who have lived for a long time feeling hurt and pain. And while the evidence will continue to demonstrate the truth that I never assaulted either Dr. Tyson or Ms. Watson I am able to hear the pain they have expressed; a pain I hope they are able to resolve and heal from.\u00a0 However because I never assaulted either Dr. Tyson or Ms. Watson I know that my actions cannot be the source of that pain.In the face of such serious allegations there must be space for due process and deliberate investigation and evaluation in order to find justice. Our justice system is not perfect but I am willing to submit myself to it to clear my name. As I indicated above on March 29 2019 I submitted to and successfully passed -- with regard to each allegation -- a lie detector test conducted by an expert in such tests who is a former FBI agent of 24 years.\u00aI repeat my consistent call for a full investigation by law enforcement in this matter so the full truth can be known. The truth will not be uncovered by television interviews or legislative hearings designed for political purposes. It can best be properly found by exhaustive and deliberate investigation by law enforcement professionals. \u00aWe must all now insist on gathering evidence through an impartial law enforcement investigation and\/or civil legal process in order to get to the truth.\""There\u0027s one question in the polygraph where he was asked whether Tyson contacted him after the Boston convention in order to meet her mother. He said he answered \""yes\"" truthfully. Tyson said she never contacted him after the incident.\u00aApril 1 2019 7:43 AJustin Fairfax accuser Vanessa Tyson describes alleged sexual assault: ""I couldn't feel my neck""Justin Fairfax accuser on alleged sex assaultWarning: Some of the details shared in this piece are disturbing.Vanessa Tyson is one of two women whoaccuse Virginia's lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assaul.

King asked.""In retrospect yes"" Tyson said.Vanessa Tyson: Justin Fairfax comparing himself to lynching victims is ""disgraceful""King also asked Tyson aboutFairfax comparing himself to lynching victim""Never was it two black women lynching black men"" Tyson replied. ""One need only look at history to try to understand that in fact the role of black women had always been leading anti-lynching campaigns. You know black women were lynched specifically trying to protect black men. And speaking as someone who teaches black politics I find it disgraceful irresponsible and manipulative.""""Is this a racial issue to you?"" King asked.""Sexual assault should never be a racial issue. It should never be a partisan issue"" Tyson said. ""Sexual assault is an epidemic that's taking place around the world across our country every day.""King asked ""What do you want to happen to Justin Fairfax? Why are you coming forward?""""I'd want him to resign"" Tyson replied. ""I think the Virginia people the voters of Virginia have a right to know you know both my story and Meredith's story.""When asked to respond to criticism that she was participating in an ""an orchestrated smear campaign"" by her and Watson against Fairfax Tyson replied ""I've never met Meredith Watson. I don't know what she looks like. I've never spoken with her.""""She also says she's never met you and never spoken to you either"" King said. ""And when I talked to her she really fell apart when she said she feels tremendous guilt that she didn't come forward because it happened to her she says in 2000.""""She can never blame herself"" Tyson said. ""This wasn't her. It wasn't me. It wasn't either one of us. It was Justin Fairfax.""""One thing I will say is that it's hard. I can't even begin to tell you how hard it is to come forward especially against someone powerful. And when she came forward she didn't want me to feel alone. And that meant the world to me 'cause it's just hard to be alone"" Tyson said with tears streaming down her face.""She feels tremendous tremendous guilt"" Kings said.Justin Fairfax accuser Meredith Watson says she feels guilty for not coming forward sooneMeredith Watson came forward shortly after Tyson had made her accusations in February. Watson   told King that she's very sorry for not reporting her allegation that Fairfax raped her nearly 20 years ago.""Why do you feel guilty?"" King asked.""It happened to her after it happened to me. And had I had the strength or the courage to say something in 2000 maybe it never would've happened to her"" Watson said choking up with emotion.Fairfax responded to the accusations in a statement to CBS News saying:""I am and have long been a strong proponent of the rights of women in our society -- among them equal rights reproductive rights economic rights the right to be heard and respected the right to fair access to the criminal justice system and right to be free from disrespect harassment and assault.At the same time I also believe that we must find a way to ensure that our justice system and even the court of public opinion provide due process and fairness both to accusers and the accused.I for one stand accused of crimes that I did not commit.I feel so strongly regarding my innocence that I submitted myself to polygraph tests for each of the accusations against me. I passed those tests because as I have maintained from the very beginning I did not assault either of my accusers.I have also called for a fair full and impartial investigation of the allegations and my denials. I am completely confident that such an investigation would exonerate me and clear my good name which I have spent a lifetime building.My accusers have not filed criminal charges and they have not sued me. Instead we see escalating media appearances and stated desire for a political process that is unprecedented in Virginia and could not be designed to get at the truth. Such a process would instead be a media circus used for partisan and political purposes.Law enforcement authorities in Boston and Durham have demonstrated a sensitivity to those who wish to report a crime. A civil lawsuit as well would provide a forum for assessing the credibility of all parties. Given the seriousness of these accusations and the significant damage that leaving them unresolved will continue to do we must ensure there is a legal forum to adjudicate these matters fairly and make an ultimate and evidence-based determination about the truth.Notwithstanding my own innocence I am aware of the importance that the voices of accusers be heard. For too long women and men who have been sexually assaulted or harassed have been silenced and ignored.I empathize with those who have lived for a long time feeling hurt and pain. And while the evidence will continue to demonstrate the truth that I never assaulted either Dr. Tyson or Ms. Watson I am able to hear the pain they have expressed; a pain I hope they are able to resolve and heal from.  However because I never assaulted either Dr. Tyson or Ms. Watson I know that my actions cannot be the source of that pain.In the face of such serious allegations there must be space for due process and deliberate investigation and evaluation in order to find justice. Our justice system is not perfect but I am willing to submit myself to it to clear my name. As I indicated above on March 29 2019 I submitted to and successfully passed -- with regard to each allegation -- a lie detector test conducted by an expert in such tests who is a former FBI agent of 24 years.I repeat my consistent call for a full investigation by law enforcement in this matter so the full truth can be known. The truth will not be uncovered by television interviews or legislative hearings designed for political purposes. It can best be properly found by exhaustive and deliberate investigation by law enforcement professionals.We must all now insist on gathering evidence through an impartial law enforcement investigation and/or civil legal process in order to get to the truth.""There's one question in the polygraph where he was asked whether Tyson contacted him after the Boston convention in order to meet her mother. He said he answered ""yes"" truthfully. Tyson said she never contacted him after the incident.A Twitter List by CBS This MorninWatch CBS News anytime anywhere with the our 24/7 digital news network.

"The Justice Department is expected to send the report by special counsel Robert Mueller to Congress by mid-April Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees Friday.

Barr said that the Justice Department was working with Mueller to identify and redact any information pertaining to national security ongoing litigation and data which would \""unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.\""In his letter Barr also discussed media reports and other public statements \""mischaracterizing\"" his first letter to Congress regarding the special counsel investigation which he sent on Sunday.\u00afour-page letter summarized the key points of the Mueller repor: that the special counsel had determined that Mr. Trump did not collude with Russia during the 2016 election and had made no determination on whether the president had obstructed justice.

Nadler called on Barr to testify before the committee after the attorney general sent his summary letter last week. the chairs of the House Judiciary Oversight Intelligence Foreign Affairs Ways and Means and Financial Services committees said they needed access to all of Mueller\u0027s findings and investigative materials by April 2 to make an \""independent assessment\"" of the probe. Barr\u0027s latest letter indicates that this deadline will not be met.Responding to Barr\u0027s letter Friday Nadler said that Congress still expects to receive the full report by the April 2 deadline rather than the mid-April timeline Barr laid out in his letter. He also said he wants Barr \""to come before Congress immediately to explain the rationale behind his letter his rapid decision that the evidence developed was insufficient to establish an obstruction of justice offense and his continued refusal to provide us with the full report.\""Nadler also objected to Barr\u0027s move to release a redacted version of the report.\""He should work with us to request a court order to release any and all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee\u00e2\u0080\u0094as has occurred in every similar investigation in the past\"" Nadler said. \""There is ample precedent for the Department of Justice sharing all of the information that the Attorney General proposes to redact to the appropriate congressional committees.\""House Democratic staff were already anticipating that Barr would try to withhold portions of the report and have begun preparing the legal arguments they will use to argue they should receive not only the full report but also all the underlying materials Mueller used to prepare it.\u00aIn a briefing Thursday staff pointed to the 1974 Watergate investigation that preceded the resignation of President Nixon when grand jury material was given to the House Judiciary Committee as it was conducing impeachment proceedings. And in 1998 that committee received 18 boxes of evidence including grand jury information from Independent Counsel Ken Starr when he concluded his investigation into President Clinton.Nadler said Wednesday evening that Barr would not commit to releasing all of Mueller\u0027s underlying materials during a ten-minute phone call earlier that day. Asked if he was prepared to go to court to ask a judge to release grand jury materials to the committee Nadler declined to answer but told reporters \""you can draw your own conclusions\"" indicating he is prepared to move forward with a legal challenge.House Democrats will also argue that Barr cannot shield sensitive information from being turned over to Congress arguing that less than a year ago the Justice Department\u00aprovided 880000 pages of internal investigative document\u00a0from its investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u0027s use of a private email server and also\u00agave the House Intelligence Committee highly sensitive document\u00a0related to the surveillance warrant for a wiretap of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.Federal judge blocks Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policFelicity Huffman 13 others plead guilty in college admissions scaEric Swalwell joins 2020 presidential racMar-a-Lago intruder had device to spot hidden cameras: fedPoll: Most say tax law helps wealthy over middle clasSecret Service director other top DHS officials leaving amid overhau3 U.S. service members contractor killed in AfghanistaMan accused of plotting ISIS-inspired truck attack near D.C.Why Kirstjen Nielsen exit won't change ""overwhelmed"" border situatioBarr expects to release nearly 400-page Mueller report by mid-ApriUpdated on:  March 29 2019 / 4:13 PTrump relishes 1st rally after Mueller reportThe Justice Department is expected to send the report by special counsel Robert Mueller to Congress by mid-April Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees Friday.

He also said he wants Barr ""to come before Congress immediately to explain the rationale behind his letter his rapid decision that the evidence developed was insufficient to establish an obstruction of justice offense and his continued refusal to provide us with the full report.""Nadler also objected to Barr's move to release a redacted version of the report.""He should work with us to request a court order to release any and all grand jury information to the House Judiciary Committee—as has occurred in every similar investigation in the past"" Nadler said. ""There is ample precedent for the Department of Justice sharing all of the information that the Attorney General proposes to redact to the appropriate congressional committees.""House Democratic staff were already anticipating that Barr would try to withhold portions of the report and have begun preparing the legal arguments they will use to argue they should receive not only the full report but also all the underlying materials Mueller used to prepare it.In a briefing Thursday staff pointed to the 1974 Watergate investigation that preceded the resignation of President Nixon when grand jury material was given to the House Judiciary Committee as it was conducing impeachment proceedings. And in 1998 that committee received 18 boxes of evidence including grand jury information from Independent Counsel Ken Starr when he concluded his investigation into President Clinton.Nadler said Wednesday evening that Barr would not commit to releasing all of Mueller's underlying materials during a ten-minute phone call earlier that day. Asked if he was prepared to go to court to ask a judge to release grand jury materials to the committee Nadler declined to answer but told reporters ""you can draw your own conclusions"" indicating he is prepared to move forward with a legal challenge.House Democrats will also argue that Barr cannot shield sensitive information from being turned over to Congress arguing that less than a year ago the Justice Departmentprovided 880000 pages of internal investigative documentfrom its investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server and alsogave the House Intelligence Committee highly sensitive documentrelated to the surveillance warrant for a wiretap of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.First published on March 29 2019 / 4:02 P© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

"as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) comes as President Trump seeks to steer his administration towards a \""tougher\"" approach on immigration to confront aAfter CBS News reported Nielsen intended to resign Sunday from the position she has held since December 2017 the presidentshe would be leaving her position. Mr. Trump also announced he was tapping U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner Kevin McAleenan to run DHS on an acting basis.\u00aA prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of former White House chief of staff John Kelly Nielsen had reportedly fallen out of favor in recent months with the president who has been frustrated with an unprecedented flow of Central American families reaching the U.S.-Mexico border.During Nielsen\u0027s tenure apprehensions of migrant families between ports of entry along the southern border have steadily increased since the summer of 2018 and have reached record highs in recent months according to government figures. Immigration authorities apprehended about 36000 families along the southwestern border in February making it the busiest February for border officials in the last 12 years.The surge has incensed Mr. Trump and one his most trusted aides White House senior adviser Stephen Miller a notorious immigration hardliner. The president recently vowed tocut all U.S. foreign aito Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and has repeatedly threatened to close ports of entry to and from Mexico if the country\u0027s government does not do more to prevent migrants from the Northern Triangle from reaching the southern border.\u00aTrump\u0027s move to cut aid to Central America will spur more migration aid workers warApprehensions of migrant families rise dramatically along southern bordeDemocrats and U.S.-financed non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in Central America believe the aid cut will backfire both prompting more migration and penalizing poor and working-class people for the failures of their elected leaders. Economic experts have warned a closure of the border with Mexico will cause significant harm to the U.S. economy. \u00aNielsen has not been the only casualty of the administration\u0027s new strategy.

Mr. Trump joked that world leaders would call him about the move which was globally unpopular and he said he waited to reply to their calls until after he had announced it.The president also raised his administration\u0027s decision last month toas Israeli territory a controversial move that has not been backed by other countries.\u00aMr. Trump has made his support for Israel and its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a key part of his appeal to Jewish voters. Several attendees at the meeting Saturday were wearing red yarmulkes emblazoned with \""Trump\"" and \""RJC.\""Netanyahu -- who has been indicted on corruption charges -- is running for his third term and the election is on Tuesday.

He also accused the countries of El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras of not doing enough to stop people from migrating to the U.S. -- which is why hedirected the State Department to cut off aito the three countries. Critics argue that cutting off aid would worsen the situation in these countries driving more people to seek asylum.\""I\u0027ve taken a lot of heat from the stupid people\"" about the decision to cut off aid Mr. Trump said. \""What about building our own country for a change?\""\u00aHe also reiterated threats to close down the border which could be economically catastrophic for the country. \""I\u0027ll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country\"" he said.Steven Portnoy contributed to this reporFederal judge blocks Trump's ""Remain in Mexico"" policFelicity Huffman 13 others plead guilty in college admissions scaEric Swalwell joins 2020 presidential racMar-a-Lago intruder had device to spot hidden cameras: fedPoll: Most say tax law helps wealthy over middle clasSecret Service director other top DHS officials leaving amid overhau3 U.S. service members contractor killed in AfghanistaMan accused of plotting ISIS-inspired truck attack near D.C.Why Kirstjen Nielsen exit won't change ""overwhelmed"" border situatioTrump addresses Republican Jewish Coalition event in Las VegaUpdated on:  April 6 2019 / 4:08 PPresident Trump addressed the Jewish Republican Coalition's Annual Leadership Meeting on Saturday delivering a speech afterof being ""anti-Jewish"" and ""anti-Israel.""

Mr. Trump quickly pivoted to talking about his support for Israel and his dissolution of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor.""How the hell did you support President Obama? How the hell did you support the Democrats? Well you guys didn't"" Mr. Trump joked alluding to how the majority of Jewish Americans support Democratic candidates. ""The incredible bond between the United States and Israel has never been stronger than it is right now.""Trump spent most of the speech touting his administration's accomplishments and in particular the confirmation of conservative justices to the federal bench.He also discussed his administration's recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the decision tothere from Tel Aviv. Mr. Trump joked that world leaders would call him about the move which was globally unpopular and he said he waited to reply to their calls until after he had announced it.The president also raised his administration's decision last month toas Israeli territory a controversial move that has not been backed by other countries.Mr. Trump has made his support for Israel and its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a key part of his appeal to Jewish voters. Several attendees at the meeting Saturday were wearing red yarmulkes emblazoned with ""Trump"" and ""RJC.""Netanyahu -- who has been indicted on corruption charges -- is running for his third term and the election is on Tuesday. Trump jokingly asked the audience at the meeting how the election was going and who they thought would win.

""They're not afraid of anything. They have lawyers greeting them. They read what lawyers tell them to read.""""The system is full. We can't take you anymore. Whether it's asylum. Whether it's anything you want. It's illegal immigration"" he continued warning migrants away from seeking asylum.Mr. Trump reiterated this message in an interview with Griff Jenkins on ""Fox and Friends"" Saturday morning.""There's never been so many people coming up and that's because they're gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they've done in terms of Congress"" Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump repeated these allegations during his speech Saturday. He also accused the countries of El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras of not doing enough to stop people from migrating to the U.S. -- which is why hedirected the State Department to cut off aito the three countries. Critics argue that cutting off aid would worsen the situation in these countries driving more people to seek asylum.""I've taken a lot of heat from the stupid people"" about the decision to cut off aid Mr. Trump said. ""What about building our own country for a change?""He also reiterated threats to close down the border which could be economically catastrophic for the country. ""I'll do whatever is necessary to stop an invasion of our country"" he said.Steven Portnoy contributed to this reporFirst published on April 6 2019 / 12:24 P© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

"A majority of Americans see the recentchanges to the tax lawas benefiting the wealthy and large corporations and most feel their own taxes have not gone down because of the law. Partisanship more than income drives views of how Americans view their tax situation.\u00aFour in 10 Americans say their taxes haven\u0027t been impacted by the tax law changes that went into effect in 2018. For those who do see a change more say it has made their taxes higher (32 percent) than lower (25 percent).Most Americans believe large corporations (65 percent) and wealthy people (61 percent) have been helped by the recent tax law changes. Far fewer think the middle class (31 percent) and homeowners (25 percent) have been helped. More Americans think those groups have been hurt rather than helped by the new law.\u00aThe public divides along partisan lines on how their own taxes have been affected by the law \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more so than by income level. Americans across income groups are more likely to say their taxes are now higher than lower. Those earning less \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with household incomes under $50000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are the most likely to say their taxes haven\u0027t been affected by the law.More Democrats say their taxes have gone up because of the tax law changes while more Republicans say theirs have gone down. Roughly four in 10 in each group say their taxes haven\u0027t changed.\u00aViews similarly cut along partisan lines when Americans are asked how they feel about their overall tax situation.

Partisanship more than income drives views of how Americans view their tax situation.Four in 10 Americans say their taxes haven't been impacted by the tax law changes that went into effect in 2018. For those who do see a change more say it has made their taxes higher (32 percent) than lower (25 percent).Most Americans believe large corporations (65 percent) and wealthy people (61 percent) have been helped by the recent tax law changes. Far fewer think the middle class (31 percent) and homeowners (25 percent) have been helped. More Americans think those groups have been hurt rather than helped by the new law.The public divides along partisan lines on how their own taxes have been affected by the law — more so than by income level. Americans across income groups are more likely to say their taxes are now higher than lower. Those earning less — with household incomes under $50000 — are the most likely to say their taxes haven't been affected by the law.Buttigieg challenges Pence on LGBTQ rights: ""Your quarrel is with my creator""Secret Service director other top DHS officials leaving amid overhauDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks for first time since resignation announcemenEric Swalwell joins 2020 race for presidenMore Democrats say their taxes have gone up because of the tax law changes while more Republicans say theirs have gone down.

The White House emphasized the action ""sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences.""Buttigieg challenges Pence on LGBTQ rights: ""Your quarrel is with my creator""Secret Service director other top DHS officials leaving amid overhauDHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks for first time since resignation announcemenEric Swalwell joins 2020 race for presiden""We will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior"" the president said.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally made the announcement to the media at the State Department Monday morning saying the move will ""deprive the world's leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death.""""The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization but none of us should be fooled"" Pompeo told reporters.As one senior administration official put it on a conference call with reporters ""Today the IRGC's era of plausible deniability is over.""Pompeo accused the IRGC of being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members. He said that ""the blood of the 603 American soldiers"" believed to have been killed by Iranian-sponsored groups during the Iraq War is on the hands of the IRGC.Asked about the timing of the announcement special representative to Iran Brian Hook said it's being done now because ""it's the next step"" in the administration's maximum pressure campaign. The goal according to the administration is to make Iran's economy ""radioactive"" so that businesses in Europe and around the world will come to the conclusion that dealing with Iran is simply not worth the risk.CBS News ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan reports that White House officials including National Security Adviser John Bolton and Pompeo himself had been arguing for the designation for some time. The Pentagon however had voiced concerns about the designation given the close proximity of U.S. troops in Syria to Iranian forces.Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have escalated since the Trump administration's pullout of the Iran nuclear agreement. The administration has since imposed theThe ideological militia has about 125000 members and permeates almost every aspect of Iranian society with influence in political military economic circles. It is also thought to manage some 20 percent of the Iranian economy. So with this designation the Trump administration is once again going after the money having previously sanctioned almost 1000 entities and individuals with ties to Iran.Critics of this designation and the America's hawkish policy toward Iran point out that every time the US takes action action Iran the Iranian government digs in. There are no off-ramps or face-saving measures  on the table that would allow Iran's leaders to save face if they chose to reverse course-- and no indication they plan to do so any time soon.The all-stick-and-no-carrot approach has no gone down well with Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif who called rumors of the terror designation ""another U.S. disaster."" He tweeted that the policy was being enacted a the behest of supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In a tweet following the official announcement Netanyahu thanked his ""dear friend"" President Trump for making the designation.תודה לך ידידי היקר נשיא ארה״ב דונלד טראמפ על כך שהחלטת להכריז על משמרות המהפכה של איראן כעל ארגון טרור. תודה על שנענית לעוד בקשה חשובה שלי שמשרתת את האינטרס של מדינותינו ושל מדינות האזור. נמשיך לפעול יחד בכל דרך נגד המשטר האיראני שמאיים על מדינת ישראל על ארה״ב ועל שלום העולם.In a translated message Netanyahu thanked the U.S. president ""for responding to another important request of mine which serves the interests of our countries and countries of the region."" The Israeli leader who is seeking a fifth term as prime minister in Tuesday's election has repeatedly denounced the Iranian regime as seeking to destroy the Jewish state encouraging Mr. Trump to stand with Israel in defiance of Iran's nuclear ambitions.""We will continue to act together in any way against the Iranian regime that threatens the state of Israel the United States and the Peace of the world"" Netanyahu said.Meanwhile Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has alluded that it would continue to build up its military power despite strict U.S. sanctions. Asked about the Iranian response Secretary Pompeo said Iran had better think ""more than twice"" before attacking the United States.CBS News' Christina Ruffini contributed to this report.This is a developing story.First published on April 8 2019 / 10:22 A© 2019 CBS Interactive Inc.

He issued a nationwide preliminary injunction that prevents the administration from forcing future asylum-seekers back into Mexico. The order goes into effect on Friday.Seeborg who was nominated by former President Barack Obama ruled that the Trump policy was not properly implemented and violated both U.S. laws and the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees which the U.S. is a party to. The asylum-seekers Seeborg ruled were already fleeing dangerous conditions in their home countries only to be returned to Mexican border towns ""where they face undue risk to their lives and freedom.""The ruling marks the third straight time the Trump administration has been shot down in its attempts to limit or halt asylum-seekers who have been arriving at the U.S. border in record numbers.""Try as it may the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States"" said Judy Rabinovitz deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case.another federal judge struck dowthe Department of Justice's attempt to cut off asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. In Novemberanother federal judge struck dowJustice's attempts to cut off asylum for people who crossed into the country illegally which is allowed under U.S. law.In that case U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar wrote that Trump ""may not rewrite the immigration laws.""Families hoping to seek asylum in the United States wait on the bridge connecting Reynosa Mexico to Hidalgo Texas on March 15 2019.Central American migrants who were among the first to be returned to Tijuana after requesting asylum at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California and several humanitarian groups that have been assisting migrants.The policy officially called thebut informally referred to as the ""Remain in Mexico"" plan started in January at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California. The policy has expanded to the Calexico Port of Entry about 120 miles east of San Ysidro and Homeland Security officials say the plan is to gradually roll it out to all other ports along the U.S.-Mexico border.It allows migrants from countries other than Mexico to request asylum at U.S ports of entry but then requires them to return to Mexico to wait for a decision. Previously asylum seekers were released into the U.S. and given a notice to appear in immigration court to proceed with their case.The U.S. and Mexican governments had been negotiating a joint plan where Mexico would assume responsibility of the waiting asylum applicants but when those talks broke down the Trump administrationit would unilaterally implement the policy forcing Mexico and collection of humanitarian groups to care for those migrants in Mexico.President Donald Trump tours border walA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.President Donald Trump speaks with members of the US Customs and Border Patrol as he tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico Calif. on April 5 2019.

More than 2500 families were separated under the policy.It was Nielsen though who became most closely associated with the policy.In press briefings and congressional hearings Nielsen vigorously defended the administration and argued it was simply enforcing U.S. law. She took issue with descriptions of the policy as “family separation” and said it simply mandated the criminal prosecution against all migrants including those crossing the border with children. That forced families to be separated because children can't be housed in adult detention centers.In one of her more memorable claims Nielsen disputed that children separated from their families were being held in cages even though photos and video showed young children in chain-link structures at Customers and Border Protection facilities.To her critics her defense of the policy indefensible.“The irreparable harm she has caused in implementing brutal anti-immigrant policies cannot be measured and has left a dark stain on our country’s history” said Christina Fialho co-founder and executive director ofOthers came to her defense.“I have thought that over the last several months that she’s done a number of things better than I expected her to do” said Roy Beck president ofwhich advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration. “She’s like most people in that if you’re in a job and there’s a little bit of on-the-job training it’s just very very difficult to take the bold moves that you need to do and do them well that are called for a crisis situation. She was in a very tough position.”After resigning Kirstjen Nielsen says she supports Trump's goal of 'securing the border'Nielsen also continued a policy that began under Trump of phasing out the(TPS) program which has allowed more than 315000 foreigners to legally live and work in the U.S. as their home countries recover from civil wars and natural disasters.Arguing that the programs were wrongly extended by previous administrations Nielsen cut them off one by one ordering foreigners who have lived in the U.S. for decades to return home.In doing so she ignored pleas from Democrats Republicans immigrant rights activists and even the administration’s State Department which argued that the home countries were not yet ready to accept tens of thousands of its residents.A federal judge has blocked Homeland Security from deporting those families who are mostly from Central America.In December Nielsen announced a new policy banning asylum seekers from entering the U.S. and requiring them to stay in Mexico a change that upended the way migrants fleeing persecution have been welcomed into the country for decades.Under U.S. law people requesting asylum at the southern border – either at a port of entry or after illegally entering the country and who pass an initial screening – had been allowed to stay in the country pending an immigration judge’s decision on their application.Under the new policy which the administration callsthat is no longer the case. Anybody who requests asylum is processed by federal immigration agents then immediately returned to Mexico.A coalition of immigration groups is seeking a court order to block the administration from enforcing the policy. On Monday a federal judge in California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the policy barring the administration from sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico.DHS secretary: We face a humanitarian and security crisiNielsen was present at the January 2018 meeting in which a frustrated Trump reportedly used a crude term to describe Haiti El Salvador and African countries.“Why are we having all these people fromcome here?"" Trump reportedly said during the meeting which was attended by a small group of lawmakers.When asked about Trump’s comments during a Senate hearing Nielsen said she did not hear Trump use “that word.”Under questioning Nielsen described the meeting as “impassioned” and acknowledged that Trump and others in the room had used “tough language.”Despite her public defense of Trump Nielsen’s toughest critics included Trump himself.The president berated Nielsen in front of others durinblaming her for a surge in illegal border crossings and arguing she had not done enough to stop them.Trump griped that Nielsen wasn’t tough enough and often complained about her job performance as his administration made little headway in delivering on his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.The confrontations led to speculation that Nielsen planned to resign but she stayed on the job nearly a year before finally submitting her resignation on Sunday.Even eating out became a challenge for Nielsen amid the backlash over Trump’s immigration policies.Last June a group of protesters angry over Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy barged into thean upscale Mexican restaurant near the White House and interrupted Nielsen’s dinner.""How can you enjoy a Mexican dinner as you're deporting and imprisoning tens of thousands of people who come here seeking asylum in the United States?"" protester Jesse Rabinowitz a member of the D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America shouted inappearing to show the incident.""We call on you to end family separation and abolish (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)” Rabinowitz said.Other protesters chanted and made speeches as Nielsen and another diner sat nearby. Another video appeared to show Nielsen her leaving the restaurant.Contributing: John Fritze Ryan MilleWhite House ousts Secret Service chief Randolph Alles part of broad Homeland Security shakeuA look at Kirstjen Nielsen Trump's Homeland Security SecretarA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testifies before the Homeland Security Committee hearing on ""The Way Forward on Border Security"" in Washington on March 6 2019.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testifies before the Homeland Security Committee hearing on ""The Way Forward on Border Security"" in Washington on March 6 2019.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks with President Trump as they meet to discuss fighting human trafficking on the southern border Washington on Feb. 1 2019.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks at George Washington University's Jack Morton Auditorium in Washington on March 18 2019.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tours the U.S.-Mexico border fence in San Diego on Nov. 20 2018.NICK OZA The Arizona Republic via USA TODAY NetworHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testifies before the Homeland Security Committee hearing on ""The Way Forward on Border Security"" in Washington on March 6 2019.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen center administers the oath of citizenship to five people as President  Trump left and Vice President Pence right look on during a naturalization ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on Jan. 19 2019.RON SACHS  Pool photPresident Trump talks to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen during a meeting to discuss human trafficking on the southern border in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington on Feb. 1 2019.Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen with Vice President Pence (L) and  House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy right responds to a question from the news media after a meeting with President Trump at the White House in Washington on Jan. 9 2019.Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen speaks beside Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross left and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker right during a news conference held to announce law enforcement action related to Huawei Technologies Co.

Trump booted former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in November.Those higher profile departures and vacancies do not include lower-level officials that are often conducting tangible work on critical issues.When the administration wrestled with the recent crashes of two Boeing 737 Max airplanes overseas the Federal Aviation Administration was led by a former Air Force lieutenant general who had been serving as an “acting” administrator for more than a year.Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb resigned last month. Former FEMA Administrator Brock Long stepped down in February. Trump has named a replacement for FEMA Jeffrey Byard but not the FDA.Trump announced on Monday that the director of the U.S. Secret Service Randolph ""Tex"" Alles would be “leaving shortly.” Trump’s chief of staff former congressman Mick Mulvaney has been serving in an “acting” capacity since December.Trump has explained the number of positions in his administration filled with temporary appointments by saying it gives him more discretion to make changes.'I sort of like Acting'“I sort of like Acting. It gives me more flexibility” Trump told reporters in January.Nielsen’s departure which just came days after Trump yanked the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement follows an effort by the White House to take a “stronger direction” on immigration issues.The president has declared a national emergency to speed up construction of his border wall and has recently threatened to “close the border with Mexico” unless that country stems the flow of migrants arriving from Central America.The scramble to replace Nielsen has underscored another challenge for Trump: Turnover has hit the lower ranks at federal departments just as hard as it has its leaders. The Department of Homeland Security doesn’t have a permanent deputy secretary in place to take over for Nielsen. That job is being filled on an acting basis Claire Grady who is also the department’s undersecretary for management.Trump named Kevin McAleenan the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection but experts say the White House will have to fire Grady – who is next in line for the job – to put McAleenan in place temporarily.Turnover below the Cabinet secretary level is particularly damaging for an administration wrestling to make major policy changes throughout the government experts said.“For an administration that wants to make change you've got to have people in place” said Chase Untermeyer who was director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel under President George H.

She said he would be replaced by Assistant Director James Murray.The White House offered no explanation for the director's removal.Alles who disputed that he was fired is expected to leave his post next month.“No doubt you have seen media reports regarding my 'firing'"" the director said in an internal message to staffers. ""I assure you that this is not the case and in fact was told weeks ago by the administration that transitions in leadership should be expected across the Department of Homeland Security. The president has directed an orderly transition in leadership for this agency and I intend to abide by that direction. It is my sincere regret that I was not able to address the workforce prior to this announcement.""Alles took office less than two years ago as the service emerged from a series of White House security breaches and incidents of agent misconduct. A senior official who is not authorized to comment publicly confirmed that the director was informed two weeks ago that the White House was making the change. The person said his ouster was part of a broader leadership shakeup throughout Homeland Security.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned Sunday night. President Donald Trump rescinded his nomination of Ron Vitiello to head U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying he wanted to go in a ""tougher"" direction.Nielsen and Alles were part of a leadership team assembled by White House chief of staff John Kelly who previously ran the Homeland Security Department. Kelly a retired Marine Corps general had close ties with Nielsen. Alles himself a former Marine major general served as the acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under Kelly.The official said Alles' removal was not related to last week's arrest of a Chinese national who penetrated security checkpoints at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida carrying a cache of electronics that included a malware-infected thumb drive.That incident prompted the FBI to beginreviewing whether the president's resort could be vulnerablto foreign spying. A government official familiar with the inquiry said it was opened out of ""an abundance of caution"" as it was unclear what threat if any the woman Yujing Zhang represented.A Secret Service agent on the White House lawn.Asked last week whether he was concerned about the security breach Trump betrayed no indication that he was mulling a change at the Secret Service lavishing only praise on the agency.""Secret Service is fantastic"" Trump said Wednesday. ""These are fantastic people. ... I would say I could not be happier with Secret Service. Secret Service has done a fantastic job from day one. Very happy with them.""During his brief tenure overseeing a staff of 6500 and a $1.6 billion budget Alles won legislative approval to compensate more than 1000 agents for hundreds of hours in unpaid overtime as they sought to protect Trump's large family.Alles pushed for the additional compensation after USA TODAY first reported thatthe agency could not pay hundreds of agentwho had reached federally mandated caps on salary and overtime allowances as the agency grappled with protecting a president and his extended family who travel frequently.Exclusive: Secret Service depletes funds to pay agents because of Trump's frequent travel large familUnder Trump the service protected an unprecedented 42 officials up from 31 during the Obama administration. The number included 18 Trump family members.Alles acknowledged the president's large family in an interview with USA TODAY but said there was ""no flexibility"" in the service's mandated protective responsibility.""I can't change that"" he said.Before he was named to replace Alles Murray was responsible for the planning and coordination of the agency's protective mission. In that role Murray presided over presidential and foreign dignitary protection; special national security events including the annual State of the Union address; and the protection of critical national facilities.Murray joined the service in 1995 as a special agent in the New York field office where he conducted cyber-related financial crime investigations and served and worked on a terrorism task force. In 2001 Murray was appointed to the Presidential Protective Division and promoted as the deputy special agent in charge of presidential protection.In Alles' message to staffers he described Murray as a ""true leader"" and urged the agency to support his appointment.""It has been my great honor to serve as director of the U.S. Secret Service"" Alles said.President Donald Trump says the Secret Service has done a great job since day one.Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/white-house-removes-secret-service-director-continuing-homeland-security-upheaval/3402033002/",1

Bernie Sanders I-Vt. speaks during the We the People Membership Summit featuring the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates at the Warner Theater in Washington Monday April 1 2019.That puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns which he has not yet released. He initially blamed ""mechanical issues"" for the delay and his campaign now says he wants to wait until after the April 15 tax filing deadline to fulfill his promise to release a decade worth of returns.Sanders has largely embraced his new front-runner status. More than any other candidate he draws explicit comparisons with President Donald Trump in his campaign remarks previewing his approach to a general election faceoff with the incumbent Republican. Behind the scenes Sanders is also building out a larger more diverse campaign operation responding to criticism that his 2016 organization skewed too heavily white and male. Campaign officials say the 2020 campaign staff — roughly 100 people and growing — is majority female and 40% people of color.Ohio Sen. Nina Turner fires up the crowd prior to the arrival of U.S. Sen.

His advisers argue the populist economic message Sanders has espoused for years often in obscurity has now been embraced not only by a slew of his Democratic rivals but also Trump.""Donald Trump campaigned on economic terms as faux Bernie Sanders. It was taking his language and selling it to the American people"" said Faiz Shakir Sanders' campaign manager. ""And now how do you defeat faux Bernie Sanders? You defeat him with real Bernie Sanders.""Bernie Sanders hits back at Trump's 'socialist' tauntSanders owes some of his fast start to the fact thathe never really stopped running for presidenafter the 2016 campaign.

""Even though many of them did not win it was appreciated it was movement building and it was a different calculation than most politicians make.""Despite his strong launch Sanders' current standing atop the Democratic field is not entirely enviable. Presidential primaries are long and turbulent and past elections underscore how many early front-runners have been tossed aside before the first votes are cast. Former Vice President Joe Biden has signaled his expected presidential campaign would serve as a centrist check on Sanders' brand of progressive politics.Sanders' $18 million first-quarter fundraising haufar outpaced the rest of the Democratic field some rival campaigns breathed a sigh of relief having anticipated the Vermont senator would clear $20 million or more.""He did very well.

""We are going to continue to court and address these issues directly but we are operating with a great deal of confidence that this is going to be a particular demographic that supports Bernie Sanders at the end of the day.""Women of color are a key 2020 voting bloc. More Dems are trying to woo them at this foruPerhaps Sanders' biggest challenge is overcoming skepticism among voters who may be partial to his focus on economic inequality but fear that nominating a 77-year-oldwould put Democrats in a weak position against Trump in the general election.""That's a thing that scares me about him"" said Gwen Hobson a 70-year-old Democratic voter who attended Sanders' rally on Friday in Davenport.Yet some of Sanders' longtime supporters say their enthusiasm for him is unshakable.

They've been more likely to side with the court's liberal justices than its other conservatives.The two justices both alumni of the same District of Columbia-based federal appeals court have split publicly only once in 25 official decisions. Their partnership has extended though less reliably to orders the court has issued on abortion funding immigration and the death penalty in the six months since Kavanaugh'sended in a 50-48 vote.Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inboRoberts and Kavanaugh have obvious reasons for their reluctance to join the court's three other conservatives in ideological harmony.

Roberts 64 is earnest and soft-spoken but pointed in his questions to both sides during oral arguments. Kavanaugh 54 is more demonstrative but he tempers that with an inquisitive open-minded manner.Who is the real Brett Kavanaugh? Legal whiz kid or partisan hack? Mentor to women or beer-loving frat boy?Whatever their reasons the chief justice and the newest justice together have provided ballast for a court in transition. Following Kavanaugh's replacement of retired Associate Justice Anthony KennedyRoberts has become the court's swing vot and Kavanaugh often appears to be his wingman.Examples include the court's action last October giving those challenging ain the 2020 census access to additional information about the plan; its refusal in December to consider Republican-led states'efforts to defund Planned Parenthoo; and its ruling in February that Texas cannot execute a prisoner who claims to have anIn all three of those actions Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented; Associate Justice Samuel Alito made known his opposition in two of them. Roberts and Kavanaugh appear to have voted with the court's liberals though the breakdown was not made public.Their differences have been rare but noteworthy. In addition to one public vote in a criminal procedure case Roberts sided with the liberals in temporarily blocking while Kavanaugh would have let them go into effect.And while they refused to hear a New Jersey county's effort to include churches in a historic preservation program and a Washington state high school coach's plea to conduct prayers on the football field Kavanaugh warned of the need to protect religious liberty.Supreme Court’s new conservative majoritA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.The formal 2018 portrait of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Pelosi is quick to point out she has never lost a major vote on the House floor. She hasDemocratic support this year on most major House legislation – although the measures are largely messaging vehicles because theof passing the GOP-controlled Senate.hammered on the campaign trailast year for being a San Francisco liberal but in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY she embraced the label as a way of showing her party’s left wing she is one of them before asking them to move toward the center.“I’m a progressive from San Francisco. I think I can have some credentials on the left as a person who has represented a very liberal city” Pelosi said last month in Ferguson.“But you have to govern mainstream” she added.USA TODAY spent the day traveling with Pelosi in St. Louis and Ferguson as she joined Rep. Lacy Clay D-Mo. to promote policies that unite Democrats: expanding voting rights job growth and cleaning up corruption in government. Even though the trip followed weeks of Democratic infighting and botched messaging in Missouri none of those issues came up.Pelosi is leading her most diverse caucus yet.Some liberals such as freshmen Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. proudly embrace socialism want sweeping action on climate change and call for a government-run health care system. Ocasio-Cortez a social media star said Democrats compromise too much and has called out party lawmakers who vote with Republicans.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi with Cathy Jenkins the owner of Cathy's Kitchen in Ferguson Mo. Rep. Lacy Clay who represents Ferguson is in the background March 18 2019.(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Fear of the socialist labelDemocrats in competitive districts run as far as they can from the socialist label. They want to focus on what they campaigned on: lowering health care costs bolstering infrastructure and spurring jobs growth. They are willing to work with Republicans. Rep. Josh Gottheimer D-N.J. who co-chairs the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus said that in divided government “the key is actually moving the ball forward which requires us working with both sides.”Pelosi is trying to bridge those viewpoints. In a nod to each wing of the party she said Democrats should fight for the “boldest common denominator.”“While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers what’s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House” Pelosi said. Ocasio-Cortez hasWhen USA TODAY asked how more liberal members responded when she told them they needed legislation that could pass she responded “They’re fine.""“As I say to my own district ‘You go out and elect 218 people just like San Francisco then we can talk' "" she said.Democrats captured the House majority in November 2018 by winning seats in districts starkly different from deep-blue San Francisco. Voters there backed Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly against Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential elections. In her reelection bid in 2018 Pelosi captured 87% of the vote. But more than two dozen Democratic House members represent districts that Trump won in 2016 some by double digits including Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson whose district the president carried by 31%.Pelosi 79 is holding the speaker’s gavel for the second time. She’s the highest-ranking woman elected in politics. Her colleagues say being a mother of five and a grandmother of nine shows in how she interacts with people. She can be both “loving” and “tough as nails” according to Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos who leads Democrats’ campaign arm for the 2020 reelection. Bustos has experienced both sides as a member of leadership who is from a Trump district.During every encounter in Missouri Pelosi tried to forge a personal connection with constituents and activists. She held the hand of an employee giving a tour of a children’s health center. She elicited laughs during a town hall including former prisoners when she teased their teacher himself a former inmate after he compared himself to Denzel Washington. She lingered long after the handshake in conversations with the former prisoners.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi speaking to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis March 18 2019.(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Other stories you may like:Congressional Democrats question AG William Barr's decision that Trump didn't obstruct justicDemocrats' strategy on Mueller report: Steer clear of impeachment talk about health carShe has long had a reputation for toughness. In December she won plaudits from her party for confronting Trump in the Oval Office over his demand for a wall along the southern border.But personal relationships are the key for Pelosi in trying to hold together a caucus that is even more ideologically divided than it was during her tenure as speaker from 2007 to 2011.Is the shifting Democratic Party ""a problem for her that she needs to manage? Yeah it probably is"" said Paul Becka political science professor emerituBeck said it's crucial that Pelosi doesn’t leave “some of these moderate Democrats many of whom were replacing Republicans kind of out to dry and very vulnerable to Republican attacks in the 2020 election.""Republicans’ strategy for targeting vulnerable congressional Democrats centers on linking them to the agenda of far-left liberals such as Ocasio-Cortez.Many freshmen Democrats who flipped GOP seats in November ran far away from liberal priorities such as ""Medicare for All"" a national program that would guarantee health insurance for every American. Dozens vowed to oppose Pelosi for speaker after Republicans held her up as a symbol of liberal policies. Pelosi didn’t take it personally. “Just win baby"" she said in May 2018.Pelosi told USA TODAY she has been able to keep her caucus together because she understands her members and their districts. Observers in both parties said she knows exactly what members want. That knowledge has allowed her to flatter threaten and just simply wear them down until she has the support needed.In March as Democrats awaited the results of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election some in the party talked of impeaching Trump. Pelosi urged cautionthat impeachment would be a “gift” to the president if Republicans weren’t on board. She dismissed demands for a stronger stance on impeachment: “They wanted to impeach the president since the day he got elected.”After Mueller’s investigation wrapped up with a finding that there was no collusion with Russia most Democrats have followed Pelosi and put impeachment talk aside.Pelosi ""is the most gifted strategic person I’ve ever met when it comes to politics. If you’re in her crosshairs she’s your most formidable opponent and if she’s on your side and with you she’s able to do magical things” said Joe Crowley the former Democratic Caucus chairman who lost his seat in New York last year in a primary upset by Ocasio-Cortez.When you walk into Pelosi’s office you’ll find two products from her San Francisco district: bowls of Ghirardelli chocolate (dark her favorite) and a stack of San Francisco Giants baseball bats. The bats lean against a dark brown cabinet where four TVs play C-Span feeds of the House and Senate floors along with MSNBC and CNN.Former New York Rep. Steve Israel a Democrat who has worked closely with Pelosi likens the chocolate and bats to her leadership style.“We can do this the sweet way or we can do this the hard way. But we’re going to do this” said Israel who led the House Democrats’ campaign arm in 2012 and 2014.When Pelosi arrived at the first stop in the St. Louis area a tour of a children’s health center Rep. Clay gave her some local dark mint chocolates.“I like to do it the sweet way” Clay said laughing. “She will pressure you if you don’t agree with the direction that she wants to take our caucus.“She can be very persistent and insistent. She just keeps hammering on her point” he said.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi arrives to take a tour of the Lacy Clay Center for Children’s Health in St. Louis Mo. March 18 2019 along with Congressman William Lacy Clay D-Mo. right. Pelosi is holding a gift from Clay which includes dark mint chocolates.-(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Pelosi laughed off Israel’s chocolate and bats metaphor. “I’m a sports fan” she said.There are examples of the tactic as recently as the end of last year. Dozens of candidates and incumbents said they would not support her for speaker. But shein January with only 15 defections.In late 2018 Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio briefly considered challenging Pelosi for speaker but opted against it. She was given the chairmanship of a new subcommittee. By contrast Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York a longtime Pelosi critic pushed for new leadership and refused to vote for Pelosi. Later when the former prosecutor lobbied to join the Judiciary Committee she was blocked by Pelosi and her allies according to two sources familiar with the incident.Mirror of the tea party?Some Republicans acknowledged Pelosi's success in holding her caucus together.But based on their own experience they aren’t sure how long it will last. They suggested cracks are emerging that remind them of the tea party’s rise on their side – and the headaches the faction posed for former Republican Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. ( in part over frustration dealing with the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. Wisconsin’s Ryadid not run for reelectio“It’s similar to what we as Republicans dealt with when we were in the majority. You have an ascendant left that is very angry very blunt frankly a little irresponsible in the things they say. And the base soaks it up” said former Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello a GOP moderate who retired last year. A Democrat holds his former seat.“I think it’s kind of like Groundhog Day but now it’s a different color. It’s a blue groundhog” Costello said.Some grassroots liberals demand that Pelosi put proposals such as the Green New Deal aimed at climate change and Medicare for All up for a vote even if they stand no chance of passing the GOP-led Senate and being signed into law by Trump.Alexandra Rojas executive director of Justice Democrats a group that helped launch Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional bid called on Pelosi and other Democratic leaders to “embrace the grassroots energy that’s in the Democratic base right now” – or give up the post to someone who will.Pelosi said there were no plans to bring up the Green New Deal because it wasInstead she pointed out that she created a select committee to address climate change and she said other panels would work on the issue as well. House Democrats introduced a more modest bill that would put the United States back intothe Paris Climate Agreement after President Trump withdrew.The Rules and Budget Committee will hold hearings on Medicare for All but Pelosi has made no commitment to bring it to the floor for a vote.“While I’m very supportive of shoring up the Affordable Care Act right away I simply don’t think that we get to our final conclusion without a Medicare for All bill” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal D-Wash. who co-chairs the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Jayapal said she supports rejoining the Paris climate accord but there was much more to be done to address an “urgent crisis.”Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi listens to Fathers Support Center of St. Louis CEO Halbert Sullivan who founded Fathers’ Support Center in St. Louis March 18 2019.(Photo: Jack Gruber USA TODAY)Jayapal said she wants to persuade members that more liberal policies can be popular in their districts but “I don’t believe in shaming for the most part.” She said polling by the Progressive Caucus shows many voters in districts that Trump won are receptive to Medicare for All and other left-leaning policies.Rep. Stephanie Murphy D-Fla. a co-chair of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition expressed skepticism and said using “talking points” to sell a liberal agenda was not the answer to winning seats in moderate districts.“I got an econ degree and one of the truisms is that you can find data to support any theory you want. It depends how you ask the question” Murphy said.“Our members got elected in really tough seats red to blue seats seats that Trump won because they understood their constituents” she said. “Let’s give them the respect they deserve to represent their communities the best way they know best how.”The Florida Democrat said moderates are concerned about health care and climate too but they want to make sure the legislation has a chance of making it through the GOP Senate and onto the president’s desk.“I think we can address these issues looking at the problem in smaller pieces” Murphy said.In Missouri the day went smoothly. Back in Washington Pelosi and Democratic leadership have not been so lucky. Internal divisions have grabbed headlines even though House Democrats easily passed their signature priorities.Green New Deal dies in Senate and Democrats helped kill iDonald Trump takes victory lap over Mueller result. Will it help him in 2020?When Democrats cleared the first major piece of legislation in25 years on background checks for firearm 26 moderates voted with Republicans to amend the bill to require turning over undocumented immigrants to the government if they try to buy a gun. Pelosi and liberals scolded those who crossed party lines behind closed doors. Ocasio-Cortez told membersshe had alerted left-wing activistthat 26 Democrats were responsible for the amendments’ passage according to two aides in the room.When asked about the incident Pelosi said the GOP amendments formally known as “motions to recommit” and designed to put members of the majority in uncomfortable positions were simply “procedural” and “not anything that is worthy of our conversation.”More than a week later all Democratsvoted to pass House Resolution a bill focused onvoting rights and congressional ethic. In the days before the vote the party’s message on the legislation was overshadowed by a controversy over comments made by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar who said Israel demands ""allegiance"" from U.S. lawmakers. Republicans and some Democrats said the remarks played to anti-Semitic tropes by questioning the loyalty of American Jews.Jewish members wanted the House to immediately vote on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism. Several liberal members pushed for a broader resolution condemning all forms of hate and said it was unfair to single out Omar. It took days before Democrats finally passed a broad anti-hate resolution. Omar’s name was not included. Some Jewish members were disappointed at what they felt was a watered-down measure. Other Democrats were frustrated the debate had dragged on so long.“I wished she would have moved quickly” said Jim Manley a Democratic strategist and former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. But Manley said he understood why it took so long: “Such a diverse caucus you’ve got to take everybody’s opinions into account.”Pelosi said she thought the resolution turned out as it should have and listening to all members was a positive despite the time it takes.“I think we came out very strong” she said.Contributing: William Cummings and Christal HayeEyes on the prize: In poll Democrats care more about victory than ideology in 2020 nomineExclusive: Nancy Pelosi vows 'different world' for Trump no more 'rubber stamp' in new CongresPelosi spends the day in Missouri charming her supporterA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis she was in Missouri as part of her seven-city tour across the country focused on promoting the Democratic agendNancy Pelosi during a tour of the Lacy Clay Center for Children’s Health in St. Louis.Nancy Pelosi speaks to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. LouiNancy Pelosi speaking to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis along with Congressman William Lacy Clay (D-Missouri) center and Fathers Support Center of St. Louis CEO Halbert Sullivan who founded Fathers’ Support Center in 1997 with a mission to provide noninvolved fathers the support they need to get back into the lives of their children as positive productive parents.Nancy Pelosi at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis along with Congressman William Lacy Clay (D-Missouri).Nancy Pelosi at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis.Nancy Pelosi speaking to people at the Fathers Support Center of St. Louis with Fathers Support Center CEO Halbert Sullivan.

It estimated the process ""would take at least 12 months and possibly up to 24 months.""Last month U.S. District Judge Dana Sabrawexpanded the number of migrant familiethat the government may be forced to reunite under his previous order after an inspector general report revealed that the administration had an undisclosed family separation pilot program in place starting in July of 2017. The ruling was made as part of a lawsuit led by the American Civil Liberties Union.President Donald Trump participates in a roundtable on immigration and border security at the U.S. Border Patrol Calexico Station in Calexico California on April 5 2019.Trump administration may have to reunite thousands of additional migrant familie""The administration refuses to treat the family separation crisis it created with urgency "" the ACLU said in a statement Saturday. ""We strongly oppose any plan that gives the government up to two years to find kids. The government swiftly gathered resources to tear families apart. It must do the same to fix the damage.""The administration refuses to treat the family separation crisis it created with urgency. We strongly oppose any plan that gives the government up to two years to find kids.The government swiftly gathered resources to tear families apart. It must do the same to fix the damage.In recent months the number of families crossing into the U.S. has climbed to record highs putting severe strains on an already overburdened immigration system. In the past most of those seeking to illegally cross the border were single mostly male Mexican nationals coming in search of work.More than half are now parents and children fleeing impoverished Central American countries where violent crime is rampant.""The numbers are overwhelming right now"" Gregory Archambault the director of enforcement and removal operations in San Diego for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told The Associated Press. ""Everybody is stressed because there are these mass numbers of people.""""More and more people now accepting the fact that it's a real crisis"" acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday during an interview with Fox News.Mulvaney said the issues of migrant families and unaccompanied migrant children required congressional action because ""there's legally nothing that the (Department of Homeland Security) can do with the children.""Rep. Ben Ray Luján D-N.M. said Democrats want to work with the president on a solution.""Separating children from their families at the border is not humane. It's not what the United States should be doing and we continue to see this administration engage in those policies"" Luján said on ""Fox News Sunday.""Friday's court filing came the same day President Donald Trump declared that there is ""indeed an emergency on our southern border"" during a tour of the border in Calexico California. He cited an upturn in the number of migrants arriving at the border in recent months.""It’s a colossal surge and it’s overwhelming our immigration system and we can’t let that happen"" Trump said.""We can’t take you anymore. We can’t take you. Our country is full"" he warned those who might attempt to come to the U.S.Like Trump Mulvaney applauded Mexico for its apprehension of migrants in recent days which he claimed was sparked by Trump's threats to close the border or impose tariffs on Mexico's auto exports if the country did not do more to stem the flow of northbound migrants.But despite the White House's claims that Mexico was apprehending migrants for the ""first time in decades"" Mexico has takenhundreds of thousands of migrants into custodin the past four years from the ""Northern Triangle"" countries of Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras. Mexico said its numbers in recent months were ""about average.""""There is no very substantive change"" Mexico’s foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said this week. ""There has not been a drastic change.""Trump is wrong on Mexico's migrant apprehensionLuján said Trump ""continues to use immigration as a distraction."" He questioned whether the Department of Homeland Security was ""accurately describing"" its apprehension statistics because he said many families were voluntarily turning themselves in to seek asylum status.""This is not the national security crisis that the president continues to describe"" Luján said. ""There is a humanitarian crisis but it's created by President Donald Trump.""Some immigration experts agree with Luján's assessment. They say Trump’s policies have caused so much chaos along the border that they may be encouraging illegal crossings.For example the family separation controversy helped to highlight the fact that families won’t be detained for long in the U.S. if they’re detained at all.And metering in which people are asked to return to a busy port of entry on another day to seek asylum may have encouraged asylum-seekers to cross illegally said Andrew Selee president of the Migration Policy Institute a nonpartisan think tank.""This policy chaos coupled with a sense that the U.S. government may at some point really shut down the border has generated an urgency to migrate now while it is still possible"" Selee said.Fourth person in six months dies in ICE immigration detention centeGomez USA TODAY; The Associated PresPresident Donald Trump tours border walA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.President Donald Trump speaks with members of the US Customs and Border Patrol as he tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico Calif. on April 5 2019.

He has repeatedly cited an ongoing audit of his finances.Neal is one of only three congressional officials authorized under a rarely used 1924 law to make a written request to the treasury secretary for anyone’s tax returns. The law says the treasury secretary “shall furnish” the requested material to members of the committee for them to examine behind closed doors.Consovoy argued that while Neal is allowed under law to request tax returns his request is required to revolve around a specific legislative purpose.He argues that it's clear Democrats are requesting this information to embarrass Trump and score political points. Consovoy says if this request was solely to investigate the IRS' handling of presidential tax returns why did the committee ask for returns before Trump was president.He said Neal's request sought to conceal his party's true motive: ""Unconstitutional retaliation against the president.""Consovoy continues arguing the release of such information would set a ""dangerous precedent""""It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack harass and intimidate their political opponents"" Once this Pandora's box is opened the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.""Trump's lawyer asked the Treasury to delay any release until ""it receives a formal legal opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel."" Consovoy added: ""Caution and deliberation are essential to ensure that the Treasury Department does not erode the constitutional separation of powers.""Last month Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin suggested he would protect Trump’s privacy if he received a request from House Democrats for Trump’s tax returns.“We will examine the request and we will follow the law … and we will protect the president as we would protect any taxpayer” regarding their right to privacy Mnuchin said.Contributing: David Jackson and Eliza CollinRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/05/trumps-lawyer-blasts-tax-return-request-seeks-delay-treasury/3380015002/",1

All three judges were nominated by President Barack Obama.Hazel wrote that Ross repeatedly ignored the advice of researchers and career staff at the Census Bureau who concluded that citizenship data could best be obtained through other means.""The Census Bureau repeatedly consistently and unanimously recommended against adding a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census"" Hazel said.To justify his decision Ross pressured the Department of Justice for months to make a formal request for the citizenship question which Hazel described as a ""manufactured"" reason. The judge said Ross then ""failed to disclose the true basis for his decision"" in public pronouncements and testimony before Congress.Hazel also declared the administration's action unconstitutional because it would ""unreasonably"" compromise the accuracy of the census which is used to apportion congressional districts and distribute more than $900 billion in federal funds. An undercount of immigrant-heavy communities could cause states such as California New York Texas and Florida to lose representation and federal grant money.""Overwhelming evidence supports the Court’s finding that a citizenship question will cause a differential decline in Census participation among non-citizen and Hispanic households"" Hazel wrote.But Hazel said challengers did not prove that the question was racially motivated which they had alleged was a civil rights violation.the citizenship question would be added to the decennial census for the first time since 1950.A third federal judge ruled Friday against the Trump administration's plan to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. The Supreme Court takes up the issue later this month.(Photo: Michelle R. Smith AP) including the American Civil Liberties Union and the states of California and New York argued that adding the question was an attempt to intimidate non-citizens from participating in the census. That would lead to population undercounts in minority communities costing them seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and billions of dollars in federal funding they charged.Judge Jess Furman in New Yorblocked the addition of the question calling the secretary's contention that he made his decision based solely on a request from the Justice Department a ""sham justification."" In a 277-page ruling Furman ruled that Ross made his decision for other reasons then tried to conceal his motives.Judge Richard Seeborg in Californiastruck down the same question ruling that its inclusion in the 2020 census would lead to such drastic population undercounts that it ""threatens the very foundation of our democratic system.""After the New York ruling theSupreme Court agreed to hear the caseduring its April calendar. A decision is expected by the end of June in time for the Census Bureau to begin printing the document.Hazel's ruling emboldened challengers who have been preparing for the high court showdown.""The federal courts are unanimous that when you look at the actual evidence in front of Secretary Ross it indicates that this question is worse for the census"" said Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union who will argue the case later this month. ""There's no way that anyone can look at this record and rationally conclude that this question actually advanced the goal of having more accurate information about citizenship.""Fastest growing and shrinking stateA link has been posted to your Facebook feed.No. 1 for growth: The population of Utah grew by 2.0% in 2016 nearly three times the 0.7% national population growth rate and the fastest pace of any state.

Carlineo 55 of Addison was arrested Friday morning and charged by criminal complaint with threatening to assault and murder Omar a Democrat representing Minnesota.On March 21 a staff member in Omar's office received a phone call around 12:20 p.m. the criminal complaint states. During the call an individual eventually identified as Carlineo allegedly said to the staff member ""Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her she's an (expletive) terrorist. I’ll put a bullet in her (expletive) skull.""Fox News condemns host Jeanine Pirro's comments about Rep. Omar's hijaAfter receiving the call Omar's office referred the threat to the United States Capitol Police which began an investigation in coordination with the FBI.Omar is a freshman representative who was elected to the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm election and one of three members of Congress who are Muslim. Her freshman class was marked by its diversity bringing more people of color and women to Congress than ever before.Only three months in office Omar sparked controversy over her criticism of Israel's treatment of Palestinians and Israel lobbying efforts.She posted a series of tweets in February implying the influence of pro-Israel lobbying groups was stifling debate about Israel and Palestine. Critics said the comments played into enduring stereotypes about Jewish money controlling politics.In the aftermath of the controversy the House passed a resolution that broadly condemned hate. It was originally crafted solely on denouncing anti-Semitism but later broadened to condemning other forms of bigotry against minorities.House overwhelmingly passes resolution condemning hate after Rep. Ilhan Omar's commentCarlineo provided a name and phone number to Omar's staff member and authorities were able to trace the phone number to an Addison address.He was questioned March 29 by FBI agents at his residence in Steuben County according to the criminal complaint.Carlineo told the agents he is a patriot that he loves President Donald Trump and hates radical Muslims in government the complaint stated.""If our forefathers were still alive they'd put a bullet in her head"" he told the agents according to federal court documents.Carlineo also told agents he didn't remember exactly what he said to Omar's staffer but admitted it might have been close to what her office reported to authorities.He said that ""Omar supported Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and that her election to Congress was illegitimate"" according to the criminal complaint.When asked if there were any weapons in the residence Carlineo confirmed there was a shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle according to the complaint.You can critique Israel without sounding anti-Semitic.

You’ve got to sort of smile a little bit.""After Biden's speech Trump tweeted that he has the support of members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.""I’ve employed thousands of Electrical Workers"" Trump said. ""They will be voting for me!""But Kraig Lee a 49-year-old Republican from Vicksburg Michigan who attended the speech said Trump's “pockets of support are shrinking"" in his state.""Hate can only carry you so far and he’s very divisive"" Lee said.Biden was more than halfway through his 40-minute speech before he mentioned Trump directly. He said Trump opposes the core values and beliefs of the nation in the way he treats people.“What in the hell is happening?"" Biden asked. ""Our children are listening.”Biden had invited four children up on stage joking as he draped his arm around a boy that ""he gave me permission to touch him.""He'd made a similar comment at the beginning of his appearance after he hugged IBEW international president Lonnie Stephenson.Biden's speech was his first following allegations of unwanted touching by several women.Besides acknowledging with humor the recent controversy about his affectionate style Biden also addressed what he called criticism from some on the far left for his willingness to work with Republicans.Biden was forced to backtrack last month after being lambasted by progressives and LGBTQ activists for calling Vice President Mike PenceThe longtime politician made the case for Democrats and Republicans forging personal connections so the two parties can find ways to compromise instead of attacking each other.""Hard to get to yes in a compromise when you can't even talk to one another"" he said. ""Democrats and Republicans can do better.""Speaking to reporters afterward Biden defended himself against criticism that the Democratic Party has become more liberal than he is. Biden said that while the definition of ""progressive"" seems to have changed into whether someone calls themselves a socialist most members of the party are still basically liberal-to-moderate Democrats ""in the traditional sense.""""We'll find out whether I can win in a primary"" he said.Biden also said his intention has been to be the last Democrat to announce if he decides to enter the 2020 campaign.""Give everybody else their day then I get a shot then off to the races"" he said.Don't expect former veep to dwell on allegations in Friday speecMocking Biden Trump tweets bizarre doctored video appearing to show former VP sniffing own haiThe IBEW members Biden spoke to are the kind of blue-collar workers who helped propel Trump to the White House in 2016.""It’s good to be home” Biden said after walking on stage.

Trump signed the bill into law last March.The states and U.S. territories have spent much of those funds on cybersecurity and voting equipment according toa report to be released Thursday by the Election Assistance Commissio. USA TODAY received an advance copy of the report.States spent money to train staff hire cybersecurity experts and test their system vulnerability to hacking. Some also upgraded and replaced voting machines added paper ballots and set up post-election audits.Christy McCormick chairwoman of the commission said state election officials “rose to the occasion” spending the federal funds on short and long-term projects.The “funds have been used to make a tangible difference in the efficiency security accessibility and integrity of American elections” McCormick said in a statement.Report says paper trails are needed to thwart cyberattackHere’s how states spent the mone–  Alabama used the $6.1 million in federal funds to help replace old voting machines and set up rules for post-election audits.– Minnesota used its $6.9 million to among other things modernize its voter registration system and upgrade its cybersecurity technology.– Washington D.C. used nearly $400000 to buy new machines and hire more people to staff early-voting centers.– Rhode Island spent some of its $3 million to add layers of protection for its voter-registration system.Election officials have called the funding a “down payment” and say they need more for upcoming elections. Lawmakers and election officialspushed for the extra funding after U.S. intelligence reports that Russians tried to meddlen the 2016 presidential election.“These funds serve as an important initial federal investment in our elections systems but cybersecurity is not a destination’’ said Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie M.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps: Trump plans to designate military unit as a terrorist group - The Washington PosTry 1 month for $Trump to designate Iranian military unit as a terrorist grouNational reporter focusing on foreign policy and State DepartmenApril 8 at 6:40 PThe United States moved Monday to list Iran’s elite military Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization as the Trump administration looks for new ways to increase economic and political pressure on the Islamic regime in Tehran.The designation marks the first time Washington has branded a foreign government entity a terrorist group and came despite warnings from U.S. military and intelligence officials that other nations could use the designation as a precedent against U.S. action abroad.also comes one day before Israeli elections in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a fifth term by highlighting his close ties to the Trump administration and hawkish promises to battle threatening Iranian behavior across the Middle East.“This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences” President Trump said in a statement. “We will continue to increase financial pressure and raise the costs on the Iranian regime for its support of terrorist activity until it abandons its malign and outlaw behavior.”Who are the Revolutionary Guards? A look at the Iranian military unit Trump has deemed terrorists.U.S. officials have long said the IRGC’s opaque structure and far-flung responsibilities provided a mask for terrorist activities that threaten Israelis Europeans and U.S. forces and whether to make the designation has been debated for years. But prior administrations refrained from taking that step because of concerns that other nations could similarly target U.S. national security agencies putting American officials and military personnel at risk of being detained while traveling abroad.President Trump steps off Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on April 6 in Washington after returning from a trip to California and Nevada. (Alex Brandon/AP)The move continues the administration’s aggressive posture toward Iran which includes U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. Trump’s critics warn that the administration is flirting with a potential military conflict in the region.The Iranian government immediately condemned the designation Monday and alleged that it was done to boost Netanyahu’s electoral chances.“A(nother) misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu. A(nother) dangerous U.S. misadventure in the region” Iran’s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded on Twitter in English.IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari issued an implied threat against U.S. forces in the Middle East.“With this stupidity the American army and security forces will no longer have today’s calm in the west Asia region” the IRGC-affiliated Fars News Agency quoted him as saying.The Supreme National Security Council of Iran responded Monday by branding “the government of the United States as a supporter of terrorism and Central Command also known as Centcom and all of its affiliated forces as terrorist groups” state news agency IRNA reported.The terrorist designation which takes effect April 16 will allow the Trump administration to seek criminal penalties against elements of the military agency and foreign officials deemed to be aiding it as well as allow Washington to ban travel to the United States for individuals associated with military unit.The IRGC is a military unit originally set up as security for Iran’s clerical rulers. It has grown to be the country’s most powerful security organization with nearly unchecked political influence and interests in business real estate and other areas of the economy. The United States blames the IRGC for facilitating U.S. service member deaths in Iraq and elsewhere through financing training and weapons support to terrorist networks.Trump called the group “the Iranian government’s primary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign” and said Iran uses the unit to promote terrorism as official state policy.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the move will “deprive the world’s leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death.”“The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization but none of us should be fooled” Pompeo told reporters in making the formal announcement. He said the “blood of 603 American soldiers Iran killed in Iraq” is on the hands of the IRGC.“With this designation the Trump administration is simply recognizing reality” he added. “Our designation makes clear to the world that the IRGC not just supports other terrorist groups but engages in terrorism itself.”Pompeo denied that the timing of the announcement had anything to do with Israeli elections Tuesday.“It happened today because today was the day we were ready to make the announcement” he said on Fox News.Matt Levitt a former Treasury Department official who is director of the counterterrorism program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy said the move may have unintended consequences. Among the possibilities he reeled off: That Russia and China may start designating U.S. agencies for punitive actions or that Iraq could be caught in a double bind as it purchases electricity from Iran including from entities tied to the IRGC.“When you take it all into account the big question at the end of the day is what does this tangibly add to our tool kit?” Levitt said. “It does add some things but I’m not convinced they’re all that significant.”U.S. officials said the designation is the next step in what the Trump administration calls its “maximum pressure campaign” against Iran.The administration had previously named the IRGC as a supporter of terrorism conducted by militias it supports but stopped short of listing it as a foreign terrorist organization in 2017. In 2018 Trump withdrew the United States from the international nuclear deal with Iran.Pompeo said the designation makes clear that the IRGC is not just a behind-the-scenes enabler of terrorism but is also a direct participant in planning and carrying out attacks.Brian Hook the State Department’s principal adviser on Iran called the IRGC an architect and the principal enforcer of Iran’s foreign policy ever since the 1979 revolution. He alternately compared it to the mafia and a death cult.“I think it’s important in this case today we’re adding an additional layer of sanctions on the IRGC to make radioactive those sectors of Iran’s economy that are influenced or controlled by the IRGC” he said.The designation is likely to complicate U.S. actions in Iraq where U.S. troops work to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State and where Shiite militias tied to the IRGC operate close by. The IRGC is also tied to Hezbollah in Lebanon where the political wing of the terrorist group is part of the government.Netanyahu who faces corruption allegations and a tough reelection fight against a former military chief cast the U.S. move as a sign of his influence with the United States.“Thank you my dear friend President Donald Trump for having decided to announce Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization” Netanyahu wrote on Twitter in Hebrew. “Thank you for the answer to another important request that serves the interests of our country and the region. We will continue to act together in any way against the Iranian regime that threatens the state of Israel the United States and the Peace of the world.”Israel’s high-stakes elections: What you need to know as Netanyahu faces his toughest tesIn an English version Netanyahu omitted the reference to his “request” for the U.S. action. The United States is Israel’s most important ally and Netanyahu has told voters his close relationship with Trump has paid off with tough U.S. action against Iran. Trump also last month backed Netanyahu and appeared to put a thumb on the Israeli election scale by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights seized from Syria in 1967.Since 1993 the U.S. government has used the foreign terrorist organization designation more than 60 times. It is a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison to provide material support to one.The designation puts further distance between Trump’s policies toward Iran and those of European allies who remain a part of the nuclear deal.A senior German security official said that the designation is not out of bounds because the IRGC “is an organization which is committing terroristic acts” but that Europe is unlikely to follow suit because of diplomatic and business ties to Iran.“In that matter Trump is right” said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to talk about the subject with the media. “They do interfere severely in the Middle East and they have also plotted terroristic acts in Europe.”Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Tex.) the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee applauded the decision as a proper escalation after U.S. steps to isolate and punish just the IRGC’s Quds Force a subset of the guard corps “did not dissuade Iran from using its funding weapons and personnel to engage in deadly violence around the world.”“This designation ends the facade that the IRGC is part of a normal military” McCaul said in a statement. “They behave like a terrorist organization and will now be treated accordingly.”The idea of designating the unit has carried some bipartisan support for years. U.S. officials noted Monday that in 2007 Senators Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) signed onto a bill urging President George W. Bush to make the IRGC designation. Once elected president however Obama backed off that stance concluding that the designation would create more risk than reward.Mark Dubowitz chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said the designation is welcome.“It is fitting that the most dangerous terrorist group in the world responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of innocents and backed by a massive state apparatus and vast energy wealth is being designated finally as a foreign terrorist organization” Dubowitz said.Souad Mekhennet in Washington and Erin Cunningham in Istanbul contributed to this report.‘I’ve been battling Nadler for years’: Feud between Trump Democrat rooted in decades-old New York real estate projectSecret Service chief is leaving Trump administration White House saysThe Daily 202: Trump keeps pushing legal boundaries — and 10 other takeaways from Kirstjen Nielsen’s ousterTrump to designate Iranian military unit as a terrorist groupKirstjen Nielsen just revealed how Trump’s pathologies and lawlessness will get worseEnd the charade.

‘I’ve been battling Nadler for years’: Feud between Trump Democrat rooted in decades-old New York real estate project - The Washington PosTry 1 month for $‘I’ve been battling Nadler for years’: Feud between Trump Democrat rooted in decades-old New York real estate projecDonald Trump stands with a model of “Television City” his proposed development along the Hudson River between 59th and 72nd streets in New York in November 1985. (Bettmann Archive)Reporter covering the White HousApril 8 at 6:36 PAssembling a group of House Republicans at the White House to talk trade last month President Trump suddenly launched into a tirade about the congressman leading an extensive investigation into his presidency:his New York antagonist Rep. Jerrold Nadler.“Fat Jerry” Trump called the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee as he prattled on about Nadler’s weight-loss surgery in the 2000s and suggested that the Democrat was still overweight despite it.“I’ve been battling Nadler for years” Trump told the GOP lawmakers who were embarrassed by the outburst according to several individuals in the room who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the remarks.Trump and Nadler are currently the main foes in a constitutional clash over executive power as Nadler aggressively moves to investigate the president’s conduct and weighs whether to hold impeachment proceedings. But Trump’s jabs at Nadler were a fresh reminder that the animosity between the two native New Yorkers is personal as well as political — rooted in a decades-old fight over a tract of New York City real estate.The feud between Trump 72 and Nadler 71 began in the 1980s when Nadler a New York state assemblyman and later congressman proved to be a major obstacle to a vast development project that Trump envisioned for Manhattan’s West Side Nadler’s turf.“Jerry was on him from Day One” said Linda Rosenthal a former Nadler aide who later won his state Assembly seat. “He keenly understood that this was a man who would try to get the government to pay for all his mostly bollixed attempts at development . . . His casinos failed. He lost money on deals. He left the banks on the hook for his bad financial plans. . . . He was just such a braggart and such an insincere person but Jerry saw through that.”Trump never forgave Nadler and privately he has simmered about the chairman and his investigation calling him an irritant who has long been out to get him and recounting their New York run-ins to aides. He was alarmed by the chairman’s early March demands to 81 of Trump’s close associates and business partners for a range of documents including material on Russia’s election interference and the president’s finances.Trump has told White House aides to block the requests as much as possible according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.House Democrats demand documents from more than 80 people and institutions affiliated with TrumThe White House declined to comment. Nadler declined to be interviewed for this article.The feud began in 1985 when Trump purchased a dilapidated former railroad yard in Nadler’s assembly district and proposed turning it into a mega-community: 7600 apartments in six 75-story towers surrounded by television stations a shopping mall a massive 7600-car parking garage and the world’s tallest building — a 150-story skyscraper.Already considered a real estate go-getter in his late 30s Trump wanted to call his development along the Hudson River between 59th and 72nd streets “Television City” and he predicted that it would be “the greatest piece of land in urban America.”But the proposal generated fierce community opposition from locals who feared that the area would become too commercialized and congested. Standing with them was Nadler who wanted the city to buy the land and upgrade the rail system to preserve middle-class transportation jobs.Opposition to the project helped Nadler burnish his liberal reputation as he fought the Queens-born real estate developer whom many in Manhattan considered an interloper.Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) pictured in 1993. Seated to his left is future senator Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). (CQ Archive/AP)The two men came from widely different backgrounds. Trump was a developer a son of wealth who reportedly flattered politicians to win tax breaks and financial assistance that could help his business.Nadler was a son of a New Jersey chicken farmer who moved to New York when the farm went belly-up. Suspicious of big developers he built his career siding with the working class and preferred scholarly justifications for his actions rather than impassioned rhetoric.Trump was undeterred by the resistance. He invited Nadler to see models of his towers that would rise above the city. When Nadler inquired about the purpose of the soaring skyscraper Trump said he wasn’t sure but knew he wanted to live in the penthouse so high in the sky that he would have to call the concierge to find out what the weather was below.Nadler told associates that he found the display “grotesque” and it cemented in his mind an image of Trump as a greedy man trying to take advantage of the system. Nadler teamed with community groups to wage legal and procedural fights to scuttle the project.“Trump only wanted to build what he wanted to build. . . . It was like a joke” said Ruth Messinger a Nadler ally who was on the New York City Council at the time and also strongly opposed Trump’s 150-story building. “Nadler was just representing his constituency saying why they didn’t want it.”As the project stalled Trump offered a compromise dropping his prized skyscraper scaling back the heights of his proposed towers and agreeing to build a 22-acre park by the Hudson — the linchpin of the deal that included plans to tear down and relocate part of a highway obstructing waterfront views.Nadler would have none of it. When he won the nomination to succeed the late U.S. representative Ted Weiss in a special election in the fall of 1992 Nadler talked openly about using his new power at the federal level to ensure that Trump didn’t receive a dime for his bid to move the highway.Once in Washington Nadler panned Trump’s plea for federal assistance as “Trump pork” and worked behind the scenes to write into law a prohibition on any money for relocating a stretch of the highway a cost he put at $350 million.“It is outrageous at a time of deep budget cuts that Mr. Trump would seek a down payment from working Americans for his luxury high-rise development in Manhattan” Nadler said in July 1995. “Why should taxpayers be asked to chip in for this massive and wasteful boondoggle?”Trump called Nadler’s estimates “garbage” labeled the congressman “dumb” and accused him of playing “to his small group of constituents while ignoring the needs of the rest of the city.” He piled on the insults.“If Nadler spent more time in a gymnasium losing weight he would do the voters a bigger service” Trump said. “He needs to lose about 200 pounds.”Nadler who had weight-loss surgery in 2002 has worked for decades to change his lifestyle and has reduced his size considerably.After the congressman blocked the public funds Trump tried to claim victory anyway arguing that “Fat Jerry Nadler is doing me a favor” because he’d have to spend less money if the highway stayed put.“He’s too stupid to realize it” Trump said. “He’s making me a lot of money.”Nadler’s office countered that the lawmaker “never went bankrupt and had to spend his father’s fortune to keep his family’s business afloat.”House Democrats request 10 years of Trump financial recordWhen Trump pushed for a loan guarantee with the Federal Housing Administration Nadler worked to deny Trump mortgage insurance which would allow him to borrow money at a lower interest rate. He personally lobbied then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo pointing out that Trump’s apartments included only a small percentage of affordable housing units so they did not qualify for assistance.Trump later leaned on GOP allies to whom he had donated to secure an earmark for his project. It created an unusual dynamic in which Trump-allied lawmakers lobbied for money that wouldn’t even go to their districts while Nadler worked to cut funds for development in his own neighborhood.In the end Trump never got the highway moved but Nadler never got Trump to abandon the project entirely. Trump ensured the construction of 20 residential buildings but in 2005 with parts of the 1.8 million-square-foot complex still under construction from years of delays and opposition Trump sold the property for $1.8 billion.After Trump’s election residents of the apartment complex voted to have his name removed from the property a repudiation of the man who fought for its very existence.A workman holds up the letter “T” in November 2016 as a crew removes the name from a New York building formerly known as Trump Place. Hundreds of tenants had signed a petition saying they were embarrassed to live in a place associated with the president-elect. (Seth Wenig/AP)This year with Democrats in the majority in the House Nadler has built a massive legal team to scrutinize Trump’s moves hiring high-profile lawyers who have criticized the president in the past.Trump’s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani — who said he worked closely with and always got along with Nadler when he was New York mayor in the late 1990s — is encouraging Trump to resist the Judiciary Committee investigation because “they have already announced he’s guilty.”Nadler according to associates is not intimidated by Trump. After Trump won the election the congressman wrote about how the country could not normalize Trump’s conduct. The lawmaker’s allies have been surprised that Trump has not given him a public nickname although Nadler often tells with pride the story of Trump calling him a political hack.Rosenthal said that Nadler’s “tangles with Trump in the past make him perfectly suited” to investigate the president. “Trump knows what Jerry’s like. He knows how smart he is. He knows that he’s relentless. And Trump’s obviously upset that he can’t control him.”Alice Crites contributed to this report.‘I’ve been battling Nadler for years’: Feud between Trump Democrat rooted in decades-old New York real estate projectSecret Service chief is leaving Trump administration White House saysThe Daily 202: Trump keeps pushing legal boundaries — and 10 other takeaways from Kirstjen Nielsen’s ousterTrump to designate Iranian military unit as a terrorist groupKirstjen Nielsen just revealed how Trump’s pathologies and lawlessness will get worseEnd the charade.

The assumption that Jews vote as a bloc in their own interests is a common anti-Semitic trope.During his speech Trump mocked Rep.

(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)During her tumultuous tenure with the Trump administration Nielsen who previously served as chief of staff to former DHS Secretary John Kelly faced criticism from both current and former DHS officials as well as White House aides and ultimately the president.Nielsen initially followed Kelly to the White House when he took over as chief of staff in September 2017 but shewith West Wing aides. Despite concerns over her lack of experience Trump nominated Nielsen in October 2017 to replace Kelly in the Cabinet and she was easily confirmed in December. She is the sixth head of Homeland Security since it was established in 2002.For months Trump has reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with Nielsen’s performance on the border. Kevin Landy who led ICE’s Office of Detention Policy and Planning under the Obama administration told Yahoo News that ongoing clashes between the president and the DHS secretary seemed to stem from the fact that “she couldn’t solve what he considers a border crisis by changing the law unilaterally or miraculously generating resources that Congress hasn’t funded.”“The same legal and funding constraints facing DHS now are going to continue to face DHS whoever the new secretary is” said Landy. “Trump seems to be on the edge of insanity when it comes to the border influx and he seems incapable of dealing with the reality that there are no easy solutions.”President Trump greets then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Friday.

(Photo: Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)Democrats empowered after the 2018 elections gave them control of the House recently requested six years of the president’s personal tax returns under a provision in the federal tax code that says the IRS “shall furnish” any filer’s tax return information to the chairs of three congressional committees “upon written request.”House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal D-Mass. sent a letter to the IRS Wednesday formally asking for the returns and giving a deadline of April 10.""This request is about policy not politics” Neal said in a. “My preparations were made on my own track and timeline entirely independent of other activities in Congress and the Administration. My actions reflect an abiding reverence for our democracy and our institutions and are in no way based on emotion of the moment or partisanship.""Still Republicans accused Democrats of weaponizing the tax code against Trump and argued their actions would threaten taxpayers’ privacy rights and set a dangerous precedent.In recent precedent presidential candidates have released their returns which is not required by law. Trump however backed off his promise to do so and refused to release them claiming he was under audit.On Friday Trump repeated the claim. ""I’m under audit. When you’re under audit you don’t do it.""""From what I understand the law is 100 percent on my side"" he also said.Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney also told “Fox News Sunday” that the request was “political hit job.”“You always expect something from the Democrats” said Mulvaney who also serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget. “If they don’t get what they want from the Mueller report they’re going to ask for the taxes. If they don’t get what they want on the taxes they’ll ask for something else.”""They know one of the fundamental principles of the IRS is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes” continued Mulvaney. ""They know the terms under law by which the IRS can give them the documents but 'political hit job' is not one of those reasons.""When asked if he believes Democrats will ever see Trump’s tax returns Mulvaney said ""Oh no never.”“Nor should they” he added. “Keep in mind that's an issue that was already litigated during the [2016] election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns they knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway which of course is what drives the Democrats crazy. But they know they're not going to get this.”Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecFox News Host Jeanine Pirro To Blame For Omar Death Threats Says AOS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes Add to Supply ConcernExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicFather allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisGabrielle Union cheers on Dwyane Wade's son at gay pride paradSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesThere's Still Time to Make This Smart Move to Lower Your Taxes AND Boost Your Retiremen",1

However the sources cautioned that the blacklist at least as discussed isn’t likely to be implemented anytime soon given the difficulties of enforcing it with an interconnected global military supply chain estimated at some $100 billion.""The Department of Defense continually reviews and assesses various supply chain risk factors when deciding what courses of action to take in defense of our national security” wrote Lt Col Mike Andrews a department spokesman in an email to Yahoo News.“The Department of Defense continues to work through the interagency process to communicate on such matters with other Federal agencies Congress and industry for improved protection across the National Security Innovation Base.""The proposed blacklist comes as the U.S. government has doubled down in recent months on what it regards as a growing threat of foreign adversaries spying on private sector companies important to infrastructure and defense. One of the main concerns of the Trump administration has been about China’s growing dominance in 5G the next generation of mobile communications which will allow for lightning-fast downloads and futuristic “smart” cities.China officials say is the primary threat and they point to a growing list of indictments for industrial espionage and theft of trade secrets from the Department of Justice that illustrates that reality.“Supply chain cannot be that fuzzy word we’re uncomfortable with” said Bill Evanina acting director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Centerat an event earlier this month. “The mistakes we’ve made for decades have to be fixed.”Trying to guard the supply chain is no easy task. At Lockheed Martin one of the Pentagon’s largest contractors there are over 20000 different companies in the supply chain according to James Connelly the company’s vice president and chief information security officer speaking at the same event.The threats appear to be growing as defense companies increasingly rely on a complex network of suppliers for both hardware and software. Last week for example Vice’s Motherboarthat sophisticated hackers used Taiwanese technology company ASUS’s software to push malicious security updates to “thousands of its customers’ computers last year.”In January the Justice Department indicted Huawei for stealing data from T-Mobile and in 2018 the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security warned that Russian hackers were targeting suppliers for energy utility companies to access and surveil the industrial control systems.A staff member of Huawei uses her mobile phone at the Huawei Digital Transformation Showcase in Shenzhen in China's Guangdong province on March 6 2019. (Photo: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images)The administration appears to be making a concerted effort to focus on supply-chain issues. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence hasNational Supply Chain Integrity Month” and the Department of Homeland Security in November formed a Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force. Also a new Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Council will meet for the first time this month.But blacklisting a company because of its supply-chain risks may prove to be difficult to implement. Although such a blacklist might be helpful for counterintelligence naming and shaming U.S. companies will open up the government to lawsuits. An alleged offender determined to make a sale could disappear and reappear under a slightly different name months later said one senior national security official.But for companies operating in a global marketplace the process for engaging with the Pentagon on mitigating supply-chain risks can be opaque. the Pentagon has reserved the power to block companies from getting military contracts based on what it deems a “supply chain risk” without providing transparency on how companies can allay those concerns.For the government whose national security officials see security threats around every corner the “black box” strategy makes sense as a way to avoid tipping off the adversary on how to evade scrutiny. However it has made life difficult for the many companies hoping to do legitimate business around the world.In some ways the desire to come up with a blacklist of companies with supply risks mirrors the White House’s approach to 5G. Although the issue of commercial 5G is distinct from that of the supply chain blacklist which would be limited to Pentagon contractors securing future networks and ensuring the supply chain for U.S. weapons are linked.Both efforts have required a broad — but still undefined — strategy beyond bans and blacklists say officials who acknowledge there are few easy solutions.The Trump White House has reportedly planned to place a ban on Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE for their 5G development but no executive order has been issued. More recently senior U.S. national security officials have insisted that the Trump White House strategy on defending future 5G networks is “country and company agnostic.”Meanwhile rolling back China’s 5G dominance may prove difficult. Huawei and ZTE have already made deals with countries around the world to implement 5G technology for cheaper costs and with better technology — and key allies like the United Kingdom and Germany don’t appear to be onboard with the White House’s approach.ZTE's company logo displayed on a smartphone. (Photo: Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)Although the U.K’s National Cyber Security Centre declared Huawei products insecure and open to possible vulnerabilities the U.K. government has not come down hard against working with Huawei on 5G. German officials have also expressed public hesitation about banning Huawei from German networks.Upal Basu of NGP Capital the investing arm backed by Nokia that has invested in companies in the United States and China says the focus should be on the United States working to maintain its own advantage in 5G “instead of focusing on Huawei.”Huawei he argues has become a “scapegoat” due to its murky connections to the Chinese government. “Our desire is that this network rolls out quickly and the policy does not slow this down” he told Yahoo News.The United States can try to “impose requirements on allies that ‘thou shalt not use Huawei’” he said but it’s hard to convince other countries of that position amid the ongoing trade war with China and the competitive package Huawei is offering. Instead he argues the United States should invest in its own 5G networks.The resistance to an outright ban on Chinese companies and 5G may be making an impact on U.S. strategy. “It seems they are getting cold feet” said retired Brig. Gen. Robert Spalding a former National Security Council official focused on 5G and emerging threats.“There is no agreement” within the White House on how to deal with the 5G issue said James Lewis the director of the technology policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Just that Huawei is a risk that we need to do something about.”The barriers to coming up with a solution to supply-chain security could prove similar to what happened with 5G: Bans and blacklists sound like easy fixes but they end up being complex to implement and politically sensitive. Instead top intelligence officials have been forced to turn to the private sector where the vulnerable underbelly of government security is located.“I hear CEOs say ‘Hey we have the best cyber program’” said Evanina the FBI official. “What about [human resources] your procurement and acquisition folks?”“That’s your weakest link ... how much [counterintelligence] training do they get?”Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanThe H-20 and JH-XX: China's Two (Yes Two) New Stealth BomberOregon college students busted for making $900000 in fraudulent Apple iPhone returns feds saOil climbs to 5-month highs as Libyan conflict feeds expectations of tighter global supplieExplained: Why Taiwan Needs New Submarines to Deter ChinU.S. Investors Reassured by Rebound in Jobs CreatioAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in Ugand",1

Background: Fred Trump. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP (3) Getty Images)Call him “Patient 1”: An individual in Washington D.C. who presents with symptoms of mental decline including a bizarre inability to remember where his own father was born. a psychiatrist on the faculty at the Yale School of Medicine has some insights to share which we will get to in a moment.On Tuesday at a meeting with the secretary-general of NATO President Trump launched into an impromptu riff on one of his favorite topics the reluctance of America’s wealthy European allies to pay more toward their own defense. Then in what might have been a clumsy effort to show no hard feelings heexpressed his love for German the ancestral home of the Trump (or originally“My father is German right? Was German. And born in a very wonderful place in Germany so I have a great feeling for Germany.”was born in 1905 in the Bron approximately 4000 miles from Germany as the accompanying map shows. Trump’s grandfather was born in Germany but was living in the United States with his wife when Frederick was born.Frederick Trump's birth certificate from the state of New York borough of the Bronx.Of all Trump’s many misstatements exaggerations empty boasts and slips of the tongue this one — which Trump has made at least twice before — stands out for its sheer inexplicability. Ordinarily when Trump says something ridiculous it’s for an obvious purpose. He has been onan unhinged rant recently about windmillfunction in the electrical grid he misunderstandand whose sound he says causes cancer. That is an assertion for which the White House was unable to provide any support because he unquestionably made it up. But at least it’s consistent with his general disdain for environmentalism and explainable by his self-interest in fighting to stop an offshore wind farm that he believes will ruin the views from one of his golf resorts in Scotland. And it is strictly speaking unfalsifiable; the carcinogenic effect of windmill noise like a lot of other nonsensical beliefs hasn’t been scientifically studied so all you can say is that there’s no evidence for it.But there’s a New York birth certificate that contradicts Trump’s claim about his father and no obvious advantage for him to make up a story about it. To the contrary Trump early in his career disguised his German ancestryclaiming his family was actually from Swede a lie that apparently was intended to make it easier to do business in a city with the largest Jewish population in the world. And in his first memoir “The Art of the Deal” he wrote that his father’s “classic Horatio Alger” story began with his birth “in New Jersey in 1905.” The Bronx is only just across the Hudson River from New Jersey but it is in a whole different state. but one can imagine Freudian explanations for this peculiar assertion or at least I can. Mistakes Sigmund Freud theorized are often the key to hidden feelings and memories. Is it just a coincidence that Trump who got his start in national politics by peddling a conspiracy theory about his predecessor’s family and birthplace and who constantly measures himself against him repeatedly makes the same bizarre gaffe about where his own father was born? Is it resentment toward his overbearing father who made a fortune building apartment houses in the outer boroughs and reportedly never quite trusted his son’s foray into glamorous Manhattan real estate? Someone I know who worked closely with Trump in the early 1990s when his casino empire was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy recalls him saying dolefully at the time “I should have listened to my father and stuck with Brooklyn. My father is going to say ‘I told you so.’”Of course I’m no psychiatrist. But that holds the advantage that I am not bound by the American Psychiatric Association’s “” which forbids members to offer opinions at a distance on the mental health of public figures. The provision was added to the profession’s code of ethics after a number of psychiatrists publicly speculated on the fitness and stability of 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. He of course never became president but Trump’s ascendance has prompted a number of prominent psychiatrists to declare an overriding emergency. Organized as theWorld Mental Health Coalition they held a conference in Washington last month on “The Dangerous State of the World and the Need for Fit Leadership.”“We are talking about the profound danger of the mentally unstable individual who holds the highest office in this country and most powerful single office in the entire world” said one of the speakers Jeffrey Sachs a Columbia University economist.“He is rapidly declining” Lee the group’s president said of Trump in an interview. “His rallies have been increasingly less coherent with greater signs of paranoid responses increasing attraction to violence increasing espousal of conspiracy theories. A few weeks ago there was the ‘ and the other day he referred to Venezuela as a company while recently he confused his father’s birthplace with his grandfather’s.“His mistakes are growing more and more bizarre” Lee said. “If we match the pattern of his deterioration against pathology what disease states look like we can say he is not well.“Continually we have been seeing that his erratic thoughts and behavior are more consistent with mental pathology than strategy. Now we are seeing a pattern of cognitive decline.”Shortly after Trump took office Lee edited a book called “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump” a collection of essays by mental health professionals which recently appeared in a second edition. “What we said then was that he was worse than he appeared in public and would grow more dangerous over time. That his mental pathology would spread into his administration and the population.” She referenced a phenomenon called “shared psychosis” in which delusions spread from one family member to his or her relatives.“In terms of the presidency” she said “the nation is the family. That is what we’re seeing now. One of the first things you lose is the ability to recognize that something is not right and to get help. An increasing proportion of the population is unable to recognize that something is not right. What you do in such a situation is contain the person remove them from access to weapons and do an urgent evaluation. Then you manage the person in the least restrictive manner according to the results of the evaluation.”Lee said her organization was “in the process of forming an expert panel that can test fitness for duty” by presidential candidates pointing out that military officers in control of nuclear weapons undergo regular psychological evaluations. The exam she has in mind tests for such things as the ability to consider the consequences of decisions to follow a logical train of thought and to understand and explain back a story or scenario.I think that would be a good thing to do for Trump and for any of his would-be successors.But if I were administering the test I’d start with one simple question:“Do you know where your father was born?”Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?A Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes Add to Supply ConcernAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesProsecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock',1

Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y. told Yahoo News that pursuing the impeachment of President Trump is “extremely premature” but there is still a possibility Democrats could seek to oust the president.“It’s off the table until it’s on the table. And at the moment it’s off the table” Jeffries said.Jeffries echoed what he has said in the past which is that he has agreed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s assessment of what would be necessary to move forward with impeachment proceedings.“As Speaker Pelosi has indicated we should only go down that road if the case is compelling the evidence is overwhelming and the public sentiment around impeachment is bipartisan in nature” Jeffries said. “Those conditions don’t exist right now.”Yahoo News spoke on Friday by phone with Jeffries the fifth-highest-ranking House Democrat shortly after he delivered a blistering speech in which he cited some of the close Trump associates who are facing jail time after special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries D-N.Y. (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters)Jeffries compared their situation to the Biblical story of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego three men thrown into a furnace on a king’s order when they refused to worship a false idol. “Sometimes you’ve got such an arrogant narcissistic self-centered out of control ruler that the people closest to him are the first ones to go down in flames” Jeffries said.Jeffries went on to shout the names of top Trump campaign aides who were charged as part of Mueller’s probe.Late last month Trump declared himself exonerated after Attorney General William Barrsummarizing Mueller’s report. According to Barr Mueller did not find evidence Trump’s campaign team had colluded with Russian attempts to interfere with the election and declined to make a decision whether the president should be charged with obstruction of justice. Reports have since emerged that Mueller prepared his own public statement on his conclusions and that members of the special counsel’s team were frustrated with Barr’s summary.Jeffries blasted Barr’s letter and said House Democrats will “do everything possible within the law” to ensure Mueller’s full report is released publicly.“The Barr letter seems to me to be a complete and total fraud and recent reports that public summaries had been prepared by the Mueller team for the American people only provide further evidence that we need to get a full and complete understanding of the work that the Mueller team did” Jeffries said in the interview with Yahoo News.Jeffries argued Trump is “hiding” Mueller’s report from the American people despite claiming that it vindicates him.“This is a smoke and mirrors presidency” Jeffries said.Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because ‘the man lies’Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos’s phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?A Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes Add to Supply ConcernAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburGaza animals find new home following deaths at zoU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Beto O'Rourke Calls Benjamin Netanyahu A 'Racist' Says U.S.-Israel Relationship Must 'Transcend' HiChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesWife of ex-Nissan boss Ghosn appeals to French government for hel,1

The sector is full. Can’t take you anymore I’m sorry. Can’t happen. So turn around that’s the way it is.”Trump described his remarks as “our new statement” and said it applied to asylum seekers as well as immigrants crossing the border illegally.“If you look at our southern border the number of people and the amount of drugs human trafficking — the human trafficking is something that nobody used to talk about I talk about it. It’s a terrible thing. It’s ancient and it’s never been bigger than it is modern right now today. All over the world by the way not just here. All over the world human trafficking a terrible thing.”According to figures provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials the number of people arrested for illegallyrose from 47986 in January to 66450 in February. Families many traveling from Central American countries made up more than half of those numbers CBP said.While arrests of criminal aliens have continued to fall the past two years Trump assured his audience that “there is indeed an emergency on our southern border.”“It’s a colossal surge” Trump said of the migrant caravans from Central America “and it’s overwhelming our immigration system. We can’t take you anymore.”Specifically Trump singled out those seeking asylum saying that a large number of them were gang members.“It’s a scam. It’s a hoax” Trump said. “I know about hoaxes. I just went through a hoax” which is how he refers to special counselof his campaign’s ties to the Russian government.At the same time Trump proclaimed that Mexico “has been absolutely terrific for the last four days” arresting “thousands” of Central American migrants before they could reach the U.S. border. But then the president issued another warning.“If for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the U.S. will be forced to tariff at 25 percent all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the border to us. If that doesn’t work I will close the border” Trump vowed.Trump had backed off from that threat earlier in the week after lawmakers from both parties threw cold water on the idea.“Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned.Shutting down America’s southern border would threaten American jobs &amp; our broader economy while also running counter to our nation’s values.As for the country being “full” the United States with aof 35 people per square kilometer ranks 175th of 240 countries between Venezuela and Kyrgyzstan.Trump’s rolling up the welcome mat for immigrants stands in opposition to the long-standing American tradition of welcoming immigrants summed up by the lines in Emma Lazarus’s poem “The New Colossus” inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty. “Give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...”In February Trump painted a very different picture regarding the country’s need for new immigrants.“I need people coming in because we need people to run the factories and plants and companies that are moving back in” Trump told reporters in February. “We need people.”Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanLori Loughlin &amp; Felicity Huffman Might Go To Jail But That Doesn't Mean Their Careers Are OveAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Compromise?

However the force of more than 20000 law enforcement and support personnel has been operating without a Senate-confirmed director since Trump took office and appointed Thomas Homan as acting ICE chief.Acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello listens as President Trump talks about the border on Feb. 1. (Photo: Jim Watson/ AFP/Getty Images)A 30-year immigration enforcement veteranfor his work as executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations under President Barack Obama Homan eagerly embraced Trump’s pledge to crack down on illegal immigration. He quickly ramped up arrests of undocumented immigrants across the country and became a vocal critic of sanctuary cities.Homan effectively ran the agency for nearly 10 months before Trump officially nominated him for the ICE director position in November 2017. Despite earning high praise from the president Homan’s handling of the agency raised concerns among Democrats in the Senate and his nomination did not make it far before Homan announced in April of last year that he would retire in June.Vitiello a longtime U.S. Border Patrol Agent and former senior border official was then tapped to take over for Homan bringing a decidedly lower-profile approach to the role than his outspoken predecessor who went on to become a Fox News contributor. Trump officially nominated the new acting director in August of last year.Vitiello encountered plenty of his own roadblocks on the road to confirmation however including concerns over controversial social media posts as well as his refusal to rule out future separations of immigrant families at the border.In February the Senate Committee on Homeland Security decided to postpone a vote on Vitiello for a second time after receivingfrom the president of the National ICE Council the pro-Trump union representing ICE officers outlining several issues with Vitiello’s “job performance record judgment character and credibility” which the organization said made him “unfit to serve as Director.”the committee voted on March 1to approve Vitiello’s nomination and it was on track for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee when Trump abruptly pulled the plugmany lawmakers and Homeland Security Officials by surprise.An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment and Trump has yet to offer any indication of whom he might be considering. In the meantime Vitiello remains the agency’s deputy and acting director.Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because ‘the man lies’Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos’s phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecUS economy will hit 3% growth this year: First Trust Advisors' Brian WesburS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaA Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in Ugand,1
window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');For Trump 'complete and total exoneration' ain't what it used to bFor Trump 'complete and total exoneration' ain't what it used to bNearly two weeks ago Attorney General William Barr’s summary of Robert Mueller’s investigation of collusion between Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and possible obstruction of justice shook up the worldview of the entire political and journalistic establishment.Barr’s four-page appraisal of Mueller’s nearly 400-page report was read as vindicating Trump of all wrongdoing and set off euphoric celebrations on Fox News among the president’s Republican loyalists in Congress and of course from the commander in chief himself.No Collusion No Obstruction Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Indeed while Barr’s book report specifically noted that Mueller’s report “does not exonerate” the president the upshot of the investigation was that Trump would be spared criminal prosecution. With the possible exception of Fox Business News host Lou Dobbs no one crowed louder over the investigation’s apparent conclusions louder than Trump himself.Robert Mueller was a God-like figure to the Democrats until he ruled No Collusion in the long awaited $30000000 Mueller Report. Now the Dems don’t even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again. It won’t happen!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)But as Barr set about considering which portions of the report were suitable for public view and which would be forever buried beneath a redacting tool’s bold black lines cracks began appearing in the case-closed façade.On Wednesday members of Mueller’s hitherto tight-lipped team began to speak of their frustrations with Barr’s recounting of the special counsel’s findings. Thethat “some” Mueller investigators had concluded that “Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump” than the attorney general had let on.Attorney General William Barr. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)Barr’s underlings seemed to walk back the notion that the attorney general’s letter was an actual summary of the special counsel’s report although no one in the office publicly disputed Trump’s characterization of the full report — which he apparently hasn’t read either — as a complete vindication.“Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter the Attorney General decided to release the report’s bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a Thursday statement.Soon the Washington Post NBC News and CNN had all matched the Times’s reporting contacting sources on Mueller’s team but to Trump it wasThe New York Times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the Mueller Report. In fact they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Not only did the Times stand by its reporting but their story (as well as those of their competitors) turned up the heat on Barr to make the full report public. Even before the revelations of discord at the Justice Department over Barr’s non-summary the public wasn’t buying the president’s spin on it. Areleased last Friday found that 75 percent of Americans think the full report should be made public and just 36 percent said the report cleared Trump of any wrongdoing.“You have already provided an interpretation of the Special Counsel’s conclusions in a fashion that appeared to minimize the implications of the report as to the President” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler wrote to Barr on Thursday. “Releasing the summaries — without delay — would begin to allow the American people to judge the facts for themselves.”House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP)Nadler is also preparing to subpoena the Justice Department for the full report and said Thursday that it would “very likely be necessary” for Mueller to testify before his committee.It may indeed fall to Mueller to clear up the discrepancy between the interpretations of Barr and what members of his team have leaked to the media. Before the release of Barr’s shorthand of the full report Trump stated he had no objections to Mueller’s findings being made public. “It wouldn’t bother me at all” Trump asserted one day after Barr’s condensed “CliffsNotes” version arrived. But this week the president backed away from that idea.In 1998 Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report which the Dems hate he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)It may well be true the Democrats in Congress will not be satisfied with another condensing of Mueller’s pages. As Rep. Adam Schiff D-Cailf. put it in a tweet last week Barr’s motives remain suspect for many in the party.Barr auditioned for the job with a memo saying a president cannot obstruct justice.Last weekend Barr did the job he was hired to do and attempted to exonerate the President on obstruction.The American people must see the full Mueller Report not a biased summary.Schiff now a prime target for his Republican colleagues and the president was referencing Barr’s 2018 memo to Justice Department officials which portrayed Mueller’s report as “fatally misconceived” and “legally unsupportable.” That memo cameTrump nominated him to serve as attorney general and has been credited with helping him secure the position. In essence it too was a preview summary of Mueller’s report before it had even been written.In summary the president and his team may well fight to keep the full report from ever seeing the light of day but every day that they do Trump’s claim of “complete and total exoneration” will seem less persuasive.Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanLori Loughlin &amp; Felicity Huffman Might Go To Jail But That Doesn't Mean Their Careers Are OveLe'Veon Bell shares James Conner's private message but this was a good onAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Gaza animals find new home following deaths at zoChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesBeto O'Rourke Calls Benjamin Netanyahu A 'Racist' Says U.S.-Israel Relationship Must 'Transcend' HiU.S. judge orders halt to Trump asylum seekers policThey’re fast they’re furious and they don’t have driver’s licenseFather allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homewor,1

Reminder: There are 304 days until the Iowa caucuses and 577 days until the 2020 presidential election.Who’s running for president? Click here for Yahoo News’ 2020 trackeSen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. on Friday endorsed eliminating the legislative filibuster in the Senate if Democrats take the White House. Speaking at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s National Action Network conference in New York City Warren framed the maneuver in a racial lens pointing out that a bill to make lynching a federal crime took a century to pass the Senate because of filibusters by “a small group of racists” — and went on to discuss Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s tactics in bogging down nominations to federal positions by former President Barack Obama.“I’m not running for president just to talk about making real structural change I’m serious about getting it done. And part of getting it done means waking up to the reality of the United States Senate” Warren said. “So let me be as clear as I can about this: When Democrats next have power we should be bold. We are done with two sets of rules one for the Republicans and one for the Democrats. And that means when the Democrats have the White House again if Mitch McConnell tries to do what he did to President Obama and put small-minded partisanship ahead of solving the massive problems in this country then we should get rid of the filibuster.”Sen. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. speaks at the National Action Network conference in New York City on Friday. (Photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters)With the legislative filibuster in place legislation needs 60 votes to pass the Senate while abolishing it would mean bills could pass with a simple majority. (Sixty-vote thresholds to confirm lower court and Supreme Court justices have been rolled back in recent years.) Supporters of the filibuster say it helps foster bipartisanship. Warren is the first major candidate to call for its abolition — her fellow Sens. Bernie Sanders Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have expressed skepticism at the idea — although Washington Gov. Jay Inslee a dark horse in the race called for its removal in February.“I do believe that the time for the filibuster has come and gone”. “It was an artifact of a bygone era that is not in the U.S. Constitution and somehow it got grafted on in this culture of the Senate.”Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. speaks at the 2019 National Action Network conference in New York City on Friday. (Photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters)Elizabeth Warren wasn’t the only 2020 candidate to appear at the NAN conference. In fact 13 presidential hopefuls took the stage this week at Al Sharpton’s annual event. And each of them was pressed on a key issue that has emerged in this very early stage of the 2020 campaign: paying slavery reparations to African-Americans.One by one Sharpton asked the candidates whether they would pledge to sign a bill proposed by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas to form a committee to study reparations if elected president. And they all did.I’m elected president I will sign that bill” Kamala Harris said drawing loud cheers from the crowd.Even Bernie Sanders who last monthtold a New York radio station that he was a “no” on reparationhe would support the formation of a committee to study the issu“Of course I would sign it” Sanders said.But he also said that “real attention” needs to be paid to “the most distressed communities in America.”“We have got to use at least 10 percent of all federal funds to make sure that kids who need it get the education get the jobs get the environmental protection that they need” Sanders said. “We have to take on the racial disparities which exist in this country.”“This is not about kissing my ring or Al Sharpton the kingmaker this is about mainstreaming the question of racial divide in America.”— Al Sharpton at the National Action Network’s annual conference where 13 presidential candidates appeared this weeFormer Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference in Washington on Friday.

Jay Inslee on Wednesday; and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro on Thursday. All are scheduled to air at 10 p.m. ET.Speaking of town halls Fox News stirred a bit of controversy this week announcing that it will host a presidential town hall with democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vt. on April 15. Fox News’ Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum will moderate the one-hour event live from Bethlehem Pa. beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET.“WTF is Bernie doing?” asked Ian Millhiser a columnist with the liberal news site ThinkProgress. Well for one thing Bernie’s doing exactly what he did in 2016 when he appeared alongside Hillary Clinton at a Fox News town hall. And the Democratic National Committee which announced that Fox will not host any of its 2020 debates gave Bernie its blessing.“While the DNC does not believe that FOX is equipped to be a partner for a 2020 debate because of concerns of fairness at the highest levels within their organization the DNC believes that we must reach all voters including their audience”a DNC spokesperson said in a statemen. “Therefore candidates should do what they need to do in order to engage these voters directly.”“It is important to distinguish Fox News from the many millions of people who watch Fox News. And I think it is important to talk to those people and say ‘You know what? I know that many of you voted for Donald Trump but he lied to you.’”— Bernie Sanders on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah”Pete Buttigieg speaks at the National Action Network conference in New York City on Thursday.

Kamala Harris raised $12 million for the quarter and Pete Buttigieg the Democratic mayor of South Bend Ind. boasted just over $7 million in donations for his presidential bid.The 12 other Democrats who have announced their candidacies have yet to release first-quarter totals but in the 24-hour period following their entry into the race former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke bested Sanders with an impressive $6.1 million haul. Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Gov. John Hickenlooper both said their campaigns took in one-day donations of $1 million.Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio announced his 2020 bid on ABC’s “The View” on Thursday. Rep. Eric Swalwell D-Calif. is expected to do the same on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on CBS next week.

However when pressed by the Rev.

Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas.After offering some support for Jackson Lee’s reparations bill Sanders qualified his position.Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at the 2019 National Action Network National convention in Manhattan on Friday. (Photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters)“There needs to be a study but let me also say this that I think that what we need to do … is to pay real attention to the most distressed communities in America” he said. “We have got to use 10 percent of all federal funds to make sure that kids who need it get the education get the jobs get the environmental protection that they need. And that would be a major focus of my efforts.”about the possibility of reparations Sanders has similarly said he prefers aid focused on “distressed” communities. In a March 1 appearance on “The View” Sanders said he wanted to “pay attention to distressed communities: black communities Latino communities and white communities.”“I think that right now our job is to address the crises facing the American people and our communities and I think there are better ways to do that than just writing out a check” Sanders added.Reparations have emerged as a major question for the candidates in this early phase of the Democratic primary. Other candidates notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris have expressed support for forms of aid that would be disproportionately directed toward the black community.While Sanders only shifted somewhat from his previous rejection of reparations at the National Action Network convention he did express support for other positions that are priorities for Sharpton and other black activists. In addition to asking about Jackson Lee’s reparations legislation Sharpton’s second question for the candidates was whether they would return to former President Barack Obama’s policy of using consent decrees — court approved agreements between federal and local governments on reforms — and federal funding to push for changes at police departments found to have engaged in abusive behavior. Sanders said he supported these positions and that his White House would have “zero tolerance for police brutality.”Sanders also called for “automatic voter registration” to address concerns about voting rights and emphasized his own history of civil rights activism including protesting housing discrimination and marching with Martin Luther King Jr. in the ’60s.“I am the son of an immigrant whose family was murdered by the Nazis” Sanders said. “So from a very young age I knew that we must stand up to bigotry wherever and whenever it exists.”Read more from Yahoo News:Seven women have now accused Joe Biden of inappropriate touchinBiden vows to keep pace with the changing boundaries of 'personal space’Pelosi: Biden’s behavior with women should not be ‘disqualifying’Woman in viral shoulder-hug photo defends BideDid Joe Biden miss his moment?S&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaBret Easton Ellis Wants 'Absolute Fools' in Media to Apologize for Mueller Report CoveragSenator Cory Booker Says He's Raised $5 Million For His 2020 Presidential BiSaturday Night Live Brings Back a Folksy and Handsy Joe BideHow the worst earnings season in years could trip up the stock markeAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Gaza animals find new home following deaths at zoChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesBeto O'Rourke Calls Benjamin Netanyahu A 'Racist' Says U.S.-Israel Relationship Must 'Transcend' Hi,1

Andrew Yang has a plan for that. Hate robocalls? Andrew Yang would fine companies that make them. Need marriage counseling? Andrew Yang says all our health plans should pay for family counseling.The entrepreneur turned 2020 Democratic presidential candidate has thought through issues big and small and because he has crossed the 65000 individual donor threshold to participate in the Democratic debates we’ll likely be hearing more about his ideas in the next year.“The American people are very smart and they realize there are genuine problems that got Donald Trump elected and that we’re in the midst of this incredible economic transformation and no one’s talking about it” says Yang. “I think that’s why my campaign has caught fire the last couple weeks.”When we sat down with Yang his donor list had expanded to 80000 donors albeit small donors who he jokes “are cheaper than Bernie’s.” (Donors to Sen. Bernie Sanders’s campaign the day he announced in 2016 gave an average of $27. Yang’s average donor gives $19.) Although he is barely registering support or name recognition in early polls he’s garnering buzz on social media where fans show support under #YangGang.The 44-year old Yang was born in Schenectady N.Y. the son of Taiwanese immigrants. His father was a researcher at IBM his mother a systems administrator at a local university. A product of the prep school and Ivy League pipeline Yang briefly practiced law before becoming an entrepreneur. After launching a few startups with mixed success Yang founded the nonprofit Venture for America a fellowship program to place recent college graduates at startups and help them launch their own businesses. A self-described nerd who asks what better foil is there to Trump than “an Asian man who’s good at math” Yang has done his homework. He rattles off numbers hard data and statistical projections to enforce his policy positions which are copious to say the least.Yang2020’s website lists more than 80 policy positions including boilerplate stances in line with mainstream Democrats on “Medicare for All” gun control and criminal justice reform. His more obscure stances include setting up a robocall complaint hotline that could lead to FCC fines and a plan to tackle divorce rates by mandating that health insurers provide family counseling in their plans. Yang may be asking the right questions but some of his proposed solutions seem like candidacy killers — politically nonviable and niche.Take for example one of the ways Yang would address climate change if he were in the White House. While he is in favor of a carbon tax plan that has been floated by moderate Democrats and Republicans he also supports a highly controversial approach to lowering the earth’s temperature through direct technical means known as geoengineering.According to the Union of Concerned Scientists geoengineering or climate engineering involves the “intentional large-scale intervention in the Earth’s climate system to counter climate change.” The term encompasses more benign and agreed-upon technologies such as carbon capture and low-tech solutions such as planting trees but also concepts like solar radiation management which could extend to placing mirrors in space to reflect the sun’s radiation away from earth or setting off volcanic eruptions to spread sun-reflecting aerosols into the stratosphere. Critics including the Union of Concerned Scientists say these unproven technologies could interfere with natural systems with unforeseen consequences and run the risk of setting off geopolitical conflicts. Yang argues the conventional proposals to solve climate change are too incremental.“We have to face facts that we are in all likelihood going to be facing a warming planet rising sea levels different weather patterns and we need to start thinking bigger about how we’re going to mitigate these effects” says Yang. “We’re messing with Mother Nature right now … in a catastrophic fashion and we have to at least explore what we have to do to blunt the worst effects for our civilization.”Yang’s plans to tackle climate change aren’t his only ideas far outside the box. He is reviving a 1970s-era concept that would guarantee every American monthly income from the federal government repackaging it as a solution to job losses from automation and artificial intelligence.As with climate change Yang’s signature economic policy — a Universal Basic Income — assumes that the world is already on a trajectory toward the most devastating outcomes. Many economists are warning that superintelligent computers will displace millions of workers by 2030 but Yang’s view is even more dire. He believes for example that the current generation of self-driving technology could replace millions of truck drivers in the next five to 10 years which would lead to “epic levels of distress displacement and even violence.”In 10 trips each to Iowa and New Hampshire Yang is targeting voters who would be most affected by automation working-class Americans without college degrees offering them a seemingly far-fetched promise. If they make him president he will give every American over the age of 18 a check for $1000 a month no strings attached. The monthly income would ease the transition to joblessness but the impact would be wider he says — addressing problems as broad as the mental health epidemic the education gap and persistent poverty and as specific as helping battered women escape abusive spouses and compensating people who drop out of the workforce to take care of children or elderly relatives.“People realize there’s nothing stopping the members of a democracy from voting ourselves a dividend” says Yang. “We’re the richest and most advanced economy in the history of the world. Our economy is about $20 trillion. We can easily afford a dividend of a thousand dollars per American.”He would pay for the massive $3 trillion program in part with a value-added tax on tech companies but balancing a Yang budget also requires optimism that a monthly paycheck for every American would be a massive economic stimulus — leading to job creation more spending and eventually increased tax revenue. He also believes the stipend would lower government bills for things like homelessness emergency room visits and incarceration. (Watch video for more details of Yang’s UBI plan)As hawkish as Yang is on the imminent dangers of automation he is a foreign-policy dove and his Asian-American identity seems to play into his nuanced view on the Trump administration’s increasingly antagonistic relationship with China in the competition for cyber superiority. During a talk to members of the Asian-American community earlier this year Yang made an astounding assertion about the potential fallout from confrontation with China: “We’re probably one generation from Americans shooting up a bunch of Asians saying ‘damn the Chinese’ because there’s a giant cold war with China. That’s the great danger I fear my children are going to grow up in.”Yang clarified his remarks in his Yahoo News interview saying they were meant to motivate Asian-Americans who have been “politically disengaged.” However the comments are consistent with Yang’s view that U.S. politicians are intentionally framing China as an antagonist when it should be seen as a potential collaborator on big issues that cross national boundaries including AI and climate change.While he acknowledges that China’s pirating of intellectual property is costing U.S. businesses billions of dollars and must be resolved he refutes “the traditional American lens [that] has been if someone is rising we must be falling.”“The goal is not always to be ahead of China” says Yang. “The goal is to be strong enough so that we can maintain a cooperative relationship with China as one of the leaders.”Yang’s worldview is at once fearful and optimistic. His policies are underpinned with an anxiety about present realities and a future when an explosion of AI-equipped automatons will deepen all the divisions in American society. In his mind the election of Donald Trump was the beginning of the pitchfork-and-torch scenario — and his vision as well as his presidential candidacy is intended to head off the mobs at the pass.Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes in Off-the-Rails Meghan McCain-Joy Behar Battle Over ImmigratioThey Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Kim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Prosecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock'Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesGaza animals find new home following deaths at zo,1
window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');Joe Trippi on Democrats in 2020: 'We Could Blow This'Democratic adviser on 2020: 'We could blow this'Joe Trippi (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photo: Charles Sykes/Invision/AP)Joe Trippi is mostly confident that Democrats will do the right thing in 2020.He’s not overly worried that the massive field — heade— will mix with a proportional primary and a restless grassroots to spark a civil war in the party that extends all the way through their convention. The 62-year old Democratic consultant believes his party will produce a nominee to run against President Trump on a hopeful uniting message.But he allowed “We could blow this.”“We’re a party that’s totally capable of making the path easier for [Trump] particularly if we fall into the traps he tends to set” Trippi said in an interview on the Yahoo News podcastBut Trippi said he thinks two things will keep Democrats away from a fractious internal battle. Primary voters he said will be pragmatic and clear-eyed because of how badly they want to beat Trump. And second the field will naturally get smaller after the first few primaries. Trippi said even some Democratic campaigns are underestimating the way the Iowa caucuses will cull the field by starving many candidates of attention and resources as media coverage zooms in on a handful of frontrunners.“I know what the rumble is out of that place” Tripp said of Iowa. “Some of these people think ‘Hey I can take fifth in Iowa but I’ll still be around. ... My first win might be in South Carolina.’”“I think a lot of these teams are underestimating just how strong the impulse will be” among the media and voters to cut the field down after Iowa and New Hampshire the second primary contest he said. “It’s kind of a law of gravity. The press and all of us cannot follow 18 people. ... We can’t do it.”Trippi 62 rose to fame in the Democratic Party in 2004 when he took Vermont Gov. Howard Dean from renegade to frontrunner status in that year’s presidential primary until Dean screamed his way out of the race after losing in Iowa. Most recently he was a senior adviser to Sen. Doug Jones during his shocking 2017 win in Alabama becoming the first Democratic senator from the state in 20 years.Trippi has worked in some capacity usually as a senior adviser on six of the last 10 presidential campaigns going back to his first in 1980.During the Jones campaign Trippi said he saw that “there were three groups in the Republican Party that are seriously considering voting for a Democrat for the first time in their life” — suburban women younger voters and the college educated.Because of that openness Trippi said he thinks the Democratic nominee in 2020 can take cues fromin Alabama. “I do not think this is ideological I think it's tone” Trippi said.“In other words there was something about Doug Jones tone that wasn't angry wasn't ‘You guys don't get what I'm talking about so it's my way or the highway’” Trippi said. “Also it’s ‘Hey we need to start listening to each other and find some common ground.’”If the Democratic nominee gets into a “mud fight” with Trump a contest of “who can be angrier and who can be meaner and who can be tougher on the other side” Trippi said then traditional Republican voters who might detest Trump will likely revert to their tribal identity.But Trippi said he “definitely” thinks Democrats will nominate a more positive candidate who strikes a welcoming tone to all voters.“Every cycle starts out where the purity on the left and the idealism tends to take hold and those players always do very well in the beginning and then as we start moving closer to the vote to actual votes being cast in Iowa New Hampshire Super Tuesday and beyond there's a certain pragmatism in our party that starts to take hold particularly in years where there's a Republican president seeking reelection” he said.Accordingly Trippi didn’t sound too impressed with former Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s candidacy. “He's interesting but I think in the end I don't see —” Trippi stopped himself from going too far and changed directions. “It's way too early to know whether they're connecting beyond their initial surge right? One of the things I think that people don't realize is how easy it is to raise 10 million dollars now” Trippi said referring to O’Rourke’sduring his first three weeks as a candidate.On Sen. Bernie Sanders Trippi was more circumspect. “Not that Bernie's a divider I just think his style ... has some anger in it” Trippi said. “If he can somehow be more of a happy warrior I mean a warrior but sort of a happier warrior … I think there's a little bit of the angry guy ... saying ‘Get off my lawn’ that hurts him in that fight. I think he's doing better at that. I do. I think he's doing better.”There is one person Trippi said many were underestimating. “There are a lot of people discounting [former vice president] Joe Biden when they shouldn't be” he said. He then added: “There are a lot of people discounting Beto or Bernie Sanders when they shouldn't be.”But Trippi went into detail on how a Biden candidacy would change the dynamics of the race. “The minute Joe Biden gets in the race he's got 100 press people covering him” he said. “That means every day there's coverage of that. ... Who else gets that? Does Bernie get it? Maybe. Does Beto get it? Maybe. Does [Sen. Kamala] Harris get it?”“I'm not sure [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren does now” he said of that scenario.The one thing Trippi was certain of? That the next 12 to 18 months is going to be a wild ride.“I do think none of the candidates — save Bernie and Biden if he gets in — have a clue what they've gotten themselves into and I think that most of their teams don't know what they've gotten themselves into because we don't have 18 national campaign managers” Trippi said. “They will after this.”Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaA Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes Add to Supply Concern9 Things You Must Know About CBD Before Investing in Pot StockAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in Ugand,1

(Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP (2) Getty Images)GLENDALE Calif. — On Tuesday evening Tom Steyer the Democratic megadonor turned impeachment activist brought his anti-Donald Trump road show to the MGM Banquet Hall a small windowless wedding venue with $10 valet parking in the suburbs of Los Angeles.At first glance Steyer’s town hall seemed indistinguishable from the 50 others he has staged across the country since launching Need to Impeach in October 2017. (He’s spent $50 million on the effort.) The sign-up sheets in the lobby. The introductory video compilation of Steyer’s many cable-news hits. The inner-city choir as a warm-up act. Even the location in the district of an influential congressional Democrat — in this case House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.And yet this time something was different.Each of Steyer’s previous events had been held while America waited to see whether special counsel Robert Mueller’s report would decisively prove thathad committed an impeachable offense.Back then impeachment seemed like a live possibility depending on what sort of wrongdoing prosecutors uncovered.The Glendale event however was the first to take place in the confusing initial aftermath of Mueller’s investigation. Trump has been publicly cleared of criminal conspiracy with Russia; leading Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi havepretty much ruled out the idea of Congress attempting to remove the president from offic. But at the same time reports are surfacing thatthe full still-unreleased Mueller report may be more much damaging to Trumthan Attorney General William Barr’s initial summary let on particularly on the question of whether the president tried to obstruct justice.Tom Steyer speaks at the Need to Impeach town hall in Glendale Calif. on Tuesday. (Photo: Andrew Romano/Yahoo News)As such Tuesday’s gathering provided perhaps the clearest glimpse yet into the bewildered psyche of the pro-impeachment left as it struggles to comprehend the disorientingdenouement of Mueller’s nearly two-year probe — and to figure out a way forward.“Did we drink the Kool-Aid about Mueller?” Need to Impeach volunteer Sandi Tang asked Steyer her voice trembling with emotion. “I didn’t know much about him and I thought ‘Oh my God he’s our saving grace.’ We f***ing saw [Trump] do all this s*** in front of our own eyes! So how did Mueller — this guy we thought was going to tell us the truth — spend millions of dollars and 2 1/2 years and not come up with the things that we all saw much less all the other stuff we heard about?”From the start the event felt more like a group therapy session than a traditional town hall with Steyer dressed in black slacks a blue shirt and a technicolor belt playing the part of political therapist.“This is the most corrupt president in American history” Steyer reassured his followers. “We know that. Everyone knows that.”But the crowd of mostly middle-aged MSNBC types already seemed to be cycling through the. Denial was perhaps the most prevalent.“I’m going to say this a little less eloquently than Tom Steyer” quipped Steyer’s co-host progressive radio personality. “But we still need to“He was impeachable on Inauguration Day!” shouted a bald man in a gray hoodie.Nearby a woman in a blue T-shirt and ponytail waved a sign that read “Indict. Impeach. Imprison. Lock them up.”An attendee at Tom Steyer's Need to Impeach town hall on Tuesday. (Photo: Andrew Romano/Yahoo News)Others cited Mueller’s partisan affiliation to question whether his report could be trusted at all.“We’ve all been convinced that Mr. Mueller was going to do right by our nation” said Krisna Velasco the correspondence secretary for California’s Chicano Latino Caucus. “But what we’re forgetting is that he is a Republican. We’ve all watched a lot of Republicans that we admire justand stand by Trump’s side. What makes us think Mueller hasn’t done the same?”Anger also surfaced at regular intervals. When a gray-haired senior citizen started her question by saying “We all know that to impeach there has to be a crime” she was immediately interrupted by a fellow audience member.!” the other person yelled from across the hall impatiently correcting her interpretation ofArticle II Section 4 of the U.S. ConstitutioSteyer went on to tell the questioner that in his opinion it was “clear that [Trump] obstructed justice” by firing “the person running the investigation” FBI Director James Comey even thoughMueller did not come to a conclusion on the issuYet obstruction wasn’t enough for the crowd which began to howl about Trump’s other alleged crimes.He cheated on his taxeHe cheated on his wif!” snapped a woman near the front. “It’s true.”The simmering tensions soon boiled over when a young woman wearing a “Latinos for Trump” T-shirt stood up and unfurled a Trump 2020 banner.“I am Hispanic I am an immigrant and I support Trump” declaredJazmina Saavedra a local pro-Trump activis“He puts the American people first!” Saavedra snapped. “Instead of illegals!”“He violates the Constitution!” someone responded. “You must not know your Constitution.”Anger surfaced at regular intervals during Tuesday's Need to Impeach town hall in Glendale Calif. (Photo: Andrew Romano/Yahoo News)Throughout Steyer worked to soothe his anxious audience. “Everybody gets to make their point” he said as the crowd tried to drown out Saavedra’s #MAGA slogans; later he descended from the stage to give her a hug then tried to transform her provocation into a teachable moment.“Are we going to accept each other as full human beings or not?” he asked. “If we think we can only get ahead by vilifying other people that will be the end of the United States.”But some attendees still seemed to be veering toward the “bargaining” stage of grief — or even “depression.” Sandi Tang wondered aloud whether Steyer &amp; Co. were making a mistake by continuing to contradict Pelosi who has called Steyer’s impeachment efforts“a waste of time and mone“Your movement is not in line with the head of the Democratic Party” Tang said. “And I’m quite concerned about that.”In response Steyer unveiled his main post-Mueller argument:It was a message he would repeat throughout the night. In 2018 Steyer said Pelosi and other Democrats had a “sense of concern” that by pushing impeachment “we were going to invigorate turnout by Republicans and that would enable them to hold on to the House. But Steyer argued “I have never wondered about whether this movement was going to help Democrats to win. I know it is.”And so he continued pro-impeachment progressives have to stay the course. After all America still hasn’t seen the full Mueller report — only a short summary by Barr Trump’s handpicked attorney general. (Barr has pledged to release a redacted version of the report sometime this month; the House Judiciary Committee hasChairman Jerry Nadler to issue a subpoena for the full report.Whenever the Mueller report finally comes out “there will be good evidence in there” Steyer said; it may even convince the country that Trump tried to obstruct justice. But Steyer added “we already have enough evidence” even without Mueller’s findings — namely the eight other impeachable offensesfrom “profiting from the Presidency” to “violating campaign finance laws.”“We’ve had one hearing on this” Steyer concluded. “We should be having dozens of those hearings so Americans can see who these people are. I don’t think it matters whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent. When we see this kind of criminality ... that will give Americans a chance to make up our own minds about what’s right and wrong.”In other words despite the political tides that are turning against it — despite increasing skepticism among congressional Democrats and increasing triumphalism among congressional Republicans— the dream of impeachment is not dead. Not yet. There’s still hope. There’s still time.The crowd cheered. It was exactly what they came to hear.A supporter of the Need to Impeach movement at the town hall in Glendale Calif. on Tuesday.

Chuck Grassley R-Iowa blasted the president’s claims in a Wednesday call with reporters.“I’m told that the White House respects my views on a lot of issues” Grassley said adding that Trump’s “comments on wind energy — not only as a president but when he was a candidate — were first of all idiotic and it didn’t show much respect for Chuck Grassley as the grandfather of the wind energy tax credit.”Donald Trump and a wind farm. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP Getty Images)House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Grassley’s characterization.“The president is saying that wind power is causing cancer” Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday. “I associate myself with the remarks of Chairman Grassley. It’s an idiotic statement.”On Wednesday Grassley joined a bipartisan group of 19 senators in signing a letter pushing “to ensure American remains a leader in wind energy technology.”There is no scientific evidence to support Trump’s claim that the noise from wind turbines is correlated with or causes cancer. Asked Wednesday whether Americans should be worried about such a risk White House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp was unable to explain the president’s remarks.“I don’t have an answer to that” Schlapp replied.Connecting the noise from wind power turbines with cancer wasn’t the only dubious claim the president made Tuesday about the alternative energy source.“If you have a windmill anywhere near your house congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value” Trump said.In February Trump lost a court case against the government of Scotland over the billionaire’s battle to halt construction of an 11-turbine wind farm offshore from his Aberdeen golf resort. The club must now reimburse the Scottish government for legal costs.Financial disclosure forms show however that while Trump’s quixotic fight against the windmills will cost him millions in legal fees his golf propertyAt an October rally in Ohio Trump also claimed that a downside of wind power was that electrical service stops when the breeze dies.“When the wind doesn’t blow just turn off the television darling please.

Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated.”In its report the Times cited “government officials and others familiar with their simmering frustrations.”From the start of thein May 2017 until its report was submitted to Barr in March there were virtually no reports of leaks or official comments to the public from the special counsel’s office. The Times story if borne out would represent the first significant crack in that wall.President Trump speaks at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner in Washington D.C. on Tuesday. (Photo: Joshua Roberts/Reuters)“The New York Times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the Mueller Report”. “In fact they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!”“False” the tweet read. “Our reporters interviewed multiple government officials and others to gather the facts for the story.”And other media outlets supported the Times reporting.According to the Washington Pos investigators are “frustrated with the limited information Attorney General William P. Barr has provided about their nearly two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump sought to obstruct justice.”that the evidence that Trump “sought to impede the investigation is stronger than Barr suggested in his March letter.”Attorney General William Barr says his office is working with special counsel Robert Mueller to make the “redactions that are required” before releasing the report.

Barr concluded there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.The special counsel also stated that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime it also does not exonerate him” according to Barr’s letter.Nonetheless Trump and his supporters haveused Barr’s letter as vindication for the presiden while Democrats and even several key Republicans in Congress — including influential Sen. Chuck Grassley — are calling for the full release of Mueller’s report.I support release of the Mueller reporAhead of the conclusion of the Russia investigation the House voted 420-0 on March 14 to demand that the Justice Department publicly release the full findings of the special counsel’s report.

(Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)MIAMI — The generational divide among white evangelicals over issues of race and social justice has given the group a more conservative reputation than is merited but that will change in the coming decade according to the head of an influential Christian aid group.Speaking with a group of journalists here this week Gary Haugen founder and CEO of the International Justice Mission (IJM) which mostly works outside the United States also addressed questions about what insights he might have about injustice in America.Haugen avoided commenting directly on issues of racial injustice or on the question of why white evangelical Christians have been stalwart supporters of who rose to power by demonizing immigrants. But Haugen stood by his assertion years ago before the rise of Trump that there is a “sea change” among evangelicals as it relates to issues of injustice. However he qualified that much of this change is not yet being seen among older white evangelicals.In particular Haugen pinpointed the world of conservative philanthropy which intersects closely with nonprofit and aid work. The tension he intimated is between a money sector in evangelicalism dominated by wealthy individuals who skew older and much more conservative in their politics and an activist sector that is younger and far more progressive in its worldview.Among aid and reform groups like his “if you aren’t actually talking about justice you’re probably not credible” Haugen said at the Faith Angle Forum a conference sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center.“[But] those folks do not hold the money and the power in that church community right now” he said. “But in 15 years they will. I think you will see a different phenomenon.”Haugen 56 worked early in his career for Bishop Desmond Tutu’s National Initiative for Reconciliation in South Africa then directed the United Nations’ investigation into the Rwandan genocide and also investigated police abuse cases for the Justice Department in the 1990s during Bill Clinton’s presidency. He started IJM in 1997 and the group has grown now to have an endowment of around $50 million.Speaking at the same event columnist Michael Gerson a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush said Haugen was the kind of Christian who “makes the term evangelical worth fighting for.” Haugen followed up by saying he “may not be willing to fight for the word evangelical” himself.The term he said has come to represent a set of political beliefs rather than theological commitments.But speaking to journalists Haugen argued that conservative Christians’ focus on the kind of international aid work his group does is not at odds with an emphasis on injustice in the United States. It’s possible he said to care about fighting sex trafficking in Third-World countries without it distracting from the problem of mass incarceration or police brutality here in the U.S.Nonetheless some younger Christians and people of color in the faith community are suspicious that the focus on international aid among white conservatives is a way to avoid more difficult issues of racial injustice at home.At a conference in Dallas last weekenda leader from IJM was “welcomed with thunderous applause” according topublished Tuesday by DeeDee Roe an African-American freelance writer from Dallas who attended.“She spoke passionately about the work of IJM confronting perpetrators of police brutality in Kenya. The audience made tearful commitments to partner in her work tears I knew did not extend to Black victims of police brutality in this nation” Roe wrote.Roe went on to describe her observations of a hostile reaction from some white attendees to a different speaker Ekemini Uwan a prominent author and speaker. Uwan criticized the idea of “whiteness” as “rooted in plunder theft enslavement of Africans and the genocide of Native Americans.”“Whiteness is a power structure. The thing for white women to do here is divest from whiteness” Uwan said according to Roe’s account. She described seeing some white attendees walking out as Uwan spoke.Sparrow Conference which organized the event did not respond to Yahoo News’ request for comment.Haugen acknowledged that white evangelicals’ interest in international aid may not always translate into a commitment to fighting poverty and injustice in their own neighborhoods.“How it actually works out in your community the overwhelming problem is going to be what your fears are” he said. “These lids always tend to get put back on because people get scared of things.”Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes in Off-the-Rails Meghan McCain-Joy Behar Battle Over ImmigratioThey Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Kim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandUS economy will hit 3% growth this year: First Trust Advisors' Brian WesburAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Gabrielle Union cheers on Dwyane Wade's son at gay pride paradPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesMy Mom Selected All the Gifts in This Mother's Day Gift Guid,1

J. Hill at a fundraising event in Minneapolis.On Wednesday after Biden pledged to be “more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space” three more women accused him of inappropriate behavior as reported by. Vail Kohnert-Yount was a White House intern when she said Biden introduced himself to her in the basement of the West Wing and “put his hand on the back of my head and pressed his forehead to my forehead while he talked to me.”Former Vice President Joe Biden speaks on Dec. 13 2018 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. (Photo: Rick Bowmer/AP)Kohnert-Yount in a statement said “I was so shocked that it was hard to focus on what he was saying. I remember he told me I was a ‘pretty girl.’”Sofie Karasek met Biden at the Oscars along with a group of 50 sexual assault victims who appeared onstage with Lady Gaga. Karasek said that after the ceremony she decided to share with Biden who introduced Gaga’s performance a story about a college student who’d committed suicide after being sexually assaulted and as reported by the Washington Post “Biden responded by clasping her hands and leaning down to place his forehead against hers.”The third women Ally Coll was a Democratic staffer working at a reception when she was introduced to Biden who she said “leaned in squeezed her shoulders and delivered a compliment about her smile holding her ‘for a beat too long’” the Washington Post reported.No men have come forward but all of the women have said Biden’s unwanted behavior wasn’t sexual but made them uncomfortable.“Social norms have begun to change” Biden said in his video response. “They’ve shifted and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it.”the 2020 Democratic pack in polls though he hasn’t officially announced his bid. He was expected to announce his run later this month.After Flores suggested Biden be disqualified from running for president a number of women came to his defense including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.“He has to understand in the world that we’re in now that people’s space is important to them” sheTuesday “and what’s important is how they receive it and not necessarily how you intended it.”“I've always tried to make a human connection” Biden said in his video. “That’s my responsibility I think. I shake hands I hug people. I grab men and women by the shoulders and say ‘You can do this.’ And whether they’re women men young old it’s the way I’ve always been.”“It’s the way I've tried to show I care about them and I’m listening” he added.After Biden’s response actress and #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano who rallied against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he was accused of sexual assaulther support for Biden writing “My friend Joe Biden” along with his video statement.Joe Biden “is not a pervert or sexual harasser”Ana Navarro-Cárdenas conservative co-host of “The View.” “Good he put out this video.

A stark contrast to another who occupies high office in our nation.”In an effort to explain his actions Biden in his video referenced personal tragedies he had suffered like the loss of his first wife and baby daughter in a 1972 car crash and the death of his adult son Beau to brain cancer in 2015.“Over the years knowing what I’ve been through the things that I’ve faced I found that scores if not hundreds of people come up to me and reached out for solace and comfort something anything that may help them get through the tragedy they’re going through. And so it’s just who I am.”said “not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately” repeated that he is listening but defended his way of “connecting with people.”“I hear what they’re saying I understand it” he said. “But I’ll always believe governing quite frankly — life for that matter — is about connecting about connecting with people. That won’t change but I will be more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space. And that’s a good thing.”The accusations have not only led to questions of Biden’s fitness to lead a progressive Democratic Party into 2020 but also gave legs to claims that the 76-year-old isof the #MeToo movement — an accusation Biden rejected.“I’ve worked my whole life to empower women” said Biden.” I’ve worked my whole life to prevent abuse.

While most in attendance were already members of Siembra (which means “sowing” as in seeds) about eight stood up at the start of the meeting to identify themselves as first-timers.ICE’s increasingly aggressive actions over the last two years have been met with this form of nonviolent resistance from grassroots groups like Siembra which has established itself among the communities of North Carolina’s Alamance Randolph Forsythe and Guilford counties. In addition to efforts to organize and educate undocumented residents on the ways they can protect themselves and their neighbors against ICE Siembra also is urging sheriffs in these counties to follow the example of their newly elected counterparts in the nearby counties of Mecklenburg Wake and Durham who have ended long-standing agreements to cooperate with ICE by among other things holding undocumented immigrants in local jails on the agency’s behalf.Andrew Willis Garces director of organizing and communications for Siembra NC speaks to members of the grassroots group at a meeting in Greensboro N.C. (Photo: Caitlin Dickson/Yahoo News)Though popular in the communities these moves prompted a backlash from federal immigration officials who say they were forced to step up enforcement including a four-day operation in February that resulted in the detention of 200 undocumented immigrants from across North Carolina. Sean Gallagher director of ICE’s Atlanta field office said the February raids were necessitated by some sheriffs’ “dangerous policies” and warned that those counties should expect increased ICE presence as the “new normal.”Gallagher’s comments reflect a national trend toward large-scale enforcement operations by ICE over the last two years especially in localities with so-called sanctuary policies that prohibit or discourage local law enforcement agencies from certain forms of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.Although Gallagher whose office covers Georgia and the Carolinas singled out counties where sheriffs were declining to cooperate with ICE the agency has been conducting large-scale enforcement operations across the state. The February raids had a chilling effect on North Carolina’s immigrant communities bringing normal life to a virtual halt for days. As families scrambled to locate relatives who they discovered had been moved to an ICE detention facility in Georgia — many parents kept their. Then in the days and weeks that followed amid a dizzying swirl of rumors and factual reports of additional arrests in other parts of the state many continued to stay indoors seldom leaving home except for school or work. Activities like shopping and eating out were now viewed as dangerous. Social gatherings suddenly seemed risky causing some to cancel even major events such as baby showers or quinceañeras the traditional Latin American celebration of a girl’s 15th birthday. Businesses suffered.Immigrants and their supporters protest recent arrests conducted by ICE in the Charlotte N.C. area. (Photo: Jeff Siner/Charlotte Observer)“It paralyzes us” said one woman at the Siembra meeting as the conversation turned to the spread of rumors on Facebook about supposed ICE activity. Many in the group nodded in agreement as she and others described hours of self-imposed house arrest because of an unsubstantiated Facebook post claiming ICE agents had been spotted in the parking lot of a Walmart or near a housing complex.“ICE I think has two forms of controlling us” another woman told the group. “One is through detentions which we are always thinking about but the other is [by scaring] the people.”Hence Siembra’s mission to provide reliable information about ICE tactics helping immigrants reclaim some control over their own lives sending volunteers door to door in their own neighborhoods handing out information about ICE immigrants’ legal rights and how to report suspected ICE activity to a 24-hour hotline. An unfamiliar car with tinted windows parked at the entry to a trailer park whose residents are largely undocumented might prompt a tip. Trained volunteer “verifiers” are then dispatched to ascertain if ICE is conducting an operation.If ICE activity is confirmed Siembra spreads the word on one of its 10 or so WhatsApp groups organized by zip code with hundreds of people in each warning them to be cautious about going outdoors. Siembra verifiers stream real-time interactions with ICE agents on Facebook Live using the platform to remind viewers of their rights.We want people to feel empowered and powerful not anxious and afraid. and that they can train other people on that same thing and think We are not just resilient but we are powerful” said Willis Garces.During the first week of February Willis Garces said “we got 680 phone calls in a 5-day period.” In a typical week he estimated that the hotline receives between two and 12 calls per day the majority of which appear to be false alarms.For anyone residing in the country illegally the fear of deportation is a constant that predates President Trump and will continue after he’s left office. The president with theduring his administration was Barack Obama. But while his administration targeted specific categories of undocumented immigrants prioritizing criminals and repeat border crossers particularly during its last two years the current administration’s approach to interior immigration enforcement seems less defined by specific policies than by aggressive wide-ranging and seemingly indiscriminate roundups.President Trump addressing an immigration event at the White House last year. (Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)Perhaps one of the best indications of the agency’s approach to interior enforcement under Trump came fromthen Acting ICE Director Thomas Homaduring a June 2017 appearance before the House appropriations subcommittee in which he spelled out the implications of then Secretary of the Department of Homeland Services John Kelly’sofficially dismantling the enforcement priority categories established under President Obama. Homan said the agency would still prioritize deportation for national security threats convicted criminals people caught reentering the country illegally after previous deportation and those with final orders of removal. But he said “If you’re in this country illegally and you committed a crime by being in this country you should be uncomfortable you should look over your shoulder. “You need to be worried. No population is off the table.”Across the country ICE arrests of immigrants without criminal convictions have skyrocketed under President Trump more than tripling during the first 14 months of his presidency according to ICE data initially reported byAmong the ways the Trump administration has sought to carry out this general mission including multipleby former Attorney General Jeff Sessions tofrom sanctuary jurisdictions is by expanding its partnerships with local law enforcement agencies througha program known as 287(g).Garry McFadden made clear that this mission did not align with his during his campaign last fall for sheriff of Mecklenburg County which includes North Carolina’s most populous city Charlotte. Among the changes he promised was to end of the department’s participation in 287(g) under which sheriff’s deputies were required to run information on all inmates booked at the county jail through a federal database. If they appeared to be in the country illegally the sheriff’s office would notify ICE and continue to detain them for federal agents to take into custody.In his first official act as sheriff McFadden followed through on this campaign promise with a public celebration at Hispanic-owned Manola’s Bakery in Charlotte marking the end of the 287(g) era in Mecklenburg County.McFadden acknowledges he “made a statement” but the media-savvy sheriff easily recognizable in his tailored three-piece suit and designer shoes insists his position on ICE “isn’t about politics.”Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden prompted backlash from federal immigration officials by terminating a longstanding partnership between his office and ICE. (Photo: Caitlin Dickson/Yahoo News)Instead McFadden told Yahoo News the decision to terminate the program was based on his own 37 years of law enforcement experience including 22 spent as a homicide detective with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. Making his job even more difficult the widespread suspicion of law enforcement in some minority communities that made victims and witnesses reluctant to come forward was compounded by the fear of becoming entangled with ICE.“It was eroding trust” McFadden said of the program. “It creates an environment for violent criminals to operate freely in [immigrant] communities because they know victims are afraid” to call police or testify in court.“You are helping to breed violence because you are allowing these things to go unreported and people know that” he said. Under his new policy ICE is still notified when his office arrests someone who may be in the country illegally. Information about arrestees’ citizenship status or country of origin is automatically submitted to a federal database that ICE has always had access to regardless of a county’s participation in 287(g). But unless it receives a criminal arrest warrant for a specific person in custody McFadden’s office is no longer obligated to report that person directly to ICE or to continue holding him or her on ICE’s request for investigation of a possible immigration violation.Now sheriff’s deputies will no longer carry out ICE duties such as questioning inmates about their immigration status to determine if they are in the country illegally nor will an ICE agent be stationed inside the Mecklenburg County jail.“This is a voluntary agreement it’s not the law” McFadden said of 287(g) adding that he viewed the February raids as retaliatory. “They ask us to play with them and when you don’t play with them they become a bully.”In response to McFadden’s public breakup with ICE Gallagher the Atlanta field office director called the new sheriff’s action “an open invitation to aliens who commit criminal offenses that Mecklenburg County is now a safe haven for persons seeking to evade federal authorities.”In a statement to Yahoo News Bryan Cox spokesman for ICE’s southern region referred to that same comment as well as other warnings he and Gallagher both issued against McFadden’s pledge to end 287(g) in his election campaign. Claims of retaliation by ICE Cox said are “completely baseless as this agency was on record multiple times last year making clear in advance that should these policies be implemented ICE would have no choice but to reallocate its enforcement resources if no longer allowed access to the county jail and that such a policy would likely result in more persons being encountered by ICE not less.”A sign against 287(g) a controversial program which enlists local law enforcement officers to carry out certain federal immigration enforcement tasks on behalf of ICE. (Photo: Caitlin Dickson/Yahoo News)For McFadden ending 287(g) was simply a necessary step toward rebuilding trust between his office and the immigrant community.“I have to still protect these people documented or undocumented” said McFadden. “If an undocumented person is raped robbed or killed I can’t say ‘We don’t investigate that because they’re undocumented.’ So I have to build a relationship.”McFadden repeated this same message following a recent Sunday mass at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church eliciting resounding applause from some 500 people who filled every seat in the chapel stood against the walls and spilled out into the front entrance of the church lining up to shake hands take selfies and above all express their gratitude to the new sheriff.People [are] really really excited about his stance regarding ICE” said Father Hugo Medellin associate pastor at the church whose large congregation is made up mostly of Hispanic immigrants. “As soon as we mentioned he was coming the place was going to be completely overcrowded and it was going to be chaotic.”“We don’t know how to thank him” said Marlene Serafin Silva who volunteers in the kitchen at Our Lady of Guadalupe. “We feel more secure with him.”Silva was born in the capital of Mexico and has lived in the United States for 50 years half that time in Charlotte. She was one of the first people to approach McFadden following his recent unannounced appearance at the church and she stuck close to his side as the sheriff made his way from the chapel to the kitchen where he was greeted by more fans.Sheriff McFadden embraces Charlotte resident Marlene Serafin Silva after speaking at Sunday mass. (Photo: Caitlin Dickson/ Yahoo News)“The people are scared you know. That’s why we’re feeling good now” said Arevinar Cruz after he and his son 9-year-old Alex had their turn posing for a photo with McFadden. Cruz a native of El Salvador has lived in the U.S. for almost 19 years under the Temporary Protected Status program which permits foreign nationals of certain countries impacted by armed conflict or natural disasters to live and work in the United States for designated periods. He belongs to a local alliance of TPS holders seeking legal permanent residency. Though he said he has always trusted the police Cruz was excited about the prospect of scheduling an appointment with the sheriff to discuss his organization’s efforts — something he “never ever” imagined doing with any of McFadden’s predecessors.The recent ICE operations in North Carolina are not unique but reflective a number of larger national trends seen in similar sweeps targeting immigrant communities over the past two years — particularly in sanctuary cities like Chicago Los Angeles and New York.Unlike traditional worksite raids these community-based operations have been carried out through traffic stops and other seemingly random encounters with plainsclothes agents in unmarked cars. They’ve also been marked by notably high numbers of what ICE refers to as “collateral” or “at large” arrests of undocumented immigrants not actually targeted by ICE but as Gallagher put it during his press conference on the North Carolina raids were just “in the wrong place at the wrong time.”Collateral arrests of people encountered during targeted ICE operations are not new. However the sheer volume over the last two years comprising more than half the total number of people caught in some of these larger community sweeps have raised concerns among immigration advocates about who exactly ICE is targeting with these operations and the legality of their methodMost people ensnared by such “collateral” arrests do not have criminal records.Mark Fleming associate director of litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center described operations in which ICE is “literally going into Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago where they believed there would be undocumented immigrants and pulling people over with no basis to identify whether they were unlawfully in the U.S.”A demonstrator is arrested after Samuel Oliver-Bruno 47 an undocumented Mexican national was arrested after arriving at an appointment with immigration officials in Morrisville N.C. last year. (Photo: Travis Long/The News &amp; Observer via AP) accusing ICE of using “warrantless traffic stops and racial profiling among other tactics” to conduct more than 100 “collateral” arrests over the course of six days in Chicago — 68 percent of the total 156 people caught up in that particular operation.In the complaint initially filed on behalf of two longtime Chicago residents arrested in that sweep NIJC noted that language inannouncing results of the Chicago operation echoed those released following similar actions in Los Angeles New York Northern California and Philadelphia. Like Gallagher’s comments following the North Carolina raids (in which a third of the 200 arrests were deemed collateral) ICE’s press releases also seemed to blame those cities’ policies for forcing ICE to take its enforcement to the streets.ICE maintains that sanctuary laws or other policies that limit ICE’s ability to utilize local law enforcement resources are a threat to public safety. In reality Fleming argues such policies simply make it harder for ICE to apprehend a broad array of people.“The reality is they know they will have to use their resources only to go after people who have very serious crimes they don’t want to do that” said Fleming. “That piece is what ICE sees as undermining their mission which is to deport as many people who are here unlawfully as they possibly can.”Asked how racial profiling and other sorts of unlawful tactics can be avoided when conducting such large numbers of collateral or at-large arrests an ICE spokesperson told Yahoo News that “pursuant to longstanding policy… officers regularly assigned to conduct at-large law enforcement field operations complete Fourth Amendment training at a minimum every six months. In addition all [enforcement and removal operations] law enforcement officers assigned to participate in a nationwide law enforcement operation involving at-large targets complete Fourth Amendment training prior to participating in that operation.”The spokesperson also noted that recent statistics released by ICE show that collateral arrests have decreased during the first quarter of 2019 compared to the same time last year. However ICE does not attribute that drop to changes in its interior enforcement strategy but according to Nathalie Asher ICE’s acting executive associate director for enforcement and removal operation it is the result of shifting resources to respond to increased demand for detention of people arriving at the southwest border.Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers arrest more than 100 employees on federal immigration violations at a trailer manufacturing business in Sumner Texas last year. (Photo: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement/Handout via Reuters)Sheriffs like McFadden show no signs of giving in to pressure to cooperate with the agency. In fact days after the big February raids another newly elected sheriff Bobby Kimbrough of Forsyth County announced that he would terminate his office’s prior agreement to detain people suspected of being in the country illegally on ICE’s behalf at the county jail.“We will not be an extension of ICE doing roundups [and] immigrant investigations”at a news conference. Now Siembra is determined to get the new which includes Greensboro to follow suit.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanCasino-operating tribes influence sports betting debatFull Romney: Immigration is 'overwhelming our system'Immigration Judges Called Lawyers Dishonest Lazy and Useless Complaint Allege1st-timers Texas Tech and Virginia face off for NCAA titlRivals Camp Series Charlotte: Thoughts from the sidelinAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Pakistan says it has intelligence of new Indian attack this montChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesU.S. judge orders halt to Trump asylum seekers polic,1
"window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationCandidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationPresidential elections are decided by many things: media exposure financial backing personal chemistry timing and luck. Policy positions often are just a way of signaling where a candidate stands on the political spectrum. But 2020 is shaping up to be different the most ideas-driven election in recent American history. On the Democratic side a robust debate about inequality has given rise to ambitious proposals to redress the imbalance in Americans’ economic situation. Candidates are churning out positions on banking regulation antitrust law and the future effects of artificial intelligence. The Green New Deal is spurring debate on the crucial issue of climate change which could also play a role in a possible Republican challenge to Donald Trump.Yahoo News will be examining these and other policy questions in “The Ideas Election” — a series of articles on how candidates are defining and addressing the most important issues facing the United States as it prepares to enter a new decade.In the past few decades the racial wealth gap. African-Americans are incarcerated at more thanthe rate of whites. They die at athan white Americans. And their homeownership has reachedThese disparities can be traced back to centuries of slavery and subsequent generations of oppression under Jim Crow. And reparations repairing the harm done by slavery have been sporadically pitched for years as a way to acknowledge apologize and compensate descendants of slaves for past and continuing harms.“Compensation can be anything that helps people of African descent in this country build wealth” said Kamm Howard a co-chair of the National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America (NCOBRA). “It can be a check. It can be some type of tax relief. It can be business grants. It can be education grants. It can be anything to help us build wealth. But most people look at compensation as a personal check and we're not in disagreement with that.”Reparations advocates like Howard argue there’s enough evidence to prove the lasting effect of generational trauma on people like descendants of Jews who were victims of the Nazis. Or they cite the 2016 United Nationswhich found “the legacy of colonial history enslavement racial subordination and segregation racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge.”However reparations has been largely considered impractical. Not all people of color in the United States are descended from slaves and not all are impoverished. It’s also expensive and would cost the U.S. government $6 trillion to as much as. University of Connecticut professor Thomas Craemer arrived at that range by calculating the value of slave labor at prevailing wages from 1776 to 1865 compounded at 3 percent annually.Presidential candidates have offered up race-blind economic policies as feasible approaches to reparations. But “far-reaching programs that are nonracial programs” aren’t reparations said Howard.Toward the end of the Civil War the idea of compensation for black slaves emerged in 1865 when Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman issued an order granting freed slaves 40 acres of land along the southern coast. (The phrase “40 acres and a mule” would later come from this order.) But that promise was broken when after Abraham Lincoln’s assassination President Andrew Johnson reversed the order returning the land to its original owners.The idea of reparations resurfaced during the civil rights movement in a 1969 “” which in part demanded $500 million in reparations from white churches and synagogues “for Black enslavement and continuing discrimination and oppression.”In 1972 around the time of a presidential election civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson demanded a $900 million “freedom budget.” And when Jackson first ran for president in 1988 he made monetary reparations a part of his campaign platform.Still the idea has remained mostly on the margins of political discourse in America.But by 1989 when Rep. John Conyers D-Mich. first introduced a bill called the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act the idea of seeking financial redress from the government wasn’t considered so outlandish.Japanese-Americans had won reparations for forced internment by the U.S. government during World War II. That program was based on a report by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians. Backers of slave reparations say the same process should apply to their cause.Conyers’s bill H.R. 40 in homage to “40 acres and a mule” requested a commission to acknowledge and study the impact of slavery and of the economic social and political discrimination against descendants of enslaved Africans in America. Once the effects of slavery were legitimately established the commission would then make recommendations for repairing the harm done to living African-Americans.In order to claim reparations harm or injury has to be proven. Historians havethat reparations were at least owed to former slaves for property they should have received. But they also note that slavery alone may not account for the entire disparity in wealth between whites and African Americans which could also be the result of policies put in place after the end of Reconstruction.Over the next 28 years Conyers repeatedly introduced the reparations commission bill in the House where it received little bipartisan support.In public arena writers like Ta-Nehisi Coates (who had previously opposed reparations) resuscitated the idea. In 2014 he published his widely debated essay “The Case for Reparations” in the Atlantic magazine.Coates reflecting in a recentinterview with New York magazin said “When I wrote ‘The Case for Reparations’ my notion wasn’t that you could actually get reparations passed even in my lifetime. My notion was that you could get people to stop laughing. ... Once you got them to stop laughing you could get them to start fighting.”But even America’s first black president Barack Obama dismissed reparations as politically impractical and focused instead on race-blind policies in a “lift all boats” approach to economic inequality.Before resigning in 2017 Conyers reintroduced the bill with a new titleThe Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Ac which again called for appropriations for a commission study but also included a directive to create a plan for how the country would remedy the long-lasting harm of slavery through reparations.After Conyers’s resignation Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas in 2018 stepped in as the bill’s new sponsor and one year laterit to Congress. She also advocated for a commission that according to a press statement would “make recommendations concerning any form of apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement for slavery.”It was around this time presidential candidates began launching their White House bids and would be asked at town halls and in media appearances their stance on reparations. Four have either pitched policies that take an indirect approach to reparations or proposed full-blown compensation.When initially asked about reparations Sen. Kamala Harris D-Calif. said she was “serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities” but then in a follow-upsaid she wasn’t “going to do something that’s only going to benefit black people.”isn’t race-specific but the presidential hopeful has said it would “uplift 60 percent of Black families who are in poverty” along with all low- to middle-class Americans.The aggressive antipoverty bill would give families with an income of $100000 or less up to $500 in monthly cash payments in addition to public benefits and tax credits they already receive.Only working families those struggling with stagnant income and rising costs of living would benefit from this race-blind policy that would redistribute wealth. But although Harris claims her proposal would lift 9 million people out of poverty it wouldn’t specifically benefit African-Americans whose unemployment rate is double that of white Americans according to theSen. Cory Booker D-N.J. like Harris hasn’t outright endorsed reparations but offered an ambitious class-based policy to address the racial wealth gap. also known as his “baby bonds” would set up newborns from low-income families regardless of race with a low-risk savings account. The poorest families in this wealth-building program get up to a total of $50000 in their child’s trust account managed by Treasury which would receive annual deposits in proportion to the family’s income. At 18 the child can withdraw the money and use it for wealth-building uses like paying for college or buying property.have applauded Booker’s baby bonds plan as a race-neutral way to achieve reparations and close the racial wealth gap considering that among 18- to 25-year-olds the average white American has a net worth of $46000 whereas the average black American has $2900.But if Booker becomes president and his bill passes his first year the first babies to receive a savings account won’t be born until around 2022. The first beneficiaries wouldn’t be able to withdraw funds until they turn 18 in 204One of the few candidates who’s explicitly endorsed slavery reparations former secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro said it’s one way for America to “resolve its original sin of slavery.”“It is interesting to me that under our Constitution and otherwise that we compensate people if we take their property” Castro said in an. “Shouldn’t we compensate people if they were property sanctioned by the state?”Castro’s pro-reparations proposal aligns with H.R. 40 in establishing a commission to determine the best way to repay descendants of slaves.Marianne Williamson is the only candidate to take a bold stance on monetary compensation to descendants of slaves. The best-selling author and self-help guru has listed reparations as one of herand proposed “a $200 billion – $500 billion plan of reparations for slavery the money to be disbursed over a period of twenty years.”Although she’s the only candidate to specify an amount for reparations Williamson hasn’t offered a plan for distributing these funds except through “an esteemed council of African-American leaders council.”Yet she’s criticized policies that don’t directly offer monetary compensation like those offered by her presidential competitors “‘Race-conscious policies’ are not a substitute for reparations because they treat a symptom without acknowledging the cause.”Reparations have become a litmus test for Democratic candidates looking to secure diverse progressive voters. Black voters especially black women will be a key demographic for the Democratic Party in 2020 and the issue of reparations has been a way to gauge candidates’ loyalty to this traditionally loyal Democratic base.But the support for reparations among Americans is complicated. While 58 percent of black Americans support reparations 81 percent of white Americans oppose them according to ashowed the idea remained unpopular supported by only 26 percent of Americans.“The first question to be made [in the case for reparations] is a practical one which is how can we imagine putting together a political alliance that can prevail on an issue like that” Adolph Reed a University of Pennsylvania professor and a left-wing critic of reparations told Yahoo News.Appealing to the majority of the Democratic base is the only way to implement big ideas like reparations said Reed who worked on Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign.“The more broadly based coalition you can build the better you are [at winning]” he said. And winners added Reed can create “political and economic reform that promises to improve the material conditions of the vast majority of black Americans and increase the economic security of other Americans as well.”Reed argued that Democrats prompted by the question of reparations will have to choose between two visions for the party one that is identity-based and the other that seeks economic equality for all whichever is “more capable of resonating with the American population of all races ethnic groups and so forth and so on.”And reparations might not be the best idea for a candidate to rally behind in a crowded field. Still the opportunity for a national conversation is better than before says Duke University professor and reparations advocate William ""Sandy"" Darity who says policies like reparations “represent a break with kind of the moderatism that's been characteristic of the Democratic Party.”This break could be disastrous for Democratic candidates who are trying to strike a balance between appealing to minorities and millennials while also ensuring they don’t alienate white voters.In “a climate where people are considering things that are bolder more dramatic more transformative” Darity who’s written extensively on reparations and was one of the economists who created Booker’s “baby bonds” model credits the last presidential election with the willingness of 2020 candidates’ to discuss bold ideas like reparations.“The changed environment might be a consequence of the shock effect of the Trump election” he said. “It's created an opportunity for the conversation to turn to reparations in a much more serious way than it has in the past.”Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecKevin McAleenan has a good understanding of border operations: Former acting ICE DirectoA Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesProsecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock'",1

He'll need a plan.Yahoo News photo Illustration; photos: AP Getty ImageThe last time I’d been in Robie’s Country Store a local landmark in Hooksett N.H. I’d been shadowing. That was in the early summer of 2011 and Huntsman the former Utah governor who had just returned from his posting as President Obama’s ambassador to China was making his first much ballyhooed appearance as a presidential hopeful positioning himself as a moderate alternative to Mitt Romney.Huntsman was shaky his pitch to voters confusing. I compared him to the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer from “Saturday Night Live.” It turned out to be the apex of his campaign.So it was hard not to draw some comparisons as I returned to Robie’s late last month this time withon his first swing through the state.To be clear Hickenlooper isn’t Huntsman and it would be unfair to make too much of the parallels. The former Colorado governor is a more accomplished politician and he hasn’t been living in exile for the last two years. No frenzied horde of national journalists awaited his arrival; it was pretty much just me.But like Huntsman Hickenlooper holds himself out as a self-effacing consensus-seeking governor at a moment when the only consensus that interests a lot of Democrats is the one a jury might reach in the eventual trial of Donald Trump.And for Hickenlooper too these opening weeks of the campaign have been if not exactly a train wreck then maybe a minor collision with reality starting with his first interview on “Morning Joe” when Hickenlooper — the founder of a hugely successful chain of brewpubs and restaurants — refused to let himself be called a capitalist.Hickenlooper sounding remarkably Huntsman-esque later explained that he didn’t want to get bogged down in political labels even though “capitalist” would seem to be less of a label than an actual definition of what he used to be.“It’s very rare that the first time I’m asked a question I’m going to get it right” Hickenlooper admitted to me at Robie’s with characteristic candor. “I wish I’d answered it more elegantly for sure.”None of which is to say that Hickenlooper doesn’t have plenty of time to find his footing or that he doesn’t have a chance to win the nomination in 2020. He does.What he seems to be missing right now — and what a lot of Democratic hopefuls seem to be grasping for in this opening stage of the campaign — is a halfway convincing theory of how to get there.Hickenlooper walks into a room with assets few of his better-known or better-funded rivals can match. He has more executive experience than any of them along with a pretty compelling personal story and a record any candidate would envy.In 20 years of following presidential candidates around — I know lost time I try not to dwell on it — I’ve never before heard a candidate talk about how he got laid off and stayed out of work for two years and how all they did at the unemployment office was offer him useless advice on writing cover letters. (Hickenlooper was a government geologist during a recession in the 1980s.) It’s like hearing a Springsteen song run for president.Then as Hickenlooper tells it he was helping his brother repair a roof one day when he noticed a new brewpub in the distance and thought: Hey there’s a pretty good idea! Even his mother he says wouldn’t invest.From there he walks his audiences — sizable ones if not overflowing during this first campaign trip — through a series of episodes all meant to illustrate a single theme. As the owner eventually of 15 restaurants he persuaded all his competitors to get behind a joint marketing campaign helping to create Denver’s thriving LoDo district.Then after jumping into politics and getting himself elected mayor he went out to the surrounding suburbs where resentment of the city was deeply entrenched and got 34 mayors — most of them Republicans — to support a regional tax that paid for a new light-rail system.Then after becoming the first Denver mayor to win the governorship in more than a century Hickenlooper got energy companies to unite behind a plan to reduce methane emissions. (Once near the bottom of the pack in job creation Colorado now has one of the country’s hottest economies by the way.)The idea here is clear even if Hickenlooper sometimes rushes through his sentences or interrupts himself before he can finish them. This is a guy who bridges what are supposed to be unbridgeable divides. If Hickenlooper were the governor of Connecticut the Red Sox and Yankees would agree to share the state equally and everybody would win.He knows how all this talk of compromise sounds in the Trump era when a lot of younger Americans can’t even remember a time when the two parties in Washington collaborated on anything other than short-term bills to keep the government from shuttering. He’s pitching it anyway.“Isn’t that kind of what the country needs?” Hickenlooper asked me. “No one thought it was possible in the city and we got the mayors together. No one thought it was possible in Lower Downtown and we got the restaurants together. No one thought it was possible at the statehouse and we got the environmentalists and the oil and gas people together.“At every level there is an existing disbelief that is your hardest obstacle.”To push past that obstacle however you probably need a strategy to push back against the prevailing cynicism. Voters in New Hampshire seemed to like Hickenlooper enough but they didn’t walk away with a concrete sense of what sets him apart from other Democrats other than having been a good governor.Hickenlooper’s campaign signs in New Hampshire carried the slogan “Stand Tall” which probably made sense to someone or maybe they were left over from another campaign and could be had cheap. Is he saying he has a height advantage? Do the other candidates slouch?I thought about this for longer than I’d like to admit and really your guess is as good as mine.The real question here for Hickenlooper and for other Democratic candidates is whether they’re willing to choose a side on the ideological continuum of the moment which has nothing to do with the left-vs.-center debate that used to cleave the party.several times about the real philosophical dispute in the Republican Party — between governing Republicans who still believed in the value of expertise and anti-governing Republicans whose goal was to blow up the system. (Guess who won.)Democrats now can’t be so easily divvied up. Rather they’re all looking for a comfortable place to stand on a spectrum between emulating Trump’s view of governance on one hand and sweeping it aside on the other.On one end of that spectrum is a candidate like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren who fully embrace the idea that governing from the White House now is about going it alone as a party and stoking the fury of your base rolling out radical solutions and indicting the system as rigged and unworkable.At the other end would be a candidate — like Hickenlooper — who thinks the system as it exists is still plenty strong enough to function and that Democrats can still win over a lot of the voters who made their peace with Trump if only their nominee can show some flexibility and leadership.When I asked Hickenlooper for instance where he stands on some of the Democratic proposals we’ve been hearing to change the rules of the system like adding Supreme Court justices and eliminating the Electoral College he hesitated.“I do worry that if we got rid of the Electoral College completely it would undermine and somehow separate large parts of rural America from everyone else” he said. “I’m not against getting there but I think this is a time when we should be doing everything we can to connect rural America to everyone else.”There’s an assumption out there that Democratic primary voters are clearly closer to the Sanders-Warren camp and won’t choose a less confrontational candidate. I’m not so sure.That assumption is undermined in some part by the reaction of the growing crowds attracted by who repeatedly tells anyone who will listen that the election really isn’t about Trump and who only sounds angry when he’s railing against Mike Pence’s interpretation of Catholic doctrine. (And even then it’s more of a Midwestern anger lacking much bite.)But while Hickenlooper is philosophically on the other end of this spectrum from a Sanders or a Warren he’s thus far trying to avoid getting drawn into a fight. In fact his lack of differentiation from the other candidates on this score seems calculated.That’s because his advisers are hinging their strategy on the time-honored idea of “electability.”Democratic voters routinely tell pollsters that the thing they want most in a candidate is someone who can beat Trump. So the thinking in Hickenlooper’s camp is that you hang around through all this early drama and you avoid taking issue with anybody else’s crazy ideas and you just keep talking about your record and your progressive — but workable — ideas for the country.And eventually as the primaries draw nearer voters will get serious about choosing a candidate who can win and you’ll be in a great place because here you are as a solid electable purple-state governor who has avoided saying anything that will anger the tear-it-down crowd and you’ll become their perfect default choice.Which might be a really good strategy in a traditional field of say four real candidates. But it’s hard to see how that bears fruit in a field of 15.You might be able to make yourself palatable to enough Sanders voters by keeping your mouth shut and avoiding a nasty argument over single-payer health care but even if those voters decide that Sanders can’t win they’ll still have a bunch of acceptable candidates who more closely reflect their views than you do.Being everybody’s third choice doesn’t win you the nomination. Just ask Marco Rubio.Here’s the stone-cold truth: While governors dominated presidential politics for the 30-plus years before Barack Obama arrived the only governors who won were those who started out with a critique of their own party’s Washington establishment and the direction in which it was drifting.Ronald Reagan spent decades building a case against the accommodationist policies of the Republican elite. Bill Clinton beseeched his liberal party to focus on middle-class values and economics. George W. Bush campaigned against conservatism that had lost its compassion.And if a guy like Hickenlooper — who’s never really run a competitive primary unless you count his first campaign for mayor — is going to follow in their tracks he’ll probably have to throw down too.He’ll have to make voters choose — between the Trump model of speaking to a third of the country and telling it what it wants to hear or the harder more pragmatic approach of searching for consensus amid the ruins of Washington.There are signs in fact that Hickenlooper is starting to lean this way.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. offered a quick rejoinder to the president.Congress: “We’re going to need a copy of the President’s tax returns from 2013-2018.”45: “No I’m ‘under audit.’ ”Congress: “We didn’t ask you.”Democrats are seeking Trump’s tax returns to investigate allegations of corruption against the president and his businesses and the president’s legal team is promising a vigorous fight to keep them private.During the 2016 presidential campaign Trump became the first presidential candidate in 40 years to refuse to make tax returns public. The president has routinely explained that he would not make his returns public so long as they are under audit and in November asserted that “people wouldn’t understand” his complex returns.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a committee hearing on Capitol Hill in February. (Photo: Alex Brandon/AP)“Look as I’ve told you they’re under audit. They’re extremely complex. People wouldn’t understand them” Trump said at a White House news conference following the midterm elections that returned control of the House of Representatives to Democrats.Officials at the IRS — who presumably would be able to decipher the president’s taxes — have stated that an audit would not preclude the release of a tax return.Trump has also declined to provide an audit letter from the IRS that would show that his returns are indeed being audited.Wednesday’s request to the IRS by Democrats could answer numerous questions about the president’s business dealings including with foreign entities.If Neal is successful with his request we will find out if Trump is under audit as he’s insisted for years. The letter asks for whether the returns were ever under audit for how long and why.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Secret Service director fired by President TrumOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes Add to Supply ConcernAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburThis Unique Tax Break Can Help You Save Now and LateU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Eastern Libyan forces conduct air strikes on Tripoli as U.N. fails to reach trucChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesWhen Are State Tax Returns Due in New Mexico?,1

I hear what they’re saying; I understand it and I’ll be much more mindful that’s my responsibility ... my responsibility and I’ll meet it. I’ll always believe that governing quite frankly life for that matter is about connecting.

Al Sharpton’s National Action Network in Manhattan by sharing stories of individuals who fought for civil rights in his hometown of El Paso Texas. While praising their efforts O’Rourke also decried the lack of progress in the past 50 years.“I have thought for a long time that that is the history of change and civil rights and the path forward a courage a perseverance that leads to success” O’Rourke said. “But when I look at the facts and I listen to those whom I wish to serve as president … I see something different something foundationally systematically wrong in this country.”While the subject matter was not new for O’Rourke the prominence of Sharpton and his organization in the black community drew a crush of media attention.Democratic presidential candidate and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke speaks during the National Action Network Convention in Manhattan on Wednesday. (Photo: Seth Wenig/AP)O’Rourke went on to rattle off a series of issues to illustrate his point that racial equity in America remained an elusive goal.“We have an infant mortality discrepancy between white and black America that is worse today than it was in 1850 15 years before the abolition of slavery. We have a maternal mortality crisis in this country that is three times as deadly for women of color” the presidential candidate said.“We put more of our people behind bars per capita than any other country on the face of the planet disproportionately black and brown” he said. “Now we are arresting people for possession of a substance that is legal in more than half the states of the country.”O’Rourke also pointed out that marijuana convictions can prevent people from obtaining employment as well as from receiving financial aid for their education.“This schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline and this problem of mass incarceration is much deeper than our police and our courts. It is our country and we absolutely must face it” O’Rourke said.O’Rourke then addressed the issue of voting rights a major concern of civil rights activists. He framed the issue by criticizing voter ID laws gerrymandering and dark money as an effort by some to “aggregate” power. “Democracy” O’Rourke continued was the “only response to this concentration of wealth and power and privilege” in the country.“Not only must we sign into law a new Voting Rights Act so that every single American’s vote counts and they count equally not only must we end gerrymandering and big unaccountable money in our politics we must make sure that we have same-day and automatic voter registration in every single county and every single state throughout the United States of America” O’Rourke said.O’Rourke addressed two questions posed by the Rev. Al Sharpton during the National Action Network Convention in New York on Wednesday. (Photo: Seth Wenig/AP)O’Rourke wrapped up his remarks after about 11 minutes but before he left Sharpton pressed him with a pair of policy questions that seemed to be a nod to O’Rourke’s reputation for generalities.“Before he leaves — and I think he was specific — I want to ask one or two questions” Sharpton said.The reverend noted that earlier this year Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas introduced legislation to establish a commission that would consider reparations proposals for African-Americans to mitigate the impact of slavery and segregation. Sharpton asked O’Rourke if as president he would sign that bill if it passed.“Yes” O’Rourke said prompting cheers from the packed hotel ballroom.O’Rourke pointed toward someone who yelled at him from the crowd and said “I appreciate the woman who asked me to say ‘yes’ or ‘no.’”Noting his group’s work on cases of police violence Sharpton then pointed to President Trump’s decision to cut the use of consent decrees between the Justice Department and police departments. These agreements allowed the federal government to push for court-enforced changes in local police departments that were found to have persistent civil rights issues. Sharpton asked O’Rourke if he would “bring back” the practice.“The answer to this one is also yes” said O’Rourke.O’Rourke stressed “support” for police officers and sheriff’s deputies and their “incredibly difficult job” but emphasized the need for “accountability for the enforcement of law.”“There must be accountability for use of force” O’Rourke said. “Federal funds to local police departments and sheriff’s departments must be tied to accountability fully transparent reporting for use of force and justice for those who use force illegally.”O’Rourke is one of 12 Democratic candidates who are scheduled to speak at the National Action Network convention this week. Before O’Rourke spoke Sharpton noted his organization has played a role in the Democratic primary since 2000.“People running for office come. We’re not here to heckle them. We’re here to hear them. We’ll heckle them at the polls if we’ve got to but they need to all respect us … to come and address us. Anybody that does not address us does not respect us” Sharpton said.In his introduction Sharpton referenced the widespread attention O’Rourke received during his unsuccessful campaign for Senate in Texas last year. Sharpton said O’Rourke “emerged as a rock star” during that race. O’Rourke earned his “attention” Sharpton said by speaking out in support of athletes’ right to kneel during the national anthem.“That was not a politically expedient statement” Sharpton said adding “Then I caught him talking about white privilege and I had never seen a major white candidate for president talk about white privilege.”Despite saying O’Rourke had caught his eye Sharpton expressed skepticism about the candidate.“I’m suspicious of rock stars” Sharpton said. “You know James Brown raised me. … I know the difference between what’s live and Memorex.”After O’Rourke’s speech he had clearly earned some fans in the room. One woman in the audience shouted “Yes!” Some in the crowd broke out into a chant of “Run Beto! Run!” Sharpton acknowledged the reaction.“You didn’t hear the rest of the candidates yet!” Sharpton said to his audience before turning to O’Rourke.“Beto you done come in here and wiped out my board!” Sharpton said.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanBernie Sanders supports letting jailed felons vote in electionThe Latest: Beto O'Rourke says he's focused on White HousSenator Cory Booker Announces He'll Offer Bill To Study Potential ReparationAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesProsecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock'U.S. judge orders halt to Trump asylum seekers policThey’re fast they’re furious and they don’t have driver’s license,1

And people really thought that you had an unhinged president.”There was “a state of tension” and a “state of shock that was pervasive throughout the government at the time” Bharara said in an interview for theBharara considered a potential candidate for attorney general in a future Democratic administration is promoting his recently published book “Doing Justice.” During a discussion about the book the former top prosecutor provided new details about a tense moment on March 9 2017 when for a brief moment he and his deputy discussed secretly recording Trump. The discussion came after Bharara — who was appointed by President Obama but was originally asked to stay on by Trump — got a “bizarre” phone message that the president wanted to talk to him.Bharara never learned why Trump was calling. But he emphasized it was highly unusual for a president to be calling a U.S. attorney especially one who had jurisdiction over the Trump Organization and the president’s own business affairs. Although he had no open case on Trump he was concerned about the possibility the president would ask about some other ongoing criminal case creating an “awkward moment where I would have to end the conversation” and report it to the Justice Department.But he worried “Who’s gonna believe me?”Bharara consulted with his deputy Joon Kim. “We thought about and then rejected the possibility of recording the president” Bharara said “because we thought that’s a bridge too far. But we did think about it. Because the concern was ... both for my protection and the other party’s protection the other party being ... Individual-1 ... that nothing untoward was spoken about ... or he didn’t ask me for my loyalty etc. It would have been nice to have a record.” (“Individual-1” is how Trump was described last year in court documents filed by Bharara’s successor in the case against the president’s former lawyer Michael Cohen over violations of campaign finance law. Cohen pleaded guilty. Trump has not been charged in the case.)Bharara said he believes that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was thinking along the same lines — and “wasn’t joking” — when he too also briefly considered taping Trump in the days after the firing of Comey. And he doesn’t accept the argument that Trump being new to Washington didn’t understand the long-standing tradition that the White House shouldn’t interfere in or seek to influence Justice Department investigations.“Some people say ‘Well he doesn’t understand the protocols he doesn’t understand what the guidelines are it’s all new to him’” Bharara said. “That’s bulls***. ... He knows exactly what he’s doing. He knows exactly what is proper what’s not proper. Because he won the presidency in part by yelling at rallies in front of tens of thousands of people” about the airport meeting between then- Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton while the Justice Department was investigating Hillary Clinton’s email server.Bharara also said the “wacko” nature of Trump’s presidency has not dissipated. “Well there are spikes in wacko-ness right?” he said. And he added Trump has proven himself time and again to be a congenital liar — another reason Bharara and others have either considered secretly taping him or actually done so.“Look there’s a theme that runs through all people’s meetings with the president ... whether they’re allies like Michael Cohen or Omarosa [Manigault] or others or they’re people who you’re supposed to have some arm’s length distance from and they all want to document the phone calls. Either by recording them thinking about recording them memorialize them right away” he said.Preet Bharara. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photo: AP)Download or subscribe on iTunes:“Look this is not a partisan statement. The man lies. The man mischaracterizes not only what happens behind closed doors in meetings with people who wouldn’t be able to prove what words were actually uttered. He lies about the things that he says on national television the next day. ... Whether it’s in Helsinki or in any other context. A human being who so blithely lies about what he says and about what other people say you know what? Intelligent reasonable cautious folks like to think about how to protect their own reputations in that context.”Given the unusual nature of the Trump presidency — and his de facto immunity from criminal prosecution under current Justice Department policy — Bharara tends to side with House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler that the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller should be released — even if that seems to cut against the views expressed in his own book.In a chapter of his book titled “Walking Away” Bharara writes about the obligations of a prosecutor when he or she chooses not to indict a high-profile target and whether to explain to the public their reasons. It was a dilemma Bharara faced many times given the many high-profile investigations of targets from Wall Street mogul Steve Cohen to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio that never resulted in indictments.“We could demand that our prosecutors explain at length their decision to walk away especially when the smell of smoke is strong in public nostrils so citizens can be satisfied about the rectitude of those decisions” Bharara wrote in “Doing Justice.” “But prosecutors can get into deep trouble if they talk too much about a decision not to prosecute. ... After all the subject has a right to fairness also to be free from prosecutorial slander. You owe it to the system and to the guidelines of the department as well as to the presumed innocent party you chose not to charge to keep your mouth shut. It is a quandary. Believe me I appreciate the impulse to talk. A decision to decline to walk away is not a blessing of the conduct but in the system we have minimalism tends to be the best practice.”Bharara said however those words don’t necessarily apply to Mueller’s decision not to bring charges against Trump.“In your standard criminal case it’s a binary choice. And the only thing you can do is you can prosecute or not prosecute.” But he added “there’s two things that are unique about the president.” One is he has a “shield” against criminal prosecution due to Justice Department policy. The other factor is he is accountable to Congress through a potential impeachment process.And those factors Bharara argues should give Congress the authority to “take stock” of Trump’s conduct by seeing the Mueller report.“The president’s different from everyone else” he said.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes in Off-the-Rails Meghan McCain-Joy Behar Battle Over ImmigratioThey Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Kim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Prosecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock'Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesGaza animals find new home following deaths at zo,1

I don’t like it and you don’t like it either. You just don’t want to say it because you’re afraid of the press. You’re afraid of the press.”Last year Trump issued similar warnings about the U.S. Senate elections in Florida where Republican Gov. Rick Scott ultimately unseated the Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson. The president has also claimed without evidence that millions of illegal votes were cast in California in 2016 costing him the popular vote. A commission he established on voter fraud was quietly dissolved.Trump at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner in Washington D.C. on Tuesday.

It was the Bronx.Trump also weighed in about the mounting allegations against Biden. “The socialists are really taking care of him” Trump said repeating a theory that supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were behind recent stories about the former vice president’s behavior with women.“I was going to say ‘Welcome to the world Joe’” Trump quipped. “You having a good time Joe?”And in a bizarre aside the president continued his attack on turbine power which a few days earlier he said incorrectly would cause power blackouts when there was no wind.“If you have a windmill anywhere near your house congratulations your house just went down 75 percent in value” Trump said. “And they say the noise causes cancer.

You can watch the current week's full episode of “Dear Men” every Wednesday at 8 p.m. ET on Roku.Actor Matt McGorry known for his outspoken embrace of feminism has some advice for men who need help navigating the #MeToo era: Seek “affirmative enthusiastic consent.”In a new interview the “How to Get Away with Murder” star told the Yahoo News show “Dear Men” that most men were not taught consent in a valuable way.“A lot of it is we’re not taught anything except by our peers and by my industry — by film and television” he said. “What does the cool guy look like? He knows about sex he takes what he wants oftentimes we see the guy in the middle of the conversation and grabs and kisses her. And what if she didn’t want to kiss him? [What] we’re taught about consent is just keep going. Just keep going until you get a ‘no.’”He said it should be just the opposite for men.“Every step of the way you ask” he explained. “And unless someone seems excited to go to the next step move forward if they don’t stop.”It’s no surprise that McGorry who also had a recurring role in “Orange Is the New Black” is speaking out on consent and other issues important to women. He’s known for his gender equality activism especially on and has received some backlash from both men and women over his online proclamations.In the future consider not rolling out a male feminist project or whatever on the one day that's about women.I asked McGorry a single white male in Hollywood why he’s an advocate for women when he doesn’t necessarily have to be.“It’s not my place to be the voice of Black Lives Matter it’s not my place to be the voice of feminism. It is my place to be the voice of white anti-racism or to be the voice that is encouraging men to embrace feminism” McGorry said. “Being much more specific and intentional about who I’m talking to rather than just speaking out I think is really important because that is our work as allies is really to engage men.”So how do we engage men in these conversations? It starts with having honest dialogue about the meaning of consent and what is acceptable behavior and what is not. We have heightened responsibility to be clear with our partners about whether or not they chose to participate in sexual contact.A seemingly never-ending series of prominent men have faced a wide array of sexual misconduct scandals in recent years including titans in Hollywood broadcast journalism and business.Former Vice President Joe Biden a leading potential 2020 presidential candidate has been caught up in a consent-related controversy of his own astwo women have come forwarsaying he violated their space in past years and were left feeling deeply uncomfortable.But it’s not just celebrities and politicians who grapple with the gray area. We asked men what’s on their minds as they navigate the #MeToo era and we got some honest answers.“I think with the #MeToo movement you think about all the interactions you've had at work when you're out partying with colleagues” said Tony Newman. “I think if you're not reflecting on that in this period then you got your head in the sand.”“I don’t find that I caused the problem but I recognize that it is my responsibility to say something to that a**hole on the train that’s kind of rude to a young girl” said Mike Bunton.“I remember I’m in college and I’m a male and there’s alcohol. I saw men behaving in ways that … was equivalent to rape” said Doug Davis. “I wish that I had known what I know now or had more balls or something but stepped up.”But are we going too far? Is romance becoming too transactional? In my opinion if it helps avoid confusion and discomfort I’m all for slowing down and taking the time to check in with your partner. If it leads to healthier more fulfilling relationships then we are all the better for it.Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburThe Mormon Church Tries to Create a Little More Space for LGBTQ FamilieU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Pete Buttigieg wants 'the Mike Pences of the world' to know his same-sex marriage 'moved me closer to God'Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in Banglades17 Staggering Sexual Assault Statistics Everyone Should ReaU.S. judge orders halt to Trump asylum seekers policThey’re fast they’re furious and they don’t have driver’s licenseFather allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworGabrielle Union cheers on Dwyane Wade's son at gay pride paradVape pen explodes rips away chunk of man's face breaks some teeth lawsuit say,1
window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');Joe Biden comes face to face with a changing cultureJoe Biden comes face-to-face with a changing culturFormer Vice President Joe Biden. (Photo: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)At the start of our societal reckoning over the bad behavior of men the red lines were clear. The bad guys were easy to identify the toxic behavior obvious. The question was never whether Harvey Weinstein’s actions were wrong but why people who might have stopped him did nothing.But as with any broad social movement things quickly became more complicated. It is simple to condemn things that even the perpetrator knew were wrong when he did them. Trading movie roles for sex? Wrong. Installing remote-controlled locks on office doors? Drugging unwitting sex partners? Sexual relationships with minors? Wrong wrong wrong.Less clear is how to hold men to account for things that raise eyebrows today but might not have even a few years ago. Sexist jokes? Tone-deaf passes? Hugging everyone within arm’s reach at fundraising dinners?Which brings us to Joe Biden.The 76-year-old former vice president and prospective presidential candidate is embroiled in controversy after two women came forward in the past few days accusing him of being too handsy and affectionate. Neither Nevada legislator Lucy Flores nor former political aide Amy Lappos says that Biden’s behavior toward her was threatening or overtly sexual but both say it made them decidedly uncomfortable.“It was demeaning and disrespectful” said Flores of the time in 2014 when she says Biden put his hands on her shoulders “inhaled my hair” and “plant[ed] a big slow kiss on the back of my hea“It wasn’t sexual but he did grab me by the head. He put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me” Lappos said of the 2009 incident at a Connecticut fundraiser. “It’s an incredibly uncomfortable situation and not at all acceptable.”The conversation in the days since has essentially been about the spectrum from Weinstein to Biden. Does it matter that Biden did what he did — these two incidents and the countless other times he hugged and touched people — openly often in front of cameras exhibiting a public persona more like an exuberant puppy than a predator?The stories of Biden being Biden go back years. In 2014 NPR referred to his “trademark embraces” when describing how he enthusiastically kissed and hugged a 102-year-old woman who had come to see him during a visit to a job-training program. After a kiss that barely missed her mouth he said “I need a hug” and leaned on in for one wrote reporter Tamara Keith.In fact all this touching and feeling has long been part of Biden’s appeal. As he has said of himself “I am a tactile politician.”Biden hugs Sally Steffen during a campaign stop on Sept. 18 2012 in Ottumwa Iowa. (Photo: Charlie Neibergall/AP)After his son Beau died three years ago social media was filled with stories of the support Biden had given people when they were grieving. And over the past few days others have stepped forward to describe how his literal and virtual hugs were welcome in their lives.“Joe Biden is one of the truly decent and compassionate men in all of American politics” wrote Meghan McCain on Twitter. “He has helped me through my fathers diagnosis treatment and ultimate passing more than anyone of my fathers friends combined. I wish there was more empathy from our politicians not less.”And in an essay on Medium Stephanie Carter the wife of former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter defended Biden against commenters who called a photo of Biden with his hands on her shoulders during her husband’s swearing-in “is a close friend helping someone get through a big day for which I will always be grateful” she wrote. She had taken a spill on some ice in front of cameras earlier in the day she explained and was still feeling “uncharacteristically nervous ... as Ash was giving remarks.” That was when Biden “leaned in to tell me ‘thank you for letting him do this’ and kept his hands on my shoulders as a means of offering his support.”The fact that the latest Biden accusations have traction however shows that there is more than one way to view that image. And like a 1980s hairstyle something that looked normal and even flattering in one era comes to look completely different with time.And that — the passage of time the fact that this is a new moment — is far more likely the takeaway of this current Biden brouhaha.Biden “has to understand that in the world we are in now people’s space is important to them and what’s important is how they receive it not necessarily how you intended it” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who while three years older than Biden has avoided coming across as a throwback to an earlier era.She even had some stage instructions.“Join the straight-arm club” Pelosi said advising her fellow Democrat to stick to arm’s-length handshakes with men and women alike. “Just pretend you have a cold and I have a cold.”Biden himself stopped short of apologizing but in a statement he did suggest that he knew times had changed and he had to change with them. “In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life I have offered countless handshakes hugs expressions of affection support and comfort” he said in a statement. “And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately. But we have arrived at an important time when women feel they can and should relate their experiences and men should pay attention. And I will.”Still even if Biden can and does change the allegations themselves contain a reminder to voters that at this stage of the reckoning — the part near the end where hairs are being split as well as sniffed — the way to end the chapter might be to simply move on to leaders who did not appear as characters in that chapter at all. In fact that seems to be much of the point of bringing this up now.Lappos hinted at this when she made her original allegation on Sunday on a Facebook page for Connecticut Women in Politics that waspicked up by the Hartford Couran“If Biden truly supports women and gender equality he would step aside and support one of the many talented and qualified women running” she wrote. “The same goes for the other men who have thrown their hat in the ring. Women are 52 percent of the population. We are not a minority we are the majority. It is time we are represented as such. After 45 male presidents it is time we elect a woman.”The women already in the race have more than hinted at the same.“If we spend our whole time talking about what men had done and what they didn’t do we are never going to talk about what women can do” said presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar when asked about the allegations about Biden in a television interview.In short Biden proudly but also problematically represents an old era at a time when many voters want a new one. If these allegations dent his prospective candidacy it will not be because they show the man to be different than anyone thought he was but because it is time for the country to be different than it used to be.As New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg: “He’s the product of his time and his time is up.”Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanThe tricky line Joe Biden faces if he enterThe Week In Washington: “The Democrats Will Never Be Satisfied!”Augusta Golf Baylor NCAA Rent the Runway Kids: Broadsheet April'Game Of Thrones' Meets 'Saturday Night Live' In Kit Harington MonologuYahoo!

(Photo: Mike Kane/Bloomberg via Getty Images)WASHINGTON — When Jeff Bezos’s personal security consultant Gavin De Beckerwhat amounted to a startling indictment of the National Enquirer on Saturday alleging that the tabloid publication may have worked with Saudi Arabia to expose the Amazon CEO’s affair there was one thing missing: any evidence for the claim.“Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone and gained private information” De Becker wrote in an op-ed in the Daily Beast adding that it was “unclear” if the Saudis had actually worked with the Enquirer which first published details of the affair.De Becker’s lack of details on the alleged hack may be because he doesn’t want to tip his hand in advance of an FBI investigation or any potential court proceedings. However the notable lack of technical detail has led multiple cybersecurity experts to call for further details before speculating on the events Saudi capabilities or the potential consequences of that behavior.“If the Gulf states are going hog-wild on U.S. persons that would be big news” said Eva Galperin director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “But it’s also a claim that requires evidence.”Dave Venable a former intelligence officer at the National Security Agency who advises on information-security issues agreed. “While it wouldn’t be surprising if Jeff Bezos’ claims of Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the hack turn out to be true any claim of this magnitude needs to be backed up with strong forensic evidence” he told Yahoo News.In the last decade technology used to spy on people and monitor or steal personal information from inside digital devices has proliferated across the Middle East and North Africa where governments have different views of civil liberties and privacy — as well as what might constitute a crime. Companies like NSO Group in Israel and Hacking Team in Italy have sold tools and capabilities to governments particularly in the oil-rich Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.However De Becker’s op-ed does not indicate that the investigative team had obtained forensic evidence of an intrusion into any of Bezos’s devices nor does it suggest that evidence if it exists has been reviewed by outside peers as has been done with other notable hacking cases.It’s possible that the well-resourced team within Amazon did its own forensics or that De Becker obtained intelligence from another source. However there are independent organizations with a strong track record on similar issues like Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto which relies on multiple forensic experts who track Middle Eastern spyware particularly on mobile devices.Citizen Lab experts have published extensively on companies including NSO Group which markets and sells advanced hacking tools to governments around the world including Saudi Arabia. If NSO or another regional company was involved Citizen Lab would likely be familiar with the type of forensic evidence Amazon’s team may have been analyzing.that its tools were used to hack Bezos.Independent security experts and former intelligence officials suggested that Saudi digital capabilities remain nascent; the oil-rich kingdom still heavily relies on outsourcing hacking tools from companies like NSO and before that Hacking Team.“If the purchased tool is sophisticated it might be designed to leave no evidence” said Timo Steffens an author focused on researching targeted cyberattacks and attribution online. However he continued “unless there is forensic evidence anything mentioned in that article is rather weak in front of a court.”De Becker’s new claims follow what has been a whirlwind story of power wealth and celebrity. In January Bezos and his wife announced they were divorcing just before the National Enquirer published an investigation which included leaked intimate texts revealing that the Amazon founder had been having an affair with a former TV host Lauren Sanchez. In February Bezos revealed some of the including details of how David Pecker CEO of the Enquirer’s parent company AMI was allegedly blackmailing him with racy photographs documenting the affair. Bezos also suggested there might be Saudi involvement in obtaining his private data.Since then Michael Sanchez Lauren’s brother came forward as the source of the leaked material. The Enquirer which has acknowledged Sanchez as a source has denied any cooperation with Saudi Arabia on the Bezos story.The FBI declined to comment on whether it had opened an investigation or received evidence from De Becker.Saudi Arabia has begun dipping its toes in the waters of creating its own domestic private capabilities — but largely remains dependent on outside entities. One company inside Saudi Arabia according to a security expert from the region is called Haboob.That company also appears to be an industry novice. According to Joseph Cox a digital-security journalist at Motherboardan official from Haboob reached outo him to try and purchase hacking tools — not realizing that Cox is a journalist.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanOPEC+ Learns From the Past as New Oil Cutbacks Hit the MarBezos hired a SpaceX vice president to run Amazon's satellite internet project after Musk fired hiU.S. Energy Makes Another Crack in Saudi Bastion With LPG SaleGhosn's Fate May Hang on Complex Financial Web in Middle EasInvestors flock to Saudi Aramco's debut international bonAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburU.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicThey Say It’s Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201PHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'PHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesU.S. judge orders halt to Trump asylum seekers policThey’re fast they’re furious and they don’t have driver’s licenseFather allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homewor,1

It was the Bronx.Speaking to reporters in the White House Tuesday President Trump misstated his father’s place of birth as Germany rather than New York City.“My father is German right? Was German. And born in a very wonderful place in Germany so I have a great feeling for Germany” Trump said during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg who is from Norway.Trump’s father Frederick Christ Trump was born in the Bronx on Oct. 11 1905.Tuesday’s misstatement was not the first time that the president has incorrectly identified his father’s birthplace. In a 2018 interview with “Fox News Sunday” Trump did the same.“I was there many many years ago” the president said of the European Union which was not founded until 1993. “Meaning my parents were born in the European Union. I love these countries; Germany Scotland they are still in there right?”Fred Trump with Donald Trump. (Adam Scull/Photolink/MediaPunch/IPX)During a visit to Scotland last July Trump accurately that his mother was from Scotland but he repeated the misinformation about his father.“Don’t forget both of my parents were born in EU sectors — my mother was Scotland my father was Germany.”Trump’s grandfather Friedrich was indeed born in the German town of Kallstadt on March 14 1869. Friedrich immigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16 but did so before fulfilling his military service. In 1905 the kingdom of Bavaria wrote Friedrich a letter ordering him never to return.Seeking to distance himself from his German heritage Trump’s father Fred a prominent builder in New York went on to claim Swedish heritage probably for business reasons.“He said ‘You don’t sell apartments after the war if you’re German’” Trump’s cousin John Walter told the. “So he’s Swedish no problem.”Trump himself pushed this false narrative in “The Art of the Deal” saying his father had emigrated “from Sweden as a child.”By 2000 Trump dropped the ruse admitting that the story had come about because “being from Germany didn’t necessarily play so well for a period of time.”For the record the president was born in Queens New York at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center on June 14 1946.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecCalif.

(Photo: Getty Images)WASHINGTON — Efforts by House Democrats to extend federal civil rights protections to transgender individuals encountered determined opposition from Republicans who claimed the move would endanger women. The Republican argument sometimes verged on the outlandish as when one congressman mused about President Trump becoming a woman.At issue before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday morning was a billknown as the Equality Act or H.R. that would make transgender people a “protected class” underTitle VII of the Civil Rights Ac which forbids discrimination based on race and ethnicity among other factors.Democrats framed the issue as that of equality. “We see you we support you and we believe in you” said the committee’s chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York addressing viewers of the hearing in the LGBTQ community.“You are worth fighting for” he added a few moments later.The hearing comes as transgender rights have become a furiously debated cultural and political issue. President Trump has reversed Obama-era directivesincluding one that allowed trans people to serve in the militarand another that allowed trans students in public schools to use bathrooms thatconformed to their gender identitie“Transgender Rights Are Under Siege in Trump’s America”read a headline late last year in the left-leaning Nation magazin echoing a popular conviction among progressives.Republicans at Tuesday’s hearing avoided Trump-like invective carefully espousing respect for transgender rights while also steadfastly arguing that such rights should not be expanded. That argument was predicated on the conviction that men masquerading as women would exploit such protections by using women’s bathrooms or playing on women’s sports teams. The committee’s ranking member Rep. Doug Collins R-Ga. worried that H.R. 5 would “codify an internet phenomenon into federal law” implying that trans identity was little more than the product of social media peer pressure. That view has been""If President Trump were to say 'I'm am now the first female president' who would celebrate that?""Rep. Matt Gaetz R-Fla. said he was concerned about “bad actors” using as a hypothetical example of Trump declaring himself the first female president.“Who would celebrate that?” Gaetz wondered.Rep. Ken Buck R-Colo posed an even more outlandish scenario to one of the witnesses Jami Contreraswho faced discrimination in seeking medical care for her chilbecause she is in a same-sex marriage.“Is it your position” Buck asked Contreras “that an Orthodox Jewish doctor whose grandparent was killed in the Holocaust be required to work with a Nazi patient?”Nazis are not a protected class meaning that adherents of a political ideology — in this case fascism — are not covered by the anti-discrimination statute of the Civil Rights Act. A seemingly confused Contreras answered by pointing out that she and her wife were raising their child according to “Christian values” and wanted only protection from prejudice.Carter Brown founder of the group Black Transmen made the same point describing how he was mocked and maligned at work for being trans. He was eventually dismissed from his job but had little legal recourse since Texas law does not have protections for trans people.“My experience left me embarrassed and vulnerable” Brown said.Seventeen states have gender-identity protectionsaccording to the National Transgender Law Cente while 27 states have either few or no such protections.The core of the Republican argument at the hearing was that any fluidity in gender identity is a choice. That choice they argued would largely be exercised men attempting to masquerade as women. H.R. 5 “automatically privileges the rights of biological men over biological women” as Rep. Collins put it describing the bill as nothing more than “identity politics with no basis in science.”Science in fact increasingly does not appear to be on Republicans’ side. New research suggests that biological gender and sexual identity meaning that terms like “biological men” and “biological women” have less relevance. Nor is thereevidence that expanded trans rights result in greater harassment of womeSeveral Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee argued it was ironic for the Republican Party to cast itself as the party to protect women given its opposition to reproductive rights and paid family leave.Not all of the law’s critics were conservatives. “We risk losing all of our sex-segregated spaces if H.R. 5 passes” said Julia Becka self-described “radical feminist lesbian”who believes along with many conservatives that trans rights infringe on the rights of women.And Rep. Debbie Lesko R-Ariz. cited a recent article critical of H.R. 5 by Andrew Sullivan a writer for New York magazine. Sullivan who is openly gaywrote that what he called transgender “ideology” is a “threat to homosexuality because it is a threat to biological sex as a concept.”The hearing which resolved little came two days after the international Transgender Day of Visibility.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanUS economy will hit 3% growth this year: First Trust Advisors' Brian WesburKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaOil Hits a Five-Month High as Libya Clashes Add to Supply ConcernExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburCompromise?

Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign held a press call with reporters on Tuesday where they touted figures showing the diversity of their staff and supporters. Former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner a co-chair of the Sanders campaign said this was evidence the senator “is bringing the rainbow mosaic of humanity together all across this country.”On his way to losing the Democratic primary to Hillary Clinton in 2016 Sanders was dogged by the impression he was not popular with minorities and thatmany of his supporters were male “Bernie bros”who were hostile towards women.“The senator is really popular and supported by a diverse coalition despite the narrative that is put out there from time to time” Turner said on the call.Turner went on to cite figures froma Harvard Institute of Politics youth pol which was conducted last month and surveyed 18-to-29-year-old Democratic primary voters.“He is leading among young women by about five points. … So the boys are following the girls and he has a lead among young Latinx voters. He leads by 19 points among that group” said Turner.released last month which said 71 percent of black Democrats had a favorable view of Sanders.“It just continues to boggle my mind why people want to put out a narrative out that the African-American community is not vibing with Sen. Bernie Sanders. They are vibing with him” Turner said “And I know that anecdotally but I know that from what the polls are saying.”While that poll did show Sanders with high favorability among African-American voters he trailed former Vice President Joe Biden in that category by six points. The two of them had higher favorability among black voters than any other likely Democratic primary candidates. Generally polls of the field have showed Sanders and Biden on top.Demonstrating strong support from minority voters is clearly a priority for Sanders’s campaign. In January when Yahoo News first reported that Sanders was set to launch his White House bid a source said one of themajor factors behind his decision to run agaiwas that he was heartened to see polls indicating he is one of the leading candidates among African-American and Latinx voters.At the start of the press call the main purpose of which was to announce Sanders’sof $18.2 million over the first 41 days of his presidential bid his campaign manager Faiz Shakir also touted the diversity of the senator’s campaign staff.“It was important to the senator that we have a campaign that reflects America and that it’s a camp that lives our values. … You see that in the diversity of the staff quite frankly” Shakir said adding that the campaign’s staff is “roughly 40 percent of people of color” and women are in the majority.According to Shakir the campaign has a staff of “roughly 100 people” and the diversity is reflected in “each department.”The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for a more detailed breakdown of their staff diversity statistics. However the campaign’s top leadership includes people of color including Shakir who is Pakistani-American. Turner and the deputy campaign manager Rene Spellman are both African-American women.Shakir also pointed to the campaign’s unionized workforce.The perception that Sanders struggles with minority voters particularly African-Americans stemmed largely from hisperformance in the South Carolina primary in 201. Sanders lost that state to Hillary Clinton and exit polls indicated she earned over 80 percent of the black vote there. South Carolina is the first state on the Democratic primary calendar with a significant African-American electorate.“We are assembling a strong team in South Carolina and [are] looking forward to being in that state in a very deep way” Turner said when asked on the press call if Sanders would be aiming to win the state this time around.Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanThe question Warren Buffett would ask presidential candidateAfter 2016 loss Democrats know they need white male voterSenator Cory Booker Says He's Raised $5 Million For His 2020 Presidential BiHow Many Millions Does It Take to Win the 2020 Nomination?India's Modi-led alliance closes in on majority survey shows ahead of votAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in Ugand,1

The president briefly pushed for Republicans in Congress to come up with an alternative plan a strategy that would have been dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.“Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work” wrote Trump. “Premiums &amp; deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it but with Medicare for all which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) &amp; deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive &amp; much more usable than ObamaCare.”“Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate &amp; win back the House” continued Trump citing the timing. “It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America. Also Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions. The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare. Meantime the USA is doing better than ever &amp; is respected again!”President Trump and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan celebrate in May 2017 after the then-GOP House passed a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The bill failed in the Senate. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)The comments echo those made during the campaign that Republicans would offer a great plan that covered everyone at a lower cost without any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid. Trump began making the promises in aSeptember 2015 interview with “60 Minute” making vague promises when pressed by Scott Pelley on how he would fix it.“There’s many different ways by the way” said Trump. “Everybody’s got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say ‘No no the lower 25 percent that can’t afford private.’ But—“Universal health care?” interjected Pelley.“I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not” said Trump. “Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.”“The uninsured person is going to be taken care of how?” asked Pelley.“They’re going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And you know what if this is probably—”“Make a deal?” asked Pelley. “Who pays for it?”“The government’s gonna pay for it” promised Trump. “But we’re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it’s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors they can have plans they can have everything.”“We’re going to have insurance for everybody”he reiterated in a January 2016 interview with the Washington Pos. “There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can’t pay for it you don’t get it. That’s not going to happen with us.”President Donald Trump waves after signing an executive order on health care in the Roosevelt Room of the White House Oct. 12 2017 in Washington. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)Upon taking office Trump continued to make promises of a hypothetical ideal health care plan.“We have a plan that I think is going to be fantastic. It’s going to be released fairly soon” Trump said after aFebruary 2017 meeting with health insurer. “I think it’s going to be something special … I think you're going to like what you hear.”The following day he pointed out something that those who have worked on health care policy have known for decades: It’s extremely complicated.“We have come up with a solution that’s really really I think very good” Trump said. “Now I have to tell you it’s an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.”Most Americans in fact knew how complicated health care was and Trump’s judgment that the Republican solution was “really really very good” wasn’t shared by independent auditors or the American public.The Congressional Budget Office found in March 201that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the Republicans’ proposed Obamacare replacement would have knocked 14 million people off of insurance in one year and 24 million more by 2026it would raise health care costs for older Americans by thousands of dollars. The Republican House passedan amended version of the AHCleading to a Rose Garden celebration with Trump and House Speaker Paul Rya but it died in the Senate.The legislation would have slashed Medicaidespite Trump’s repeated promises to the contrarThe July 2017 “skinny repeal” vote that barely failed in the Senate following “no” votes from Republican Sens. Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and John McCainwas estimated by the CBO to result in 16 million more uninsured Americanby 2026 and a 20 percent rise in premiums. Researchers also found thatwould have died prematurely if theCapitol Hill police prepare to arrest protesters of the Republican health care bill outside the offices of Sen. Dean Heller R-Nev. in July 2017. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)The proposed Obamacare replacements were also unpopular with the American public.A May 2017 Quinnipiac polfound support for the AHCA at just 21 percent.A July 2017 study by an MIT professofound that the AHCA was the least popular legislation in three decades.Over the course of 201 Republicans found themselves under fire atdistrict town halls over the pla. Rep. Tom MacArthur R-N.J.who was given credit for almost singlehandedly saving the Obamacare repeal effor lost his seat in the November 2018 midterms after winning by 21 points in 2016.The attempts to repeal Obamacare also taking it from negative-3 approval in December 2016 to plus-11 in March 2019.Trump’s 2019 proposal — which consists of backing a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare but not coming up with a replacement until after the 2020 election — seems unlikely to help rebrand the GOP as “the party of health care.” The legal challenge to Obamacare which is now before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals presumably will end up at the Supreme Court sometime next yeaLegal experts believe the couris unlikely to side with the administration.) Without protections for preexisting conditions provided by Obamacare theKaiser Family Foundation estimated in 2015that up to 52 million people could be denied coverage.if the Medicaid expansion that was adopted by dozens of states and D.C. was killed. A full repeal with no immediate replacement plancould also hurt the fight against opioid addiction and HILast week in an interview with Sean Hannity “incredible health care that the Democrats frankly wouldn’t know how to do.”Republicans insist they want to pass a plan that requires insurers to offer coverage for preexisting conditions butwithout a mechanism to control or subsidize premiums which was the problem the ACA sought to address with its controversial individual mandate. That mandate was repealed in the 2017 Republican tax bill.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy R-Calif. speaks with reporters during a news conference at the Capitol in Washington March 8 2019. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP)Congressional Republicans have so far kept their distance from Trump’s plan. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthythat the decision to back the Obamacare repeal in court made no sense considering how that issue hurt Republicans in the midterms. Health care was the No. 1 issue for voters in 2018 with those who ranked it most important voting for Democrats bya margin of 75 to 2. McCarthy is not alone in his caucus.“Not only is this a poor political move this decision hurts real people who will unfairly lose their health insurance coverage as a result” Rep. Tom Reed R-N.Y.said in a statement to the Washington Pos. “We need to work to find ways to fix our health care system – not blow it up.”Democrats have seen Trump’s move back towardhealth care as an opportunit“The Republicans did say during the campaign that they weren’t there to undermine the preexisting condition benefit and here they are right now saying they’re going to strip the whole Affordable Care Act as the law of the land”said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last wee adding “This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity.”Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanThey Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Whoopi Goldberg Intervenes in Off-the-Rails Meghan McCain-Joy Behar Battle Over ImmigratioKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201With vaping under fire for potential links to seizures tobacco-free snuff latest alternative to help smokers quiChinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesAmerican Kim Sue Endicott guide abducted in Uganda returned safely after ransom pai,1

(Screengrab via House.gov)“Every day that there is an insecure line of communication that could be leaked that could be hacked that could be screenshotted without proper channels is a day that we are putting our national security at risk” she added.The whistleblower White House security adviser Tricia Newbold raised concerns about the high-level security clearances given to the officials including three unnamed White House officials.that President Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner are among the officials involved.There have previously been reports that Trump personally intervened after clearances for Ivanka and Kushner were denied them. Abbe Lowell an attorney for both Ivanka and Kushner has previously said the couple’s clearances were “handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone.”Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP)In a letter the oversight committee requested that the White House turn over a list identifying the 25 individuals.The committee also requested information from the Executive Office of the President People Information Center database for nine current and former White House officials including Kushner Ivanka and National Security Adviser John Bolton.A Democratic committee aide told Yahoo News that all nine of these officials were not necessarily among those who were initially denied clearances and said the records were being requested based on “previous public reporting” about issues with their clearances.Republicans accused House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings D-Md. of cherry-picking excerpts from Newbold’s testimony to justify another partisan investigation into the Trump White House.The GOP members of the committee called Cummings’s decision to move forward with the investigation into Newbold’s claims “reckless.”Cummings said Newbold came forward at great personal risk because she feared Republican retaliation.

But neither the president nor Democrats are moving on.In the week since Barr released his summary of the two-year investigation which found no collusion but fell short of determining obstruction of justice Trump on a near-daily basis has boasted that the report is proof of his “complete and total exoneration” while simultaneously denouncing its credibility.“Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion No Obstruction Trump Campaign began. We need to know for future generations to understand” TrumpYahoo News photo illustration; photos: AP Getty Images via TwitteAnd Democrats agree that the country needs to know more about the report. In an ensuing battle over the report and its release to Congress and the public Democrats have demanded that Barr testifyand release the full unredacted report. Barr said the report can be redacted and ready for release by mid-April. He has agreed to testify in May.“No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report” Trump said in a “it will never be good enough.”Because all the public has seen so far is Barr’s brief summary it’s unknown whether the Democrats in Congress will be satisfied if their demand to see the full report is met.Trump also went after the media calling for some outlets’Pulitzer Prizes to be taken awato television producers suggesting they ban several former and current government officials from speaking on their shows including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.“There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff” Trumpearly Tuesday coining yet another derisive nickname for Schiff whom he previously mocked as “pencil neck” and whose surname he once misspelled in a tweet with two t’s turning it into a scatological epithet. “It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!”Rep. Nadler D-N.Y. intends to push for the unredacted Mueller report via subpoena which the judiciary committee will vote on Wednesday to authorize or not.Trump blasted Nadler’s demands for the report comparing them to the chairman's opposite treatment of independent counsel Ken Starr’s report on the investigation of then-President Bill Clinton.“In 1998 Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report which the Dems hate he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!” Trump said viaAfter the Starr investigation ended Nadler was critical of Clinton butthe report was “grand jury material” and included “all kinds of material that it would be unfair to release.”Meanwhile Rep. Schiff D-Calif. whom Trump recently has been one of the most outspoken skeptics of Barr’s conclusions and maintains his stance that there is still “significant evidence of collusion” in the 2016 presidential election.“Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released most Democrats and others have gone back to the pre-Witch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over”Trump on Twitter Monday. “Others are pretending that their former hero Bob Mueller no longer exists!”Read more from Yahoo News:At meeting of top spies the focus is on China not MuelleBannon: With Mueller probe over Trump ‘is going to go full animal’Does the media owe Trump an apology?How Democratic Party insiders could make a comeback at the 2020 conventioThe rent is too damn high so here’s how some candidates hope to lower iPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesKelly Clarkson had the most perfect response when someone mistook her for a seat filler at the ACM AwardWWE Star Bret 'The Hitman' Hart Speaks Out After Being Tackled by Fan During Hall of Fame SpeecGabrielle Union cheers on Dwyane Wade's son at gay pride paradFather allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworMiranda Lambert Gives Ex Blake Shelton A Country Dissin' At ACM AwardAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Vape pen explodes rips away chunk of man's face breaks some teeth lawsuit sayPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesProsecutor In Foxx's Office Slams Her Handling of Smollett Case: 'An International Laughingstock'",1

(Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)As troubles mount on the borders a brash right-wing leader beset by allegations of corruption is seeking reelection facing opponents promising to restore trust in the country’s democratic institutions and heal deep partisan divisions.The country is Israel and the candidate is Prime Minister Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu but if the scenario has echoes in U.S. politics that is more than coincidental. Not perhaps since Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt fought World War II side by side have the leaders of two countries been more closely aligned than Netanyahu and President Trump. And what happens in the Israeli elections on Tuesday could both foreshadow and affect Trump’s fate.Netanyahu’s legal problems have intensified as he faces the greatest challenge to his political survival in a decade. The prime minister has been a suspect in several investigations for more than two years with investigators alleging that Netanyahu received lavish gifts from several billionaires in exchange for personal favors and that he exchanged favorable legislation and regulatory measures for positive coverage by some media outlets. Those investigations came to a head in February when Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced his intention to indict Netanyahu on charges of breach of trust bribery and fraud.The official indictment is not expected for a few months. But it is unlikely Netanyahu’s legal problems will force him to step down any time soon. A sitting prime minister charged with a crime is required to step down only after he has exhausted every legal appeal a process that could take years.An election billboard in Jerusalem shows President Trump with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February. (Photo: Oded Balilty/AP)Still Israelis are in uncharted territory: Even though former Israeli prime ministers have been brought down by legal problems Netanyahu will be the first to be indicted while holding office and he is violating a long-standing norm of resigning in the face of criminal allegations (as his predecessor Ehud Olmert did). Not only has Netanyahu refused to resign but he has tried to delegitimize the inquiry accusing the media of colluding with the legal establishment in order to take him down and blaming the attorney general for giving in to left-wing political pressure — even though he was a Netanyahu appointee. In language that will be familiar to Americans he has called the investigation a “witch hunt.”Meanwhile Netanyahu also faces his most formidable electoral challenge since he was was ousted after his first term as prime minister in 1999 from the centrist Blue and White Party led by Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid. While Lapid is an experienced politician Gantz is a newcomer to politics but he has establishment credentials as a former chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces a common path to political power in Israel. Gantz has been conspicuously tight-lipped about the specific policies he would pursue as prime minister and he has instead run on a broader vision of an alternative to Bibi: In place of right-wing rule he has offered non-ideological pragmatism and in place of Netanyahu’s brash style he has promised restraint decorum and transparency committing himself to ending corruption and healing a society fractured by Netanyahu’s divisive leadership. Furthermore while Bibi has built his career on his reputation for taking a hard line toward the Palestinians and Iran Gantz has relied on his military background — as well as those of other senior leaders of his party such as Moshe Ya’alon and Gabi Ashkenazi who also served as chiefs of staff — to bolster his national-security credentials against Netanyahu and his Likud party.Retired Israeli military chief Benny Gantz left with Yair Lapid head of the Yesh Atid party as they launchtheir new Blue and White alliancefor the upcoming Israeli elections in Tel Aviv on Feb. 21. (Photo: Ariel Schalit/AP)The election is taking place against the background of Israel’s existential effort to chart a future relationship to the Palestinians and with the rest of the Middle East and ongoing demonstrations sporadic violence and even the threat of an imminent war coming from Gaza. Last month in what was widely regarded as an effort to boost his ally Netanyahu Trump declared that the United States would formally recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights a strip of land it seized from Syria in the 1967 war. And just three days before the election Netanyahu announced on television that if reelected he would begin annexing the parts of the West Bank where Israelis have settled — a fateful step that could further isolate Israel at the United Nations.Nevertheless the campaign has largely been fought as a referendum on Netanyahu’s leadership. While his rivals have focused on his legal problems and his polarizing political style Netanyahu has presented himself as a powerful figure on the world stage who after a decade in power has developed close personal relationships with Trump and even Russian President Vladimir Putin which are of immense value to Israel’s national security.The campaign has been exceptionally bitter and acrimonious even by the standards of Israel’s typically cut-throat politics. Gantz and Lapid have seized on a new scandal implicating close associates of Netanyahu ininvolving the purchase of naval vessels from a German ship-builder and the sale of submarines to Egypt and questions about why deals happened without approval from the appropriate ministers. Yet Gantz has also been the subject of several scandals. In March it was revealed that Shin Bet Israel’s internal security service believed Gantz’s phone had been hacked by Iran which raised concerns that Gantz could be blackmailed. And over the course of the election numerous tapes of Gantz speaking in private have been leaked to the public including one in which Gantz said he would consider joining a coalition led by Netanyahu something Gantz now denies he would do.In the April 9 election Gantz’s Blue and White and Netanyahu’s Likud are expected to win roughly the same number of seats in the Knesset although some polls give Blue and White a small edge. But given the proliferation of right-wing parties that may win at least some seats Likud has a better chance of putting together a majority coalition in the Knesset so even if his party comes in second Netanyahu may still serve another term as prime minister.Campaign billboards show Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left alongside the Blue and White party leaders from left Moshe Ya’alon Benny Gantz Yair Lapid and Gabi Ashkenazi in Tel Aviv on April 3.

One question is whether the incoming government will pass an immunity law or what Israelis call the “French law” after a 2001 court ruling that the president of France was immune to prosecution while in office. Right-wing members of the Knesset have so far indicated that they are reluctant to support immunity for Netanyahu but the issue may give them leverage in forming a new government or in pursuing their agenda.The election outcome may also decide the fate of Trump’s long-promised “deal of the century” the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan proposal that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner has been preparing for two years. Some expect the proposal whose details remain largely unknown to arrive shortly after the election.The implementation of a two-state solution and the establishment of a Palestinian state would require Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza territories that it acquired in the course of the 1967 Six-Day War and which Palestinians want for their future state. And while the Trump administration’s plan is widely assumed to call for Israel to make some territorial concessions there are already hints that the proposal will meet widespread resistance in Israel especially by the nationalist parties. One hint that the Israeli right will try to stymie the deal came in February when Kushner gavean interview with Sky News Arabiaand inadvertently spurred a raucous public debate in Israel. His remarks that the conflict was “really about establishing borders” alarmed factions that oppose territorial concessions and were the first indication that the proposal may divide the Israeli public when it is released. The remarks initiated a debate between Netanyahu and the right-wing education minister Naftali Bennett with Bennett accusing Netanyahu of collaborating with both Gantz and Trump and Kushner to implement a “two-state solution” and Netanyahu assuring the public that he opposed a Palestinian state a point about which he has gone back and forth over the years.President Trump with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after signing a proclamation formally recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights at the White House on March 25. (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP)West Bank annexation is another potential obstacle to U.S. peace plans. When Trump recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel last month some in Israel interpreted it as a sign that the United States would tolerate Israel’s annexing territories in the West Bank. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied that the policy set a precedent for other territories seized during the 1967 war but Netanyahu hinted he saw things differently: “When you start wars of aggression you lose territory. Do not come and claim it afterward. It belongs to us” he said to reporters in Israel returning from his meeting with Trump in Washington in which the recognition was made official. “Everyone says you can’t hold an occupied territory but this proves you can. If occupied in a defensive war then it’s ours.”Then came Netanyahu’s announcement of his intention to annex parts of the West Bank if elected — and not just the settlement blocs near the 1967 borders but even remote outposts deep in the West Bank.  “Will we move ahead to the next stage? Yes. I will extend sovereignty but I don’t distinguish between the settlement blocs and the isolated ones because each settlement is Israeli and I will not hand it over to Palestinian sovereignty.” When he was asked if he would evacuate settlers from Israeli settlements in the West Bank if the Trump peace plan required it he said: “That will not be happening. If that’s the [Trump administration’s] plan there will be no plan.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu center Sen.

(Photo: Ronen Zvulun/Reuters)Not all observers took Netanyahu’s statements at face value. Some pointed out they were reminiscent of similar remarks that Netanyahu made in the final days of the 2015 Israeli election when in order to shore up support from his base Netanyahu announced that he opposed the establishment of a Palestinian state only to backtrack in the days after the election. But whatever Netanyahu actually meant his remarks suggest a problem on the horizon for the Trump administration. Ever since Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in December 2017 the Palestinian leadership has categorically refused to participate in U.S.-led negotiations with Israel claiming Trump has forfeited any claim to impartiality. But now despite his  generous concessions toward Israel he may face a right-wing government in Jerusalem that is just as suspicious of any peace plan he puts forward.Ben Manson is a freelance journalist based in Israel and New York.Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because ‘the man lies’Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos’s phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKim Kardashian Doesn't Know If Her Family Will Ever Be Invited Back to 'SNL' After Kanye West's SpeecSecret Service director fired by President TrumS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaA Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaDozens of neglected animals evacuated from Gaza zoAuburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburWhoopi Goldberg Intervenes After Tense Moment Between Meghan McCain and Joy Behar on 'The View'U.S. judge halts Trump policy of returning asylum seekers to MexicKylie Jenner Applauded On Social Media For Learning To Style Daughter Stormi's HaiPHOTOS: MLB Opening Day 201They Say It's Bad Now But Republicans Disclosed Private Tax Returns In 201Chinese woman arrested at Trump's Florida club to remain in custodTest of Last word to Hulu PublisSurvey of 8000 teens could spell bad news for GameStoAllison Mack pleads guilty in Nxivm sex cult case: 'I was wrong'Father allegedly beat 5-year-old daughter to death because she didn't do her homeworPHOTOS: Blaze at high-rise in BangladesKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in Ugand,1

"window.performance && window.performance.mark && window.performance.mark('PageStart');Trump takes ‘unprecedented’ action against IraTrump takes ‘unprecedented’ action against IraWASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Monday that it would officially designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. Officials acknowledged the decision to label a part of a foreign government a terrorist organization was “unprecedented” but framed it as a necessary response to Iranian aggression.“The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror. It exports dangerous missiles fuels conflicts across the Middle East and supports terrorist proxies” President Trump said in a statement released by the White House.Critics including some within the Trump administration have suggested the step could place U.S. troops or intelligence agents in danger of facing similar designations or other forms of retaliation. Indeed shortly after the designation was announcedreported that the Iranian Foreign Ministry asked the country’s president to brand U.S. Central Command as a terrorist organization. It is also unclear how the move could affect businesses in European countries that still engage with Iran.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who is taking the lead on this action announced the move in a news conference Monday morning. He said the designation would take effect “one week from today.”President Trump; Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: AP Ay-Collection/Sipa/REX/Shutterstock)use of terror as a tool of statecraftmakes it fundamentally different from any other government” Pompeo said adding “This historic step will deprive the world’s leading state sponsor of terror the financial means to spread misery and death around the world.”Pompeo cited several examples of “Iran-backed terror incidents” including the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing that targeted U.S. Air Force personnel in Saudi Arabia and an alleged 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador in Washington D.C. The secretary of state pointed to Iran’s “wrongly detaining U.S. persons including some who remain in custody.” Additionally Pompeo noted Iranian support for other groups that America has labeled as terrorist organizations: Islamic Jihad and Hamas in the Palestinian Territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon.A senior administration official who discussed the terror group designation on a press conference call with reporters described it as a longtime goal for Trump.“President Trump has always believed the threat from the Islamic Republic goes beyond its nuclear and missile programs as deadly as they are” said the official who declined to be named.Both Pompeo and the officials on the press call also described the decision as an extension of Trump’s “maximum-pressure campaign” on Tehran which has included sanctions and the decision to pull out of the multilateral nuclear accord with Iran.The Trump administration has been mulling designating the IRGC a terror group for months with Pompeo a strong supporter of the movewhile other officials were concerneit could expose U.S. troops to fallout and retaliation. When asked about this concern the officials on the call emphasized that the move came after an interagency process that included the evaluation of security concerns. They also said curbing the IRGC would benefit U.S. forces abroad.“What endangers American troops among other things is an IRGC that operates with impunity and never has its ambitions checked in the Middle East” an official said.Pompeo also addressed whether the move could lead to financial consequences for European allies.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks at a news conference to announce the Trump administration's plan to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard a ""foreign terrorist organization."" (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)“If you’re the general counsel for a European financial institution today there is more risk. It is absolutely the case that the IRGC amounts to a significant piece of the Iranian economy through pure kleptocracy. And it is also the case that it is sometimes difficult to know whether the IRGC is involved” Pompeo said adding “I think this will require more diligence be done by every business that is considering doing things that are even now second and third orders removed from what you might think of as a traditional connection to the Iranian economy.”Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarifthe Trump administration was considering this move to benefit Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a close ally and staunch opponent of Iran who is facing a tight election on Tuesday. The U.S. official emphasized Trump had hoped to make this designation for some time prior to the announcement.“Our willingness ... to give them plausible deniability just came to a close” the official said of Iran. “This is something the president has long wanted to enact.”Read more from Yahoo News:Preet Bharara considered taping Trump because 'the man lies'Candidates edge toward discussing slavery reparationAs immigration sweeps spread fear activists and sheriffs unite to protect neighborJohn Hickenlooper wants to be the last Democrat standing.Cybersecurity experts urge skepticism over claims Saudis hacked Bezos's phonPHOTOS: Amazing ice caves of IcelanKidnapped American tourist guide rescued by security forces in UgandS&amp;P 500 posts 8-day winning streaA Peter Thiel-Backed Company Would Benefit the Most From Trump's 5G PlaUS pulls forces from Libya as fighting approaches capitaExplainer: Can Democratic subpoenas force the release of Mueller's Trump-Russia report?Auburn gymnast dislocates both knees in horrific accident in her final meePHOTOS: Vibrant Cape Verdean culture draws people to drab Lisbon suburIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not a racist: Former Sen.
