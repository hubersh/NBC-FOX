Once again Hampton Roads braces for battle on aircraft carriers - Daily PresOnce again Hampton Roads braces for battle on aircraft carrierDavid B. Hollingsworth / The Virginian-PiloThe USS Harry S. Truman could be slated for early retirement if the Navy has its way. The ship is shown here returning from deployment in December. (David B. Hollingsworth / The Virginian-Pilot)Two years ago President Donald Trump made a dramatic entrance at Newport News Shipbuilding and promised to expand the aircraft carrier fleet. It was his biggest applause line.That promise appeared to bear fruit in January when the shipyard signed a two-carrier contract with the Navy. It was the first bulk-buy of the nuclear-powered behemoths since the Reagan administration.Now the PentagonÛªs latest proposal has local leaders scratching their heads. The Pentagon wants to mothball the Norfolk-based aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman halfway through its intended 50-year service life.ÛÏItÛªs just very short-sighted what the presidentÛªs budget wants to doÛ said Rep. Rob Wittman R-Westmoreland who pushed for the two-carrier purchase.Navy leaders still plan to expand the fleet. Currently at 289 ships they expect to reach 314 in about five years. The long-range goal is 355 ships although the mix of vessels is still open to debate.But they can save at least $3.4 billion by skipping the TrumanÛªs midlife overhaul a massive upgrade scheduled to begin in 2024. Cancelling the overhaul ÛÓ something thatÛªs never been done ÛÓ would essentially result in the ship being retired early since its nuclear fuel would run out and not be replenished.Making the proposal was ÛÏa very difficult decisionÛ said Rear Adm. Randy Crites but it would allow the Navy to invest in next-generation war-fighting tools. That includes investment in a pair of unmanned surface ships about the size of small Coast Guard cutters.That trade-off doesnÛªt hold water with Rep. Elaine Luria D-Virginia Beach. The former Navy commander along with Wittman sits on the influential sea power subcommittee of the House Armed Services which will hear from Navy leaders next week.ÛÏIf something breaks out in the world I donÛªt think the president turns to the secretary of defense and says Û÷Where are my unmanned surface vessels?Ûª He says Û÷Where are my aircraft carriers?Ûª Û she said.Craig Quigley is the executive director of the Hampton Roads Military and Federal Facilities Alliance. Like others he was caught by surprise by the PentagonÛªs proposal to skip overhaul formally known as a Refueling and Complex Overhaul or RCOH.ÛÏI just donÛªt understand the logic unless itÛªs cost avoidanceÛ he said. ÛÏIf that trumped everything else well then I guess I at least understand the proposal. I just donÛªt think itÛªs a strategically smart decision.ÛThe Navy wonÛªt save much money over the short term by skipping the RCOH said Bryan Clark a retired naval officer and analyst with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.ÛÏI donÛªt think itÛªs a good trade-offÛ he said. ÛÏThe technology the Navy is trying to buy now isnÛªt helped by the canceling of the Truman (overhaul.)Another argument against the move focuses on taxpayer investment. The Truman was built to last 50 years but would only serve for 25.ÛÏThey will save $3.4 billion but will lose the investment of 25 yearsÛ said Vinod Agarwal an economist at Old Dominion University. ÛÏIt simply does not make economic sense.ÛThe Newport News shipyard a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries is the sole designer and builder of nuclear-powered carriers for the Navy. It is also the only shipyard capable of handling the RCOH.Lasting several years the overhaul results in a completely refurbished ship and provides business for thousands of suppliers across the country.RCOH schedules are tightly coordinated. As one ship leaves another is supposed to arrive. Skipping a RCOH creates problems at the shipyard which is VirginiaÛªs largest industrial employer.Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he does not expect employment to suffer because the two-carrier contract would compensate for loss.ÛÏPart of the calculus here was to maintain employment. In fact with (this) decision we grow employment in the industrial baseÛ he told a Senate panel last week. ÛÏWe want to make sure that not only the shipyards maintain their employment thereÛªs actually growth but also (growth in) the supply chain.ÛHII spokeswoman Beci Brenton did not specifically address employment but said the RCOH cancellation would be felt well beyond the shipyard and the aircraft carrier program.Saving money by skipping the job comes with a cost.ÛÏIt will decrease what we buy and order from our base of 680 vendors in 40 states and will drive costs significantly higher on several Navy shipbuilding and maintenance programsÛ she said in an email.A reported proposal to mothball a Norfolk-based aircraft carrier halfway through its 50-year service life is already drawing fire from key members of Congress.wants to skip the midlife overhaul of the USS Harry S. Truman scheduled to begin around 2024...Key lawmakers from both parties have lined up against the proposal. The Navy shipbuilding budget will get a full airing next week in hearings before the sea power panels in both the House and Senate armed services committees.Rep. Joe Courtney D-Conn. who chairs the House sea power panel has already signaled his skepticism along with Wittman and Luria who is the vice chairman.ÛÏI think IÛªm not going to be moved by the prospect of unknown untested technologies and unmanned surface vehiclesÛ Luria said. ÛÏItÛªs kind of backwards to say weÛªre going to build the thing then figure out what to do with it.ÛHampton Roads has been down this road before.In 2013-14 Congress considered early retirement of the USS George Washington instead of going through with its RCOH. At the time the Navy was dealing with across-the-board budget cuts but Congress opposed the move and the Obama White House eventually put in the extra money.Aircraft carriers make tempting targets for budget-cutters because of the expensive price tag. The newest carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford costs about $12.9 billion.ÛÏIf youÛªre looking for real money to get to some of these other mission areas IÛªm not going to get there by trimming around the edgesÛ Quigley said. ÛÏIÛªve got to go where the money is.ÛEven if the Truman proposal is scuttled expect Congress to debate the future of aircraft carriers for years to come. Many factors will drive the discussion.The U.S. already has far more carriers than any other country. Military experts have questioned the vulnerability of the ships. China is developing long-range weapons that could force carriers to stay farther offshore making it more difficult for their fighter jets to reach their targets.Clark the naval analyst sees the Truman debate as a strategic move driven largely by Pentagon leaders who doubt the effectiveness of carrier-based aircraft in any fight against China..They accepted the two-carrier purchase while not being sold on the future of carrier air power in that corner of the globe.ÛÏAs long as there are questions among leaders in (the Pentagon) about the viability of the carrier air wing this will be an issueÛ he said.Quigley said he doesnÛªt underestimate what China is developing but carrier defenses have evolved too.ÛÏSuch is the nature of naval warfareÛ he said.ÛÏWe shouldnÛªt look at a carrier as being uniquely vulnerableÛ she said. ÛÏItÛªs really the most survivable airfield in the world.ÛThe Aircraft Carrier USS Abraham Lincoln departs Naval Station Norfolk.

"Biden and the Problem of Touch | RealClearPoliticBiden and the Problem of ToucBiden and the Problem of ToucBiden and the Problem of ToucVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...""If I profane with my unworthiest han""This holy shrine the gentle sin is this:""My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stan""To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.""-- William Shakespeare. ""Romeo and Juliet"" Act I SceneJoe Biden's explanatory video in response to stories of his sometimes overly exuberant physicality was well-played. He seemed relaxed sincere unscripted and above all not supine.The matter of physical touch is well touchy. One person's affectionate hug is another's creepy unwelcome invasion of personal space. Biden does seem to have stepped over the line at times. Free advice: Inhaling the aroma of a woman's hair and kissing her head when you've just met is not recommended. But most of the time it seems that Biden's hugs shoulder rubs and Eskimo kisses were well-received. He is physically demonstrative with women but also with other men and particularly with children.""Social norms are changing"" Biden acknowledged assuring viewers that he ""gets it."" But before we close the books with the #MeToo-inflected conclusion that touching is ""problematic"" we might want to consider some other evidence currently in the news that suggests we aren't touching enough.According to the General Social Survey the huge study of America's cultural patterns that has been conducted for decades Americans are having less sex now than they did 30 years ago. Some of that is the consequence of an aging population. But even among Americans aged 18-29 nearly a quarter reported that they had been celibate for the previous year compared with 14 percent in 1989.It is well-known that married adults have more sex than single divorced or even cohabiting adults and that married people report higher levels of both sexual satisfaction and happiness. The trend away from marriage thus virtually guarantees that more people will be isolated and vulnerable to the diseases of loneliness which include drug and alcohol abuse. Marriage rates are plunging for those with only a high school degree or some college and though college graduates have high rates of marriage they tend to marry later in life. That leaves many young adults without romantic partners. And it turns out that screens make very poor substitutes.There is no delicate way to say this: Screens can deliver orgasms but they are completely unable to provide the other benefits of human contact. People who are not romantically involved or who lack close friends or family are also missing out on the kind of touches that Biden sometimes inappropriately delivered -- back rubs head kisses hand-holding and bear hugs.There is a wealth of psychological literature showing that skin-to-skin contact is critical for the normal mental development of human infants. All but the most fragile preterm babies do better when cuddled in their mothers' arms than in incubators. Studies have shown that babies in Romanian orphanages who were provided with nutrition and clean diapers but were rarely held or spoken to grew into emotionally stunted children.In childhood too physical contact is critical for children's wellbeing. When fathers roughhouse with their young children the kids are better able to regulate their emotions including aggression and are found to be more popular with their peers than children who lack this kind of play.Our need to touch and be touched never subsides. Chronic loneliness has been found to be as harmful to health as smoking. Studies have found that hugs don't just relieve stress and release oxytocin (the bonding hormone); they can also reduce susceptibility to the common cold lower blood pressure and diminish pain. And when humans pet animals both experience physiological benefits. Even just holding hands with a loved one while enduring a painful medical procedure has been found to make the experience more bearable. When close couples hold hands their heart rates and brain waves tend to synchronize.Most of us just aren't designed to live the kind of solitary lives that excessive entanglement with technology is encouraging. We are social and also tactile creatures. Our recent social trend away from marriage and toward silicone companions is the equivalent of taking people away from a roaring fireplace surrounded by loved ones and placing them in solitary steel and glass pods. Let's not lose sight of our affective natures even as we police the excessively handsy amongst us.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
Kaine proposes &amp;apos;Medicare-X&amp;apos; health insurance plan - Daily PresKaine proposes 'Medicare-X' health insurance plaSenator Tim Kaine right makes a point while giving a speech at the University of Louisville Monday April 1 2019 in Louisville KY. On left is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Pat McDonogh/Courier Journal via AP) (Pat McDonogh / AP)Ûªs network of doctors and hospitals could make coverage affordable for Americans now priced out of the market Sen.The Virginia Democrat and Sen. D-Colo. are trying again with their ÛÏMedicare-XÛ idea of offering a government-run health insurance option.Because the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services donÛªt need to earn a profit market  coverage or pay the high salaries private insurers give executives Kaine said Medicare-X policies would likely cost 10 to 15 percent less than those currently on offer through theBut the idea is that Medicare-X would offer the same benefits as Obamacare policies ÛÓ including pediatric and obstetrics care not currently covered by Medicare. As with Medicare and the Obamacare policies people with pre-existing conditions could not be denied coverage.The bill also echoes an initiative offered by Rep. Robert C. ÛÏBobbyÛ Scott D-Newport News and other senior House Democrats ÛÓ offering people with incomes exceeding 400 percent of the federal poverty line subsidies for their coverage.In addition Kaine and Bennet propose capping premiums for Medicare-X coverage depending on income.

The lower premiums would require smaller subsidies than do current Obamacare policies.Bennet said the idea is to take a practical step toward covering uninsured Americans adding that he did not see Medicare-X as either a first step to other DemocratsÛª ÛÏMedicare for allÛ plans ÛÓ supported by several 2020 presidential candidates ÛÓ or as a rejection of those ideas.He and Kaine propose introducing Medicare-X by 2021 in areas where there is currently only one private insurer offering Obamacare coverage expanding it to the rest of the country by 2024 and offering it as an option for small businesses seeking coverage for employees by 2025.An earlier version gained little traction in 2017 and while the idea of a ÛÏpublic optionÛ was floated for the Affordable Care Act it never made it to the final version that became law in 2010.Jimmy Carter ss now the longest-living US President.

The House has voted to end American involvement in the Yemen war rebuffing the Trump administration's support for the Saudi-led military campaign. The bill goes to President Donald Trump who's expected to veto it.(Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP file)ÛÒ The House on Thursday voted to end American involvement in the Yemen war rebuffing the Trump administrationÛªs support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia.The bill now heads to President Donald Trump who is expected to veto it. The White House says the bill raises ÛÏserious constitutional concernsÛ and Congress lacks the votes to override him.By a 247-175 vote Congress for the first time invoked the decades-old War Powers Resolution to try and stop a foreign conflict.ÛÏThe president will have to face the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its constitutional obligations when it comes to foreign policyÛ said Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel of New York chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He said the humanitarian crisis in Yemen triggered by the war ÛÏdemands moral leadership.ÛThe war is in its fifth year. Thousands of people have been killed and millions are on the brink of starvation. The United Nations has called the situation in Yemen the worldÛªs worst humanitarian crisis.The top Republican on the committee Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas acknowledged the dire situation in Yemen for civilians but he spoke out in opposition to the bill saying it was an abuse of the War Powers Resolution.ÛÏThis radical interpretation has implications far beyond Saudi ArabiaÛ McCaul said. He warned that the measure could ÛÏdisrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 counties.ÛOpposition to the Saudi-led war in Yemen gathered support last year in the aftermath of the killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The Washington Post columnist was killed in October by agents of the kingdom a close U.S. partner while he was in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. U.S. intelligence agencies and lawmakers believe that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of Khashoggi who had written articles critical of the kingdom.Lawmakers from both parties have scrutinized U.S.-Saudi ties and criticized Trump for not condemning Saudi Arabia strongly enough.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/04/house-ends-support-yemen-war-rebuffs-trump/39298669/,0

First he said it was his choice to push off the health care votes. Then he said he never expected there to be any votes at all until after 2020.Trump claimed Wednesday he had never intended to reopen old wounds. But in keeping the issue at the forefront the president put fresh attention on the GOPÛªs long-running and thus far unsuccessful effort to end ACA.ÛÏI was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me &amp; the Republican PartyÛ Trump tweeted adding ÛÏI never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election.ÛThatÛªs not how congressional Republicans including Senate Majority Leader McConnell understood TrumpÛªs sudden shift to the issue last week.The GOPÛªs bitter internal fight over health care in 2017 remains a sore subject for the president. He often retells the story of the late Arizona Sen. John McCainÛªs ÛÏnoÛ vote that killed the repeal-and-replace effort. Republicans hit hard on health care issues during the 2018 midterm election had no plans to take up the issue again before the next one.TrumpÛªs fight was on display when he told Republican senators last week that his White House was developing a plan to replace the Obama health law. The sudden move stunned GOP leaders on Capitol Hill. While Trump wanted them to become ÛÏthe party of health careÛ they feared it could be for all the wrong reasons if they were forced into a do-over of the tough votes.McConnell on Tuesday issued a rare public disclosure of his private counsel to the president warning that another health care fight would be politically costly and doomed to fail now that Democrats control the House. The usually tight-lipped leader said afterward that the president agreed to shelve his health care push until after the campaign.ÛÏI made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the SenateÛ McConnell told reporters Tuesday.Facing a court deadline Trump seized on health care last week  backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act. TrumpÛªs motivations were as political as they were legislative mindful that Republican unfulfilled promises to ÛÏrepeal and replaceÛ the Obama-era law stand as a glaring failure of his administration. He didnÛªt want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly.ÛÏWeÛªre going to keep the presidency and weÛªll vote in the best health care package weÛªve ever hadÛ Trump said.Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days. After Trump said last week he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act McConnell faced a revolt from the ranks.McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care ÛÒ namely trying to lower prescription drug prices according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call. But TrumpÛªs promised big new health care bill wasnÛªt going happen with Democrats running the House. Instead Trump could focus on the issue during the election.Trump told McConnell he ÛÏacceptedÛ the situation and ÛÏwould be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign.Û That night Trump tweeted as much.McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking ÛÏMedicare for AllÛ proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking.Associated Press writers Zeke Miller Laurie Kellman Alan Fram Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar Darlene Superville and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/trump-health-care/39293731/,0

"White Supremacy Must Be Undone | RealClearPoliticWhite Supremacy Must Be UndonWhite Supremacy Must Be UndonWhite Supremacy Must Be UndonVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- The national debate on race -- which the president has made more angry and urgent with his racial demagoguery -- is hindered by imprecise language.Most whites do not feel personally guilty for America's long history of imposed white supremacy. A white man who has lost his job at the coal mine or the daughter of a recent Ukrainian immigrant probably does not regard himself or herself as privileged. And they are not likely to have an emotional investment in the debates over race that have dominated American history.For a certain kind of conservative this is the end of the story. The oppressors of blacks in the past are dead. Their grandchildren and great-grandchildren in this view can't be held responsible for sins they did not commit.America's racial dialogue is distorted by the use of the word ""guilt."" To most people guilt involves a conscious personal decision to engage in some wrong. But this situation is more complex. Whether they realize it or not white people in America benefit from centuries of enforced white dominance. And their current indifference helps perpetuate the social and economic advantages that have resulted.What is important is not the feeling of guilt -- though many of us might benefit from taking an honest inventory of our personal prejudices. What is important is a recognition that our economic and social systems have been massively rigged in favor of whites and that the unrigging is a continuing political responsibility.Examining American history for evidence of oppression is a disturbingly easy task. Even a skim reveals a thick layer of scum.The great rigging began about 400 years ago when around 20 slaves were brought to Jamestown. The white settlers wrote laws that placed slaves and indentured servants in different categories -- allowing poor whites to be slave overseers and permitting black slaves to be punished more harshly. Virginia's colonial government determined that baptism would not confer freedom on slaves -- effectively allowing some Christians to own other Christians. Across the colonies slavery began to be associated with skin color.Many Christians employed the Bible to defend slavery but in the late 18th century some Enlightenment science also purported to prove black racial inequality. The American Constitution did not recognize the full personhood of African Americans. One of the early acts of the new republic was to restrict citizenship to white males. In 1854 the California Supreme Court invoked a California state law that said ""no black or mulatto person or Indian shall be allowed to give evidence in favor of or against a white man."" In 1857 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that blacks have ""no rights which the white man was bound to respect.""Slavery itself involved physical and psychological violence on a massive scale designed to prevent men and women from considering and organizing opposition. Marriage and education were restricted or forbidden families were routinely separated and slaves could usually be beaten raped or killed with impunity.While slavery eventually ended economic and political oppression did not. White supremacy was written into Jim Crow laws and enforced by continued public and private violence. Voting rights were systematically denied. ""Sundown towns"" made it illegal for blacks to remain after dark. And nearly 4000 lynchings revealed the evil at the heart of dehumanization. Sometimes thousands of white men women and children would gather to watch the event. In some cases fingers of the victim were cut off as souvenirs. Unborn children were ripped out of wombs. Corkscrews were used to tear out flesh. Men and women were beaten and burned to death. And photographs of the victims were turned into postcards.The list continues. Redlining and restrictive covenants undermined black homeownership. Unions were permitted to lock nonwhites out of better jobs. Educational integration was resisted by segregation academies. Equal justice was resisted by white juries. And some churches gave their blasphemous blessing.In all this racism is not primarily a matter of human feelings. It is the systematic use of political economic social and religious structures to ensure white supremacy. And no response is serious that does not take the reform of structures seriously.This does not lead directly to a specific policy. Conservatives and liberals will naturally disagree about how to close the wealth gap between African Americans and whites. (The average wealth of white households is about seven times greater than that of black households.) But such inequality is not a matter of bad feelings. It was consciously and purposely built into institutions over centuries. And it must be consciously and purposely undone.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Is Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden? | RealClearPoliticIs Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden?Is Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden?Is Bernie Behind the Attacks on Biden?Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...There was always something fishy about the #MeToo complaint against Joe Biden. Putting hands on Lucy Flores' shoulders and smooching the back of her head is in no way sexual. Even Flores admitted that.Nonetheless Flores gave a dramatic rendition of the distress it caused her. ""I just froze"" she said. ""I didn't know what to do. Because again the only thing that you're processing is that there is a very powerful man standing next to you ... and you just don't know how to respond.""What doesn't add up? Everything.Flores was not a preadolescent nymph but rather the 2014 Democratic nominee for Nevada lieutenant governor. If a kiss on the back of her head made her freeze how would she have responded to a genuine crisis say a terrorist attack? She was about to go on stage so you'd think she had other things on her mind. Then-Vice President Biden was doing her an enormous favor bestowing his prestige on her candidacy. And if this bothered her so much why did she wait five years to ""come forward""?The most plausible answer is that this stunt isn't about Biden but about helping Bernie Sanders. Lo and behold polls show Biden leading Sanders among Democratic voters -- as Sanders faces his own accusations of disrespecting women.Some backstory: When Flores lost the 2014 election by a landslide establishment Democrats stopped promoting her. (Two years later she lost a primary run for Congress.)In 2016 she joined the Sanders campaign becoming a surrogate. She also joined the board of Our Revolution an advocacy group backing Sanders.Biden advisers share the hunch that the Sanders campaign is behind her charges according to Mike Allen of Axios. And a former Sanders staffer Tezlyn Figaro just called Flores a ""fraud"" on Fox News.We expect that in the future Biden will desist from getting so affectionate with women and will lose the grandfatherly touch. A politician should not do unto women that which he would not do unto men.But let's look at Sanders' lamentable record on women. Women who worked on the 2016 campaign complain that they were made subservient to the boy geniuses. And there was that unforgettable moment when the Bernie bros hurled the C-word at Democratic women running the Nevada State Democratic Convention. Sanders responded to the use of that vilest of words against women with the mildest of hand slaps. Then he blamed both sides. (The official statement has been removed from his website.)Because everyone is delving into Biden's beliefs of decades ago consider Bernie's. In 1969 he opined that sexual maladjustment was linked to breast cancer. ""You might very well be the cause of cancer"" he wrote with his trademark air of authority. Even back then mainstream science rejected theories that psychological factors caused cancer.Sanders also found fault with mothers unhappy that their 16-year-old daughters spent a night out with their boyfriends. ""Are you concerned about HER happiness"" he wrote ""or about your 'reputation' in the community?"" In this worldview not putting out is an emblem of female repression.Zoom to 2019. Sanders says he believes Lucy Flores as do a number of other opportunistic Democrats. Thing is we all believe Flores' account of what Biden did. Videos show Biden hugging kissing and rubbing shoulders of numerous women over the years.What we can't believe is Flores' claim that she is bringing this up now to fix a grievous wrong done her -- rather than an innocent gesture by a national politician who went out of his way to help her campaign. That Sanders and his people are fueling these petty attacks is something we can believe.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

The otherÛªs a boyish 46-year-old native of the U.S.-Mexico border city of El Paso Texas who livestreams his skateboarding prowess and offers hopeful but vague paeans to tolerance and cooperation.Bernie SandersåÊandåÊBeto OÛªRourkeåÊmay represent different poles among the dozen-plus Democrats vying for the White House but they have key commonalities that now inject special tension into their rivalry as they ramp up their campaigns.Both lead the pack in fundraising and haveåÊbuilt substantial campaign treasuries on thousands of small donorsåÊnationwide rather than using the more traditional model of a small core of major financial backers.They also strike chords with the same part of the electorate. In their last races each rose on a strong appeal to young voters.Now though itÛªs not clear both can exploit their strengths while going head-to-head.Already they find themselves recruiting some of the same campaign talent with a few veterans of SandersÛª 2016 presidential bid having signed on this time with OÛªRourke.While other candidates in the 2020 race have natural connections to other parts of the Democratic voting base Sanders a U.S. senator and OÛªRourke a former congressman could find themselves in more of a zero-sum contest for the same turf. Both will be in Iowa this weekend campaigning for the upper hand.ÛÏIf Bernie begins to surge the Beto people will largely go there. The oppositeÛªs true tooÛ said Jim Hightower a former Texas agriculture commissioner who was a top state Sanders supporter in 2016 but also among the first to counsel OÛªRourke on his near-upset in November of Sen. Ted Cruz.This week Sanders announced that he raised $18.2 million in 41 days of campaigning through March 31. OÛªRourke countered that heÛªd collected $9.4 million in an 18-day period or $520000-plus daily.Matt Bennett co-founder of the Third Way a centrist Washington think tank said Sanders finds himself more hemmed in than when he ran a surprisingly tight race in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.ÛÏHe has plenty of competition in the authenticity category nowÛ including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Indiana who also have attracted strong online fundraising.Still Bennett said OÛªRourke may prove the stiffest test to Sanders given that his donor base is so similar ÛÓ a key metric for campaign strength so early in the electoral cycle.ÛÏWhat youÛªre going to see is there is not a clean ideological explanation for where people end upÛ Bennett said. ÛÏItÛªs going to be who speaks to me who inspires me with their rhetoric with their persona with their passion.ÛOther major candidates in the Democratic presidential field ÛÓ which includes two African Americans a half dozen women a Latino and a gay candidate ÛÓ have obvious inroads with key ethnic racial and demographic groups that lean Democratic.But Sanders and OÛªRourke have shown they can consistently draw throngs of young voters to their rallies.SandersÛª crusty passion ÛÓ and willingness to fight for policy ideas that seemed far-fetched even if it wreaked havoc on both parties ÛÓ appealed to 2016 voters who were sometimes less than a third his age.OÛªRourke who was still in high school when Sanders entered Congress in 1991 has whipped up enthusiasm by preaching optimistic bipartisanship to meet challenges like climate change.TexasÛª 2018 midterms ÛÓ which included OÛªRourkeÛªs Senate race ÛÓ drew nearly 1.1 million voters between ages 18 and 29 or 235% more than the stateÛªs midterms in 2014 in no small part due to his campaign.As the nationÛªs population gets older young voters are seen as increasingly important to Democratic candidates.ÛÏThe Democratic PartyÛªs age profile is really defying the aging pattern of the country overallÛ said Alec Tyson of the Pew Research Center which specializes in election analysis. ÛÏTheyÛªre about as young as they were 10 years ago which is remarkable because the countryÛªs not.ÛPew data indicates that millennial voters born between 1981 and 1996 have had a Democratic tilt since reaching adulthood.In the early weeks of his campaign OÛªRourke has prioritized visiting colleges. HeÛªs impressed some previous Sanders supporters with the 30-year gap between them.ÛÏI think itÛªs really important to get people excited and I think thatÛªs what Beto does and IÛªm not sure Bernie does anymoreÛ said Meaghan OÛªConnor 21 a Sanders voter in 2016 who attended an OÛªRourke campus rally at Penn State University last month.Both Sanders and OÛªRourke have worked to reach other demographic groups. Sanders has recalled his days as a civil rights activist at the University of Chicago and OÛªRourke has made three visits since 2017 to historically black Texas Southern University in Houston.Despite having overlapping strengths OÛªRourke and Sanders are different politically.OÛªRourke is more establishment-minded promising to work with Republicans and appeal to past Donald Trump supporters. His message that relies more on optimism than specifics reminds some of Barack ObamaÛªs 2008 pitch.Sanders specializes in specificity best illustrated by his ÛÏMedicare for AllÛ health care plan calls for $15 hourly minimum wage and proposals to shrink large investment banks.ÛÏBlindly following Beto for his personality is a bad thingÛ said Travis Clark a 23-year-old University of Texas student who saw OÛªRourke at a recent Austin rally but remains undecided. ÛÏYou have to vote for the candidate for the right reasons not just because you like them.ÛLog In with your RCMG Accoun,0
"Zuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free Expression | RealClearPoliticZuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free ExpressioZuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free ExpressioZuckerberg's Plan for the Internet Would Be a Disaster for Free ExpressioVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In a recent op-ed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg implored the state to get more involved in governing the internet. ""Every day we make decisions about what speech is harmful what constitutes political advertising and how to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks"" he said. ""These are important for keeping our community safe. But if we were starting from scratch we wouldn't ask companies to make these judgments alone.""For starters there's no such a thing as ""harmful speech."" There might be speech that offends us. There might be speech we disagree with. There's also speech that's inarguably ugly dishonest pornographic or despicable. Yet ""we"" allow these unpleasant words to go largely unregulated because we value the broader liberty of being able to offer opinions without government censors dictating which thoughts are acceptable.Then again if Zuckerberg wants to rid his platform of this ""hate speech"" no one is stopping him. Facebook allegedly employs a number of new mechanisms to achieve this very task. Good luck.But Zuckerberg claims that ""we"" as society have a special responsibility to facilitate his efforts to keep people ""safe"" from reprehensible rhetoric. We have no such obligation. Facebook already offers users the ability to block or ignore accounts they find distasteful. If they don't like how Facebook is governing speech and interactions they can quit.What Zuckerberg's plan does however is undermine competition. If a company like Facebook sets speech codes that are too stifling for users another innovator will jump into the gap and create a platform that offers consumers what they seek. While I assume free political expression isn't the predominate concern of most social media users it does exist. When government sets a ""baseline"" for what's acceptable there's no longer any competition for open debate.Worse deliberation over free expression would be moved to the political arena where the influence of scaremongering officials ideologues and rent-seeking tech corporations like Twitter Facebook and Google would dominate decisions.""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech and frankly I agree"" Zuckerberg writes. It's true that the skewed manner in which social media companies regulate political speech is already hurting them. Many conservatives have rightly grumbled about the double standards employed by social media giants. Yet do they really believe handing over Facebook's speech codes to censors is going to yield better results for open debate in the long run? Do they not remember that the Citizens United decision was the result of bureaucrats attempting to ban political speech? Do they not remember what how easy was for IRS officials tasked as arbiters of political speech to abuse their power? Have any of them seen a state's civil rights commission in action?Empowering political appointees to codify the meaning of ""hate speech"" on the internet would surely result in mission creep and a push to make unpopular topics off-limits -- things like ""transphobia"" or ""Islamophobia"" come to mind but there are an array of other topics on both sides of the ideological divide.Moreover Zuckerberg wants to institute these plans in ""common global framework."" Well Vladimir Putin recently signed a bill that makes it a crime to ""disrespect"" the state and spread ""fake news."" France who Zuckerberg says is already working with Facebook has passed hate-speech laws that allow the banning of political content. The same is true for many other nations. And let's not forget fully authoritarian nations like China. Are those the countries that Zuckerberg trusts to assist the United States in instituting a framework for acceptable internet speech?Further Zuckerberg contends that we need speech codes to protect our ""elections."" There's nothing wrong with our elections -- other than Donald Trump's victory rankling Democrats. There are of course already laws that make it illegal for Facebook to accept money from foreign nations attempting to inject themselves into U.S. elections.In a disorderly and widely accessible internet it is impossible to stop them every time. Any crackdown on alleged ""fake news"" -- one of the evils of the internet according to Zuckerberg -- can easily be manipulated to target inconvenient speech. If the Russian collusion episode should teach us anything it's that fake news isn't always what it seems to be. And liberals might note that Trump's definition of ""fake news"" doesn't mesh with their own either.In the end having an occasional amateurish fake news piece drop into your social media feed is far preferable to having a censor deciding what constitutes appropriate news.Like every crony capitalist who's ever tried to get government to do his job for him Zuckerberg is attempting to both extricate himself from the responsibility of running his site and attempting to hurt the competition. That's not surprising. In this case however the consequences go beyond mere rent-seeking.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist. Follow him on TwitterLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Palin responded ""They're our next-door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska from an island in Alaska.""In a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit comic Tiny Fey mocked Palin in this exchange with comic Amy Poehler who portrayed Hillary Clinton.Fey as Palin: ""You know Hillary and I don't agree on everything ...""Poehler as Clinton: ""Anything. I believe that diplomacy should be the cornerstone of any foreign policy.""Fey as Palin: ""And I can see Russia from my house.""Two things: First there are places in Alaska where one can in fact see Russia. A Conde Nast travel website put it this way: ""You could argue that this bit of cartographic trivia didn't make Palin an authority on geopolitics but it's factually correct: Russia and Alaska are close enough to make eye contact. On a clear day you could climb a hill on Cape Prince of Wales and maybe make out mainland Siberia just fifty miles away."" Not close enough? Alaska's Little Diomede Island in the Bering Sea lies within easy eyeshot of Big Diomede Island part of Siberia and the easternmost point of Russia. The two islands are separated by the international date line and a mere 2 miles of ocean.Second Palin never said ""I can see Russia from my house."" University of Georgia's Michael Cacciatore co-authored a research paper called ""Misperceptions in Polarized Politics: The Role of Knowledge Religiosity and Media."" About Palin's Russia comment Cacciatore writes:""Almost three-quarters of the American population falsely attributed the statement to Palin. And much of the blame it appears goes to late-night political comedies such as 'The Colbert Report' and 'The Daily Show.' After controlling for other factors including demographics and media use heavy viewers of late-night TV comedy had a (higher) probability of believing that Palin was the first to say 'I can see Russia from my house.' ... Perhaps more alarming neither knowledge nor traditional news media use helped correct this misperception related to Palin. In fact heavy traditional news media users were nearly 14 percentage points more likely than light users to think Palin was responsible for the quote.""This brings us to President Donald Trump a current victim of the Palin Effect. Trump stands accused of an allegedly ""racist"" reaction to the 2017 tragedy in Charlottesville Virginia where a white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd killing one and injuring several others. Many insist Trump downplayed the horror of the Charlottesville tragedy by supposedly stating there were ""good white nationalists and bad white nationalists"" or ""good neo-Nazis and bad neo-Nazis"" at the rally.CNN's Don Lemon while covering a story on the recent mass shootings in New Zealand said ""Nobody has forgotten -- nobody has forgotten -- what he [Trump] said after that deadly white supremacist riot in Charlottesville."" Lemon played an edited clip of Trump saying: ""You also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did."" Similarly Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel referred to Trump's Charlottesville response to blame him for the Jussie Smollett hoax. Emanuel said: ""The only reason Jussie Smollett thought he could take advantage of a hoax about a hate crime is for the environment -- the toxic environment -- that Donald Trump created. This is a president who drew a moral equivalency between people who are trying to perpetuate bigotry and those who are trying to fight bigotry. ... When you go back to Virginia this is a person who said and I quote 'There are good people on both sides.'""The problem is that TrumpIn his widely misquoted press conference three days after Charlottesville Trump said there were ""very fine people"" on ""both sides"" of the issue of whether it is appropriate to display Confederate monuments in pubic locations. Here is what Trump said: ""Excuse me they didn't put themselves down as neo-Nazis and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group -- excuse me excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name."" In case there was any doubt Trump in response to another question said ""I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists becausethey should be condemned totallThe question becomes Why are so many Democrats and members of the media seemingly unaware of what Trump really said?

Debbie Dingell speaks as Rep. Barbara Lee D-Calif. left and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee D-Texas second from right listen at a news conference after the House voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act Thursday on Capitol Hill in Washington.ÛÓ In an unusual display several Republican lawmakers shouted down Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell on Thursday as she spoke on the House floor about reauthorizingåÊthe Violence Against Women Act.The National Rifle Association hadurged lawmakers to vote against the biloveråÊa gun-reform provision by Dingell to include convicted stalkers and convicted abusers of current or former dating partners among thoseåÊprohibited from purchasing or owning firearms.""DoåÊnot let the NRA bully you!"" Dingell said directing her remarks to the GOP side of the chamber and raising the memory of her husband former Rep. John Dingell Jr. who died in February.""Don't forget who I was married to. John Dingell was on the NRA board. Hell he helped start it.""All this does ÛÓ we are not taking away due process. All we are saying is if someone has been convicted (of abusing) an intimate partner then they would not have access to a gun. If someone has been convicted of stalking. I would say to all of you ÛÓ""As the Dearborn Democrat spoke a rising chorus of male members on the GOP side shouted that Dingell's time to speak was up interrupting the remainder of her remarks.Her allotted time had expired but Dingell kept trying to speak over the warnings of the chair.""You know what? You can't shout down a woman"" Dingell retorted.-- speaking on behalf of Violence Against Women Act reauthorization -- urges members to ""not let the NRA bully you"" Republicans shout her down.""You know what? You can't shout down a woman!"" she says.She was speaking against a Republican procedural motion toåÊsubstitute the underlying legislation with an extension of the current Violence Against Women Act excludingåÊ Dingell's provision and other updates.Rep. Elise Stefanik R-New York contended that only a ""clean"" extension of the law would pass muster in the Republican-controlled Senate.""This extension gives Republicans and Democrats time to work together to pass a truly bipartisan long-term reauthorization of VAWA just like Congress has done many times before"" Stefanik said.The Democrats' legislationåÊ""politicizes"" VAWA and ""could put women girls and children at potential risk in the future"" she said.""Voting no on this motion to recommit means you are voting to end the Violence Against Women Act and instead knowingly voting for a partisan bill that will never see the light of day in the Senate"" Stefanik said to her colleagues' applause.""It will collect dust in the Senate"" she added.But Dingell argued the GOPåÊextension was too short ""incomplete"" and threatened to undermine the statute noting it left out rape-testing funds and anti-child abuse training.The House ultimately rejected the Republican motion and voted 263-158 to pass the reauthorization including Dingell's measure with 33 Republicans joining Democrats in support.Before she was shouted down Dingell delivered an emotional speech on the House floor referring to her own experience with domestic violence growing up.""I remember what it was like when you called the police and they didn't come because your father was an important man in town. I remember what it was like when someone on our college campus was raped and the police came to them and said 'It's your fault' and would do nothing"" Dingell said.""And I don't want anyone in this House to forget that Michigan State UniversityåÊwas only brought to the forefront last year whenåÊhundreds of victims tried to tell people something was happening and nobody would listen. We cannot go back to those days.""Dingell said after the vote that she would fight to pass the legislation in the Senate.""I was in the moment. And in case you couldn't tell I spoke from my heart"" she said.""Preventing domestic violence and sexual assault against women should never be politicized"" Rep.

Trump Backs off Border Shutdown but Threatens Auto Tariffs | RealClearPoliticTrump Backs off Border Shutdown but Threatens Auto TariffTrump Backs off Border Shutdown but Threatens Auto TariffTrump Backs off Border Shutdown but Threatens Auto TariffVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON (AP) ÛÓ Abandoning his threat to immediately seal the southern border President Donald Trump warned instead that heÛªd slap tariffs on cars coming to the U.S. from Mexico unless the Mexicans do more to stop the flow of migrants and drugs to the U.S.In his latest backtrack in recent days Trump told reporters Thursday he would try the ÛÏless drastic measureÛ before resorting to his standing border-closure threat.ÛÏMexico understands that weÛªre going to close the border or IÛªm going to tariff the cars. IÛªll do one or the other. And probably start off with the tariffsÛ Trump said. He added later: ÛÏI donÛªt think weÛªll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Mexico at 25 percent will be massive.ÛIt was the latest seemingly sudden attempt at new leverage by a president struggling to solve what his administration has called a border ÛÏcrisis.Û And it was a dramatic departure for Trump who last week tweeted that he would close the border or large swaths of it this week unless Mexico immediately halted ÛÏALL illegal immigration coming into the United StatesÛ ÛÓ a seemingly impossible task.Trump said at the time that he was ÛÏnot kidding aroundÛ and his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in a television interview Sunday that it would take ÛÏsomething dramaticÛ for Trump not to close down the crossings.Since then however White House advisers border city leaders and U.S. economists have warned that such a move would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border interrupting supply chains and boosting U.S. consumer prices on everything from avocadoes to autos.Trump in recent days has also backtracked on his push for Republicans to again take on health care and surprised his own education secretary by reversing a plan to ax federal aid for the Special Olympics.Those actions have only added to longstanding concerns about whether TrumpÛªs words can be trusted. Trump who has long said his unpredictability is one of his greatest negotiating assets has also followed through with some of his most bombastic threats including forcing the countryÛªs longest-ever government shutdown over border funding.Trump had already appeared to be easing off his border threat earlier this week. Though he said Tuesday all options remained on the table he shifted his goal posts calling on Congress to pass immigration legislation to avert a closure and praising the Mexican government for doing more to apprehend migrants traveling through the country from Central America ÛÓ though itÛªs unclear anything has changed.Marcelo Ebrard MexicoÛªs foreign relations secretary said Tuesday his government had not changed its policies. And on Thursday MexicoÛªs ambassador to the U.S. Martha Barcena told The Associated Press the country was working to make its own border ÛÏmore orderlyÛ but ÛÏmigration will never be stopped.ÛJesus Seade the Mexican undersecretary for North America also brushed off the threat of new tariffs saying officials were ÛÏnot concernedÛ and noting the tariffs are not part of the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement that the countries have agreed to but not yet ratified.On Thursday Trump also threatened tariffs if Mexico doesnÛªt halt the flow of illegal drugs across the border saying heÛªd give the country ÛÏa one year warningÛ to comply.ÛÏBut if in a year from now drugs continue to pour in weÛªre going to put tariffs onÛ he said adding: ÛÏI donÛªt play games.ÛAs for concerns his actions might interfere with the trade deal he fought for Trump said the border was ÛÏmore important to me than the USMCA.ÛTrump has wide-ranging power to impose tariffs on national security grounds which he has repeatedly used as leverage against other countries. But the USMCA was worded to protect Mexico against auto tariffs based on national security concerns and trade lawyer Daniel D. Ujczo said those provisions are already in effect under a side letter.ÛÏIn short this is the exact scenario that the Mexican negotiating team predicted and secured protections from in the USMCAÛ he said. ÛÏMexico Û÷Trump-and-Tweet-proofedÛª its auto sectorÛ and the White House ÛÏwould need to get very creative to impose auto tariffs on Mexico.ÛIn addition despite what Trump suggests Mexico China and other American trading partners donÛªt pay U.S. tariffs directly. American importers pay the tariffs at the border and then must decide how much of the higher cost they can pass along to U.S. customers.Tariffs do squeeze the manufacturers who export to the U.S. from foreign countries by making their products more expensive in the United States. But there again that can hit U.S. companies such as General Motors which is a major car-maker in Mexico.Trump has been increasingly exasperated at his inability to halt the swelling number of migrants entering the U.S. including thousands who have being released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100000 arrests or denials of entry in March a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children who require extra care.The presidentÛªs ÛÏpretty frustratedÛ said Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas who spoke with Trump this week and offered to work with the administration ÛÏto try to come up with some more targeted ideasÛ including changes for remittances to Mexico. Trump suggested he work with the Treasury secretary on the idea Cornyn said.Trump has invoked other executive powers including declaring a national emergency in an effort to secure more money for his long-promised border wall. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed that measure.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that Democrats would file a lawsuit aimed at preventing Trump from ÛÏstealingÛ billions from federal programs and diverting the money to building barriers along the border.Administration officials had been studying ways to minimize the economic impact of a potential border closure in case Trump went through with his threat including keeping trucking lanes open or closing only certain ports.But even absent that extraordinary step delays at border stations have been mounting after some 2000 border officers were reassigned from checking vehicles to deal with migrant crowds.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

She did not take any questions from the media.The president announced NielsenÛªs would ÛÏbe leaving her positionÛ after 16 months on the job on Sunday evening. Nielsen took over leadership of the Department of Homeland Security after Trump appointed former DHS Secretary John Kelly to be White House chief of staff. Kelly has since resigned from that post.Trump also announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would replace Nielsen as acting secretary tweeting: ÛÏI have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!ÛLater Nielsen tweeted that she had submitted her resignation.ÛÏIts[sic] been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov.

The Associated Press reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help to deal with the growing number of families crossing the border.Administration officials told Fox News on Sunday that NielsenÛªs background in cybersecurity made her a poor fit to handle border issues while McAleenan best fits TrumpÛªs requirement of being the ÛÏtoughest copÛ on the frontier.Sources told Fox News that Nielsen had been viewed as resistant to some of the immigration measures pushed by the president and his aides specifically related to protected status for some refugees and policies at the border.A senior administration official told Fox News that National Security Adviser John Bolton long felt that Nielsen was not the right person for the job and opposed her policy of using United Nations organizations to try to stem the flow of illegal migrants. The official added that Bolton and Kelly had a heated disagreement over NielsenÛªs approach during an October 2018 policy meeting after which Bolton went to Trump to protest what Nielsen was doing.KEVIN MCALEENAN NEW ACTING DHS BOSS HAS LONG RECORD IN BORDER SECURITOnce Kelly left the White House at the end of last year Nielsen&amp;apos;s days appeared to be numbered.

"Republicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' Signs | RealClearPoliticRepublicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' SignRepublicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' SignRepublicans on CNN MSNBC Wear 'Kick Me' SignVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Although the Democratic National Committee has not allowed Fox News to host a Democratic primary debate since 2004 the DNC recently made a show of boycotting Fox for the 2020 presidential cycle.Some conservatives have expressed outrage over this slight but another question is why havenÛªt Republicans taken similar steps against CNN and MSNBC? In November 2015 I wrote a column ÛÏA debate that will live in infamyÛ which excoriated CNBC for its sneak attack on the top 10 Republican candidates for president at the time. That column (reprinted in) called the debate a ÛÏblatant attempt to manipulate public opinion by insulting the standard-bearers of the Republican Party.ÛI donÛªt think Fox News would sink quite that low if it were permitted to host a Democratic debate but then IÛªm not a Democrat. It should be obvious to everyone however that Republicans have not learned the lesson to be wary of the left-wing media.An interview of Hogan Gidley on ""MSNBC Live With Hallie Jackson"" last week was the latest case study in how stupid it is for any Republican for any conservative and especially for any Trump supporter to ever appear on a network like MSNBC (or as should be obvious CNN).Of course I'm not breaking news here when I say that but as a journalist I keep hoping reporters will treat the people they interview with respect and fairness and make all their subjects feel equally at ease and/or nervous regardless of political affiliation.That's certainly not what I witnessed last Tuesday when Jackson mauled (er interviewed) Gidley deputy press secretary for President Trump (seen at 11:45 of this). I kept hoping Gidley would push back his chair and walk off the set in disgust but I knew that if he did it would just be click bait for Democratic trolls and late-night hacks (er comedians). Once you make the mistake of handing matches to the angry mob you have no choice but to stand patiently until they finish burning you at the stake.Gidley probably knew he made a mistake as soon as Jackson introduced him by saying that he had ÛÏdeigned to join us here on set.Û He acknowledged her insult by saying dryly ÛÏI do deign.ÛJackson began by grilling Gidley about whether the White House would turn over to Rep. Elijah Cummings information related to how security clearances were granted to 25 people. (A White House mole er Deep Stater had given the list to Cummings in a ploy to create a post-Russia distraction.) Although it was clear after the first time the question was answered that the White House was not going to cooperate with Cummings' fishing expedition for some reason Jackson could not absorb this information. She asked the question a second time then a third on each occasion implying that Gidley was not answering her question which he plainly was.ÛÏThis precedent would make it possible for members of Congress anytime they want to make a political point and play political games to bring that [confidential] information forward. That is absolutely ridiculous and weÛªre not gonna play that gameÛ Gidley said to Jackson who then pretended that heÛªd dodged the question.It was at this point that I started to reflect on the fact that Jackson was no longer a reporter but rather a Democratic operative. Being aggressive is a good trait in a reporter. Being the devil's advocate is a necessary tool of being a good interviewer. But I could not recall any instance in recent memory where a reporter on MSNBC had used the same tactic against a Democrat.After moving on from the security-clearance issue Jackson claimed that President Trump had reversed course (or ÛÏpuntedÛ) on Obamacare. The president had said he wanted Congress to replace Obamacare which a federal judge had ruled to be unconstitutional but he later explained that a vote would not come until after the 2020 election. This confused members of the media including Jackson who donÛªt understand that the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats who wonÛªt vote with the president to replace Obamacare. Gidley calmly explained the issue and said what Trump wants to accomplish but Jackson kept arguing with him.She also accused both Trump and Gidley of lying. She claimed the president said he was ÛÏjust kiddingÛ about health care. He didnÛªt. When she started talking about aid to Puerto Rico she said the president was lying about how much aid has been pledged to that beleaguered island. ÛÏThese are things that are not trueÛ she said repeating Democrat talking points as if they were the gold standard for objective truth. (If you believe that I have a secret Russian dossier I want to sell you!)The coup de grace though came later when Jackson saved the final segment of the interview for shaming Gidley for having misspoken earlier by calling Puerto Rico a country rather than a territory. Generally a good reporter will just correct an interview subject by letting them know that they had misspoken. In this case Gidley apologized and said it was a ÛÏmistakeÛ which Jackson then characterized as ÛÏa slip of the tongue.Û This gave her the opening she was looking for.ÛÏDo you think thatÛªs a concern that there is that kind of slip of the tongue inside the White House?Û she said.ÛÏNo that was a slip of the tongueÛ Gidley patiently explained. ÛÏItÛªs not on purpose Hallie. That would by definition be a slip of the tongue.ÛAs the interview ended I hoped that Gidley had learned his lessonåÊ ÛÓ a lesson that Steve Bannon tried to instill in the Trump White House two years ago when he called the mainstream media ÛÏthe opposition party.Û But unfortunately this is apparently a hard lesson to learn. The president continues to allow himself to be interviewed by the New York Times and Hogan Gidley will probably be back on MSNBC within the month.Rhetoric about the ÛÏdishonest mediaÛ aside as long as Republicans show endless patience with the left-wing media they will continue to ÛÏdeignÛ to be made to look like fools.Frank Miele the retired editor of the Daily Inter Lake in Kalispell Mont. is a columnist for RealClearPolitics.

Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White House | RealClearPoliticOhio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White HousOhio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White HousOhio Rep. Tim Ryan Is Latest Democrat Seeking White HousVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...COLUMBUS Ohio (AP) ÛÓ Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan jumped into the 2020 presidential race on Thursday portraying himself as a candidate who can bridge DemocratsÛª progressive and working class wings to win the White House.Ryan 45 announced his primary bid on ABCÛªs ÛÏThe View.Û He plans a kickoff rally on Saturday in downtown Youngstown where a big turnout by organized labor is expected.The congressman resisted being labeled a political centrist by the talk showÛªs hosts who pointed out that heÛªs a recreational hunter with past backing from the National Rifle Association. In 2015 he reversed his past opposition to abortion in favor of abortion rights.ÛÏIÛªm a progressive who knows how to talk to working class people and I know how to get elected in working class districts because at the end of the day the progressive agenda is whatÛªs best for working familiesÛ Ryan said.DuringåÊan unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy PelosiåÊas House Democratic leader in 2016 Ryan criticized the party for supporting leadership that represents the U.S. coasts at the expense of the middle of the country.Ryan represents the district formerly held by the late Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant for whom he worked. The blue collar areaåÊswung strongly for Donald TrumpåÊover Hillary Clinton in 2016.Bringing those voters back into the fold will be critical in 2020 said Mahoning County Democratic Chairman David Betras. He said that TrumpÛªs victory hinged on 77000 working class votes in four states and that he had a ÛÏnews flashÛ for the Democratic National Committee: ÛÏIÛªm willing to bet weÛªre going to win California and New York (with our current strategy) but can we win Michigan Pennsylvania Iowa Wisconsin and Ohio? IÛªm not so sureÛ he said.The president of the Mahoning-Trumbull AFL-CIO Labor Council Bill Padisak said many of the lifelong Democratic voters in the area who defected to vote for Trump a Republican would return to the Democratic Party for the right candidate.ÛÏIt seemed more like an anti-Hillary vote (in 2016)Û he said. ÛÏBut based on the presidentÛªs performance a lot of people regret it. TheyÛªre like Û÷No this wasnÛªt what I wanted in a president.ÛªÛThough the Iowa caucuses are still nine months away Ryan is getting a late start on theåÊgrassroots fundraisingåÊthat is necessary to qualify for the summer debate stages.The Democratic National Committee is limiting thoseåÊfirst two debatesåÊto 20 slots. To qualify candidates must reach 1% support in at least three reputable early state or national polls or collect contributions from at least 65000 donors with a minimum of 200 each in 20 states.Some Democratic donors are contributing to multiple candidates to help them make sure they donÛªt miss out on the debates. But that threshold is no guarantee in such a wide field. Missing the debate stage ÛÓ and the opportunity to notch a standout moment or two alongside better-known candidates ÛÓ would almost certainly doom a longshot candidacy for someone like Ryan.Ryan has served in Congress since 2003. Before that he spent two years in the state Senate.Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said Ryan canÛªt win.ÛÏYou can just add him to the long list of liberal candidates demanding government-run health care and it underscores how radical and out of touch this Democratic field truly isÛ he said.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

What They Just Did To Try And Hurt Trump Is Absolutely UNFORGIVABLE!The Washington Post has completely sold out any reliability and credibility they ever had. They continue to push fake news and write stories purely so they will damage President Trump and they have yet to face any consequences.They are up there with CNN when it comes to fake news and that is saying something.And as bad of stuff as they have done so far what they just got caught doing is worse than any of their fake stories but thankfully people were watching for them to make a mistake and caught their lying.The Washington Post changed a headline on a story of immigrants dropping food stamps to turn it into an anti-Trump story.Here is a before and after of the headlines.It canÛªt be any more obvious that this. They intentionally edited the headline to make it sound like a hunger protest when in reality it was immigrants trying to evade deportation knowing that the government has their address through the food stamp program.The other very important thing to take into account here is that the only people that should be worried about deportation are those that entered the country illegally and they shouldnÛªt be living off of our tax dollars to begin with.So in reality this Washington Post story is only showing that finally illegal immigrants know they will be deported because we have a president that doesnÛªt hand out taxpayer money with a bow to them.The Washington Post just keeps diving lower and lower into the swamp and it couldnÛªt be any more obvious.It is a good thing that illegal immigrants are stealing our tax dollars but apparently The Washington Post and the Democrats donÛªt see it that way.Share this everywhere to make sure no one believes The Washington Post ever again!Alex only wants freedom to reign so he tries to achieve that the best way he knows how by sharing news.The Trump Effect Is Real!

The move alsoåÊallows the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with material support or prosecute them for sanctions violations.In a statement Trump said the unprecedented move ÛÏunderscores the fact that IranÛªs actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments.ÛHe warned: ÛÏIf you are doing business with the IRGC you will be bankrolling terrorism.åÊThis action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences.ÛPOMPEO VOWS TO PILE ECONOMIC POLITICAL PRESSURE ON IRAAdministration officials have said the step will further isolate Iran and make clear that the U.S. won&amp;apos;t tolerate Iran&amp;apos;s continued support for rebel groups and others that destabilize the Middle East.""The IRGC&amp;apos;s active support for terrorism is unacceptable and the Department of Justice continues to support the administration&amp;apos;s efforts to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its actions"" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.The designation howeveråÊmay also have widespread implications for American personnel and policy in the region and elsewhere as Iran has threatened to retaliate.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APIt will also complicate diplomacy. Without exclusions or waivers to the designation U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move does not allow contact with foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel.

The payment mechanism was similar to agreements MLB has with leagues in China South Korea and Japan.In exchange the Cuban federation had agreed to release all players aged 25 and older with at least six years of professional experience.Rubio: I won't diplomatically recognize Cuba as presiden2016 GOP candidate says he would reverse 'one-sided deal' and strip embassy titlIn the letter which was made public Monday afternoon the Treasury Department told MLB that the payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation constituted illegal business with the Cuban government. That reverses a ruling made by the Obama administration allowing the payments.U.S. law prohibits virtually all payments to the Cuban government under the 60-year embargo on the island but MLB argued the Cuban Baseball Federation which oversees all aspects of the sport on the island was not formally a part of the Cuban state.Opponents called that argument ridiculous given the tight control the highly regimented government maintains over virtually every aspect of life in Cuba.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS AP""The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society"" National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement. ""The Administration looks forward to working with MLB to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents and not as property of the Cuban State.""""We stand by the goal of the agreement which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba"" an MLB statement said.Without a formal path from Cuba to the major leagues hundreds of top players have left the island for good many making harrowing crossings on rafts and rickety boats in the years before Cuba abandoned a hated exit permit requirement for most of its citizens.White House targets Cuba Venezuela and NicaraguNational Security Adviser John Bolton brands the countries a 'troika of tyranny' while announcing new sanctions over human rights violations and political oppression.While such dangerous escapes were mostly eliminated with greater travel freedoms players still needed to cut ties with Cuban baseball and often their families and hometowns going years without returning after signing with the major leagues.""The deal with Major League Baseball is an attempt to stop human trafficking encourage cooperation and elevate the level of baseball"" the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter. ""The politically motivated attacks on the deal hurt players their families and fans.""Last week the Cuban federation released a list of 34 players eligible to sign contracts with major league clubs. The players were aged between 17 and 25 years classified as international amateurs under MLB rules and eligible to sign minor league contracts. No likely stars were apparent on the list but more notable players included 22-year-old Raidel Martinez Perez and 23-year-old LivÌÁn Moinelo Pita who have played professionally in Japan; 17-year-old infielder Loidel ChapellÌ_ Zulueta; and 18-year-old pitcher Norge Carlos Vera Aldana.Fox News&amp;apos; John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignÛª with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed. å©2019 FOX News Network LLC.

President Donald Trump's administration is preparing to designate the Revolutionary Guard as a ""foreign terrorist organization."" It's an unprecedented move that could have widespread implications for U.S. personnel and policy in the Mideast and elsewhere. U.S. officials say an announcement is expected Monday.(Photo: Vahid Salemi / AP file)ÛÒ President Donald Trump announced Monday that the U.S. is designating IranÛªs Revolutionary Guard a ÛÏforeign terrorist organizationÛ in an effort to increase pressure on the country that could have significant diplomatic implications in the Middle East.It is the first time that the U.S. has designated a part of another government as a terrorist organization.The designation imposes sanctions that include freezes on assets the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may have in U.S. jurisdictions and a ban on Americans doing business with it.ÛÏThis unprecedented step led by the Department of State recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a State Sponsor of Terrorism but that the IRGC actively participates in finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraftÛ Trump said in a statement.Iran has threatened to retaliate for the decision.The IRGC is a paramilitary organization formed in the wake of IranÛªs 1979 Islamic Revolution to defend its clerically overseen government. The force answers only to IranÛªs supreme leader operates independently of the regular military and has vast economic interests across the country.The designation allows the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with material support or prosecute them for sanctions violations. That could include European and Asian companies and businesspeople who deal with the GuardÛªs many affiliates.It will also complicate diplomacy. Without exclusions or waivers to the designation U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move does not allow contact with foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel. Those concerns have in part dissuaded previous administrations from taking the step which has been considered for more than a decade.The department currently designates 60 groups such as al-Qaida and the Islamic State and their various affiliates Hezbollah and numerous militant Palestinian factions as ÛÏforeign terrorist organizations.Û But none of them is a state-run military.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/trump-pressure-iran-branding-guard-terror-group/39315971/",0

Richard Neal asked the IRS to provide six years of TrumpÛªs personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses.ÛÏThat is not going to happen and they know itÛ Mulvaney told ÛÏFox News Sunday.Û Asked whether he believes Democrats would ever view the presidentÛªs returns Mulvaney replied: ÛÏOh no never. Nor should they.ÛLast week Massachusetts Democrat Neal one of only three congressional officials authorized to request tax returns requested TrumpÛªs personal and business returns in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. He asked for returns covering 2013 through 2018. He also asked for the documents in seven days setting an April 10 deadline.An obscure 1924 statute includes no exceptions to NealÛªs authority to ask the Treasury Department for returns and says the department ÛÏshall furnishÛ them when requested. It does require that the review of an individualÛªs return be conducted by members of Congress in ÛÏclosed executive sessionÛ if the returns are provided without the taxpayerÛªs consent.Still Mulvaney claimed the law provides for lawmakers to review individual tax returns but ÛÏpolitical hit job is not one of those reasons.Û His comments echoed those made by TrumpÛªs lawyers who argued the Democratic request ÛÏwould set a dangerous precedentÛ if granted.Trump broke with precedent when he chose not to release any tax returns as a presidential candidate. Mulvaney tried to cast the issue of the presidentÛªs taxes as old news saying it was ÛÏalready litigated during the electionÛ and the American people ÛÏelected him anyway.ÛTrump has said he wonÛªt release the information because he is under audit something he reiterated again Friday while visiting the U.S-Mexico border.ÛÏIÛªm under audit. When youÛªre under audit you donÛªt do itÛ Trump said.IRS officials have said taxpayers under audit are free to release their returns. Trump claimed at a news conference following his election in November 2018 that the filings are too complex for people to understand.William Consovoy whose firm was retained by Trump to represent him on the matter said in a letter Friday to the Department of TreasuryÛªs general counsel that the tax code zealously guards taxpayer privacy. He said requests for tax returns ÛÏmust have a legitimate legislative purpose.ÛNeal has said he made the request to review the IRS policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents saying ÛÏlittle is known about the effectiveness of this program.ÛÛÏOn behalf of the American people the Ways and Means Committee must determine if that policy is being followed and if so whether these audits are conducted fully and appropriatelyÛ Neal said when unveiling his request for TrumpÛªs returns.Utah Sen. Mitt Romney the GOPÛªs 2012 presidential nominee who has been an occasional critic of TrumpÛªs called DemocratsÛª actions ÛÏmoronic.ÛHe told NBCÛªs ÛÏMeet the PressÛ that he believes Trump should release his tax returns but by demanding them ÛÏI think the Democrats are just playing along with his handbook.ÛRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/07/trump-taxes-mulvaney/39312515/,0

"The Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like Brexit | RealClearPoliticThe Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like BrexiThe Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like BrexiThe Irish Border Is Illogical - Just Like BrexiVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...DUBLIN -- Last week I drove across the Republic of Ireland in under 15 minutes.Okay I cheated a little. Starting in Belleek at the far western tip of Northern Ireland I made for the Fairy Bridges of Bundoran located on the Atlantic Ocean only 8.5 miles away. I was exploiting a quirk in the border a narrow strip of land along the west coast that keeps the majority-Catholic county of Donegal connected to the rest of the republic. So it wasn't much of a feat ... but it does make for a good story.This trip was possible only because the Irish border is so illogical. That illogicality in turn makes its centrality to the Brexit debate perfectly sensible -- and makes for a good story.The boundary is the legacy of England's brutal 17th-century colonization of Ireland's Ulster region which left Catholics and Protestants too intermingled to be separated by any clean political boundary and too mutually antagonistic to comfortably share the Home Rule. The solution -- carve out the six majority protestant counties from the rest of Ireland -- didn't really solve the problem.Nonetheless Northern Irish Catholics and Protestants currently enjoy an uneasy truce a process the European Union assisted by blurring the border to invisibility. I discovered just how invisible when I prepared to commemorate my passage into the republic -- and realized I was already there. The only visible transition had been a slight difference in road signage.But Brexit looms and behind it the specter of a harder more visible border. And so British Prime Minister Theresa May has desperately tried to find some compromise among at least five parties each of whom can't or won't give up the one thing some other party must have.Catholic nationalists in Northern Ireland understandably resent living on their ancestral lands as an ethno-religious minority. They're opposed to border checkpoints even a friendlier version run by the Irish government.I found out just how intense the opposition is about five minutes after pulling into Keady. A pugnacious older gent told me he'd removed the last checkpoints on the Armagh border after Northern Ireland's Good Friday peace agreement in 1998 -- and didn't doubt that the younger lads would tackle the next ones. A January car bombing in Derry indicates that some nationalists may already be getting a jump-start on the Troubles 2.0.But if Brexit happens the E.U. won't consent to a gaping hole in its borders. Unless Britain hews to E.U. rules Ireland which will remain in the E.U. must have something like a border somewhere -- either with the United Kingdom or with the E.U. Which leaves the Irish government with a conundrum. Ireland walling itself off from the E.U. to maintain a connection with Northern Ireland would defeat the purpose of E.U. membership. But it's neither practical nor politically acceptable for the Irish government to actively reharden the border with Northern Ireland.May could of course break the Brexit stalemate either by ceding the E.U. the control it wants or carving Northern Ireland off into its own regulatory zone. But Protestant Unionists are adamant that there can be no separate regime for Northern Ireland because damn it they're British. The 10 Democratic Unionist Party members of Parliament are also the linchpin of May's parliamentary majority.Unfortunately that majority also depends on pro-leave members who insist that U.K. voters voted ""Leave"" not ""Downgrade to nonvoting membership in the E.U."" Pursuing Brexit in name only risks both the May government's democratic legitimacy and an irreparable split in her party.No compromise can possibly satisfy all these reasonable intransigent demands. And so on Wednesday the prime minister crossed a hard border of her own: She sat down with Jeremy Corbyn the leader of the Labour Party to explore a cross-party compromise. With enough Labour votes May could bypass the DUP and the Brexiteers and make enough concessions to Europe to keep the Irish border open.It's hard to overstate how amazing the May-Corbyn meeting was the political equivalent of peace talks between cat and mouse. Corbyn isn't just the opposition leader; he's a socialist radical. Cooperating with him would split May's party down the middle -- and thereby possibly hand him the keys to her office.Taking this step illustrates just how impossible it was to secure compromise within her own majority. And that's the Irish border in a nutshell making humdrum things such as ""compromises"" considerably more difficult -- and less likely -- than startling impossibilities such as driving across a nation in 15 minutes.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

It Shouldn't Have Had To.Congress Is Right to Subpoena the Mueller Report. It Shouldn't Have Had To.Congress Is Right to Subpoena the Mueller Report. It Shouldn't Have Had To.Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee should not have had to vote Wednesday to subpoena special counsel Robert Mueller's report. It should already have been sent to Congress. The fact that the body's Democrats had to take this forcing action underscores why Attorney General William Barr's handling of the document so far is irresponsible -- and yes suspicious.Let's look at the timeline. Mueller submitted his report March 22. Two days later on March 24 Barr issued his four-page letter that included not one complete sentence from the report. Barr quoted the report as saying: ""[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."" Note that the quote leaves out the beginning of the original sentence.And note also that Barr's own words said Mueller ""did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia."" The phase ""did not establish"" is not the same as ""did not find"" but we have no way of knowing absent the report itself how significant that difference is. What we do know is that Barr seems to have put the best possible spin for Trump on what Mueller himself wrote.Indeed The New York Times reported Wednesday evening that there is dissatisfaction on the Mueller team with Barr's account.""Some of Robert S. Mueller III's investigators"" the paper reported ""have told associates that Attorney General William P. Barr failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry and that they were more troubling for President Trump than Mr. Barr indicated.""Yet another reason why Congress and the public need to see the real thing.And The Washington Post reported that ""some members"" of Mueller's team ""were particularly disappointed that Barr did not release summary information the special counsel team had prepared."" Barr needs to release those summaries too and be asked why he didn't make them public in or with his March 24 letter.On obstruction Barr quoted the Mueller document saying that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime it also does not exonerate him."" Then Barr made an astonishing assertion: ""The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime."" Barr who had already criticized what he took to be Mueller's theory on obstruction before he became attorney general went on (surprise surprise) to absolve the president writing ""that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""But wait a minute: Did Mueller's decision not to make a call mean that it was Barr's decision to make? There is nothing that automatically gives Barr that power. Perhaps Mueller intended to leave the decision on obstruction to Congress not to Barr. Maybe Mueller was silent on this issue in his report. Maybe he wasn't. We can't know because we haven't seen the report.And then came a strange letter from Barr on March 29 in which he complained that many were ""mischaracterizing"" his March 24 letter.""My March 24 letter was not and did not purport to be an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel's investigation or report. ... I do not believe it would be in the public's interest for me to attempt to summarize the full report or to release it in serial or piecemeal fashion.""So a summary was not a summary and his first letter was well incomplete or at least not ""exhaustive"" or ... well what was it? A news release? President Trump certainly had no problem crying from the heavens that Barr's letter was a good-enough summary for him and that it cleared him of everything.Which means that looking at everything Barr is doing with a suspicious eye is at this point the only safe thing to do. Especially when Trump who had previously said he had no problem releasing the report complained on Tuesday that it was a ""disgrace"" that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. was now demanding the very sort of disclosure the president had once endorsed. Trump it would seem was for releasing the full report before he was against it.When the committee voted for the subpoena on Wednesday Nadler said: ""The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct. That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves -- not the attorney general's summary not a substantially redacted synopsis but the full report and the underlying evidence."" In light of everything that has happened since Mueller turned in his report on March 22 how could Congress settle for anything less?(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

A ""fundamental"" purpose of tax law Mulvaney continued is to protect the privacy of tax filers.""If they don&amp;apos;t get what they want in the Mueller report they&amp;apos;re going to ask for the taxes"" Mulvaney said. ""If they don&amp;apos;t get what they want in the taxes they&amp;apos;re going to ask for something else.

We&amp;apos;re under audit despite what people said and we&amp;apos;re working that out -- I&amp;apos;m always under audit it seems but I&amp;apos;ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name you&amp;apos;re audited. But until such time as I&amp;apos;m not under audit I would not be inclined to do that.""One of the president&amp;apos;s personal lawyers later wrote a forceful four-page letter to the Treasury Department to oppose the Democrats&amp;apos; requestsaying it would set a ""dangerous precedent.""WHAT DID TRUMP ATTORNEY SAY IN LETTER OPPOSING DEMS&amp;apos; TAX RETURN DEMAND?The request Wednesday by Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee wasåÊthe first such demand for a sitting president&amp;apos;s tax information in 45 years. The move setåÊup a virtually certain legal showdown with the White House.Neal made the request in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig asking for Trump&amp;apos;s personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. Neal told Rettig that Democrats have a duty ""to ensure that the Internal Revenue Service is enforcing the laws in a fair and impartial manner.""ÛÏIt is critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officials"" Neal said in a statement. ""To maintain trust in our democracy the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly as laws intend.""Neal specifically demandedåÊthe federal income tax returns from eight entities including Trump National Golf Club-Bedminster as well as statements specifying whether the returns were ever under audit. Neal also demanded all administrative files including affidavits related to each return.Also on Sunday Ways and Means committee member Dan Kildee D-Mich. backed up Neal&amp;apos;s request.President Trump says border wall is needed now more than ever to stop 'colossal surge' of migrantTrump talks immigration and border security during tour of border wall construction; Kristin Fisher reports from Calexico California.""It is not up to President Trump to determine whether or not this coequal branch of government has the tools available to it to make the deliberations necessary in order to make policy"" Kildee told ABC News&amp;apos; ""This Week"" on Sunday.And speaking later to Hemmer Rep.åÊBen Ray LujÌÁn D-N.M. saidåÊthat Trump had promised to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential campaign.""This is not political""åÊLujÌÁn insisted.The president&amp;apos;s congressional allies registered immediate and fierce disapproval to Neal&amp;apos;s request throughout the week. The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee Kevin Brady R-TexasåÊwrote to Treasury SecretaryåÊSteven MnuchinåÊto decry what he called Democrats&amp;apos; ""abuse"" of their authority.ÛÏWeaponizing our nationÛªs tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens Americans&amp;apos; privacy rights As you know by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns"" BradyåÊsaid in the letter.åÊÛÏThis particular request is an abuse of the tax-writing committeesÛª statutory authority and violates the intent and safeguards of Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code as Congress intended.ÛThatåÊprovision of tax lawåÊgenerally prohibitsåÊthe disclosure of personal tax information.Brady wroteåÊthat while ""transparency in our government is enormously important"" the ""privacy and freedom"" of all taxpayers is paramount -- and that Congress should pass new disclosure laws if it sees a problem.

"Ex-US Sen Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina dead | Fox NewEx-US Sen Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings of South Carolina deaErnest F. ""Fritz"" Hollings the silver-haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U.S. Senate has died. He was 97.Family spokesman Andy Brack who also served at times for Hollings as spokesman during his Senate career said Hollings died early Saturday.Hollings whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination retired from the Senate in 2005 one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South.He had served 38 years and two months making him among the longest-serving senators in history.Nevertheless Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term. The senior senator was Strom Thurmond first elected in 1954. He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history.SENATE REPUBLICANS ENACT PROCEDURAL CHANGE TO SPEED CONFIRMATION OF TRUMP JUDICIAL PICKIn his final Senate speech in 2004 Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election calling money ""the main culprit the cancer on the body politic.""""We don&amp;apos;t have time for each other we don&amp;apos;t have time for constituents except for the givers. ... We&amp;apos;re in real real trouble.""Hollings was a sharp-tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped.He sometimes blamed that failure on his background rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation.However South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s.Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958. He built a national reputation as a moderate when in his farewell address as governor he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University.""This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina&amp;apos;s choice a government of laws rather than a government of men"" he told lawmakers. Shortly afterward Clemson was peacefully integrated.In his 2008 autobiography ""Making Government Work"" Hollings wrote that in the 1950s ""no issue dominated South Carolina more than race"" and that he worked for a balanced approach.""I was &amp;apos;Mister-In-Between. The governor had to appear to be in charge; yet the realities were not on his side"" he wrote. ""I returned to my basic precept ... the safety of the people is the supreme law. I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed.""In the Senate Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers. He chaired the Commerce Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees.But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble. He once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum D-Ohio the ""senator from the B&amp;apos;nai B&amp;apos;rith"" and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen. Alan Cranston D-California as ""wetbacks.""Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.SEN. KAMALA HARRIS CO-SPONSORING BILL TO LET DREAMERS BE CAPITOL HILL INTERNEarly in his Senate career he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina one of the poorest states in the union.Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory.Hollings who made three trips to the war zone said he learned a lesson there.""It&amp;apos;s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time"" he wrote in his autobiography warning that America is now ""repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq.""Despite his changed views Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government.In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities helping lay the groundwork for the Women Infants and Children or WIC feeding program.A year later his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book ""The Case Against Hunger.""In 1982 Hollings proposed an across-the-board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid.He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act. Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm-Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget.Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq.In his later years port security was one of his main concerns.As he prepared to leave office he told The Associated Press: ""People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment. I never ever lived that way. ... I&amp;apos;m not trying to get remembered.""He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law.Hollings&amp;apos; one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen. Olin Johnston. After Johnston died Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44 winning the first of his six full terms two years later.Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston South Carolina on Jan. 1 1922. His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression.Hollings graduated from The Citadel the state&amp;apos;s military college in Charleston in 1942. He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II. Back home he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947.The next year he was elected to the state House at age 26. He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36.As governor he actively lured business helped balance the budget for the first time since Reconstruction and improved public education.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignÛª with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed. å©2019 FOX News Network LLC.

"2020: Socialist America or Trump's America? | RealClearPolitic2020: Socialist America or Trump's America?2020: Socialist America or Trump's America?2020: Socialist America or Trump's America?Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In the new Democratic Party where women and people of color are to lead and the white men are to stand back the presidential field has begun to sort itself out somewhat problematically.According to a Real Clear Politics average of five polls between mid-March and April 1 four white men -- Joe Biden Bernie Sanders ""Beto"" O'Rourke and Pete Buttigieg -- have corralled 62 percent of all Democratic voters.The three white women running -- Senators Elizabeth Warren Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand -- have together a piddling 8 percent.The lone Hispanic candidate Julian Castro is at 1 percent.African American candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker fare better with Harris at 10 and Booker at 3.Who has raised the most money from the most contributors?Sanders is first with $18 million; Harris is next with $12 million; Beto is third with $9 million in 18 days; and ""Mayor Pete"" is fourth with $7 million.Warren Klobuchar and Gillibrand have yet to file reports.But the big takeaway from recent weeks is the sudden stunning vulnerability of the front-runner. Seven women have come forward to berate Biden for unwanted and offensive touching and crowding. Joe is on the defensive. Some in the #MeToo movement want him gone.He is also being slammed for decisions across his 36-year Senate career -- opposing busing for integration deserting Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas hearings supporting a racially discriminatory crime bill voting to authorize George W. Bush to take us into war in Iraq.And unkindest cut of all: Barack Obama's stony silence about Joe's candidacy.The most compelling case for the 76-year-old ex-vice president is that he can win back Trump's white working-class voters and return Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Democratic fold.Thus a major drop in Biden's polls could be terminal to his candidacy.If Biden can't guarantee a victory over Trump why go with Joe?Yet if he fades away as a candidate as he has done twice before who emerges as front-runner? The 77-year-old Socialist Bernie Sanders. If Joe fades Bernie and the comrades will have removed the last large roadblock to a socialist takeover of the national Democratic Party.And what would then happen if the Democrats simply held the House added three Senate seats and defeated Trump in 2020?An all-out effort to abolish the Electoral College that is integral to the historic compromise that created our federal Union. Puerto Rico and D.C. would become states giving Democrats four more Senators and making America a bilingual nation.A drive would be on to give 16-year-olds and convicted felons the right to vote in federal elections freezing Republicans out of power forever. A packing of the Supreme Court would begin by raising by six the number of justices and elevating liberal activists to the new seats.On the southern border where 100000 illegal migrants were apprehended in March Trump's wall would come down all peoples fleeing repression in Central America would be welcomed into the U.S. sanctuary cities would become the norm and ICE would be abolished.Open borders would be a reality along with amnesty for the 12 million-20 million people here illegally with a path to citizenship for all.It is impossible to see how the U.S. border would ever be secured.The Green New Deal would be enacted. Medicare for all. Free tuition for college students. Millennial college debts paid off by the government. Free pre-K schooling and day care. Guaranteed jobs for all. A guaranteed living wage. Repeal of the Reagan and Trump tax cuts. A re-raising of the corporate rate and a return of the top rate for individuals to 70 percent. New wealth taxes on the rich.With climate change seen as an existential planetary peril fossil fuel-powered energy plants -- coal oil natural gas -- would be phased out and a new national reliance on solar and wind begun.There would be reparations for slavery. Abortion on demand right up to birth for all women. Marijuana would be legalized. Harris has urged that prostitution sex work be legalized.How would the Green New Deal be paid for?Under ""modern monetary theory"" currency is a public monopoly for the government and unemployment is evidence that the monopoly is choking off the needed supply. So print the money necessary to get to rising wages full employment and a booming economy.To achieve Bernie Sanders' Socialist America the filibuster would have to be abolished easily done and the Constitution altered requiring the support of three-fourths of the states not so easy.Yet as of today the unannounced front-runner Joe Biden who is taking fire from many quarters appears to be the last man standing between Sanders Socialism and the Democratic nomination.Should Joe falter and fall Trump would be the nation's last line of defense against the coming of a Socialist America. For never-Trump conservatives the day of reckoning may be just ahead.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Bernie Sanders: Felons should be able to vote while in prison | Fox NewBernie Sanders: Felons should be able to vote while in prisoFlorida Rights Restoration Coalition works to restore ex-felon's voting rights amid Republican pushbacDesmond Meade and Neil Volz say that felons that have paid their debt to society should be allowed to vote.has long fought to restore voting rights for felons whoÛªve completed their prison sentences.Now the presidential candidate wants to go a big step further ÛÒ arguing that those currently behind bars should be able to vote too.FLORIDA MOVES TO REGISTER FORMER FELONS TO VOTAsked on the campaign trail in Muscatine Iowa on Saturday if those imprisoned should have the right to vote the independent senator from Vermont whoÛªs making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination answered: ""I think that is absolutely the direction we should go.Û""In my state what we do is separate.

I believe in that yes I do.ÛSANDERS UNLOADS ON TRUMP AT SHARPTON CONFERENCEVermont and Maine are the only states to allow felons currently serving their sentences to vote.The issue of voting rights for felonis in the spotlight in Iowa the state that votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar. The Hawkeye state and Kentucky are the only two in the nation to permanently disenfranchise everyone with felony convictions from voting.Iowa GOP Gov. Kim Reynolds is pushing for a constitutional amendment to allow convicts to have their voting rights restored after theyÛªve served their sentences. But last week the Republican-controlled state-Senate torpedoed the plan likely killing it for the year.Sanders took to Twitter at the time to write ÛÏthis is a disappointing setback for voting rights in Iowa.ÛVoting rights in 36 states and the District of Columbia are restored to felons after theyÛªve completed the sentences with the laws varying to factor in parole and probation.Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was asked about the issue a week ago as the Massachusetts Democrat was campaigning in Iowa. She called for felons whoÛªve served their time to have the right to vote. But she stopped short of advocating that those actually in prison be able to vote.""While theyÛªre incarceratedåÊI think thatÛªs something we can have more conversation about"" she said.FLORIDA PASSES RESTORING VOTING RIGHTS FOR FELONLast November voters in Florida approved a constitutional amendment restoring the right to vote for the 1.4 million felons whoÛªve finished serving their sentences. Florida was the most populous of 10 states that permanently disenfranchised some people with criminal convictions.Last April Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York signed an executive order restoring voting rights for felons on parole. And in 2016 VirginiaÛªs governor at the time Democrat Terry McAuliffe took executive action to restore voting rights to former felons.Opponents of allowing those in prison to vote argue that if youÛªre not willing to follow the law then you should not have a role in making law for everyone either directly by voting on referendums and ballot initiatives or indirectly by electing lawmakers.They point out that that the whole point of incarceration is to separate felons from society.The Republican National Committee said Democratic attempts to expand the pool of voters friendly to their party is behind the push to allow felons serving time to vote.ÛÏFrom suggesting that illegal immigrants should be able to vote to trying to lower the voting age to 16 to now proposing convicted felons behind bars should be able to vote Democrats are once again trying to rewrite the rules for their own political agenda.

"Will Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left? | RealClearPoliticWill Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left?Will Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left?Will Black Voters Keep Democrats From Going Too Far to the Left?Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Which of the two dozen or so Democratic presidential candidates is going to carry black voters next year? The answer to that question is likely to be identical to the answer to the question ""Which candidate is going to be the Democratic nominee and maybe the president?""For years black Americans have cast about 1 out of 4 votes in Democratic primaries. In 2016 they cast 71% of Democratic primary votes in Mississippi 61% in South Carolina 54% in Alabama 51% in Georgia 46% in Maryland 32% in North Carolina and Tennessee and 20 to 28% in Arkansas Florida Illinois Virginia New York Michigan Missouri and Ohio.Near-unanimous black support helped nominate and elect the last three Democratic presidents -- Jimmy Carter Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. It's near-unanimous because black voters have tended to vote solidly for one candidate over another in the primaries even against alternatives with serious claims on their support.Such solidarity in voting makes sense for people identifying as part of a distinct group suffering discrimination. For years political reporters have listened as black preachers avoiding outright endorsements called for ""unity."" Their congregations understood what they meant.Blacks have voted 85% or more Democratic in every presidential election since 1964; as well as in primaries for Jimmy Carter over Ted Kennedy in 1980; for Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988; for Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008; and for Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016.If the impulse toward solidarity prevails again in 2020 it's not clear who will benefit. Joe Biden after eight years as the faithful vice president to the nation's first black president leads among black voters in current polls. But will he run?The two candidates with African ancestry Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have background atypical of descendants of antebellum American slaves. Harris' father is from Jamaica and Booker grew up in an affluent black suburb in New Jersey. But then Barack Obama's background was even more atypical: How many Americans grew up in Indonesia?Plus there are signs that black voters may not be behaving as monolithically as they used to. Exit polls in the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries showed them favoring Clinton pretty unanimously in the South giving Sanders only 6 to 19% in former Confederate states. But in New York Pennsylvania five Great Lakes states and Missouri Sanders got between 26 and 32%; he carried three of them and came within 2 points of carrying two more.Chicago's mayoral election is another example of waning black solidarity. Although Tuesday's runoff was a contest between two black women neither had carried the city's 19 predominantly black wards in the nine-candidate Feb. 26 initial primary. Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot's electoral base was whites in upscale Lakefront wards and her appeal was not connected to race but a lack of entanglement with corruption-tinged insiders.Interestingly even on race-related issues white college graduates not blacks are now the most liberal segment of the Democratic electorate. As New York Times blogger Thomas Edsall notes more white liberals (79%) than blacks (60%) believe that racial discrimination is the main reason many blacks can't get ahead. Fully 32% of blacks say blacks who don't are mostly responsible for that.Black voters are generally more religious than whites and much more than white liberals; they cast the deciding votes against same-sex marriage in California in 2008 and opposed it in North Carolina in 2012 changing their minds only after then-President Barack Obama endorsed it a day later. Indeed blacks make up a large share of the diminishing number of Democratic primary voters labeling themselves as moderate or conservative.Black Democrats seem less likely than white college-graduate liberals to support and to identify as litmus tests positions unpopular with most general election voters like open-border immigration ninth-month abortions and the Green New Deal. Perhaps they will prevent ""woke"" white college graduates -- and a press almost entirely made up of this demographic -- from pulling the Party too far to the left to defeat a Republican incumbent whose job approval seems stuck around 45%.Or perhaps not. The Democratic Party from its Jacksonian foundation in 1832 has always been a coalition of out-groups of people not considered typical Americans. At their best they're a triumphant majority. At their worst they're a disorderly rabble. Which will they be in 2020? Black voters will have a big say in that.Michael Barone is senior political analyst foråÊ the Washington Examiner resident fellow at American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.Signup to receive email alertLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Stop Comparing Political Rivals to Nazis | RealClearPoliticStop Comparing Political Rivals to NaziStop Comparing Political Rivals to NaziStop Comparing Political Rivals to NaziKelsey Kremer/The Des Moines Register via AKelsey Kremer/The Des Moines Register via AVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In fits of hyperbolic condemnation for President Trump and the America First movement political and media leftists continue to escalate their rhetoric and now reach almost casually for comparisons to Hitler and his evil Nazi regime.åÊ Such obscene references poison our public dialogue demean the horror suffered by Holocaust victims and betray the heroism of our American military veterans.On Thursday former Congressman Beto OÛªRourke appeared at a campaign event in Carroll Iowa and castigated President TrumpÛªs tough talk on illegal border crossings as reminiscent of the ÛÏThird Reich.ÛåÊ OÛªRourke told the story of a visit to an elementary school where a ÛÏthird grade girl who was handing us the hand-drawn Valentines who happens to be Mexican American says: Û÷Why does the president not like me?ÛªÛ Quite frankly I find OÛªRourkeÛªs setup difficult to accept as it conveniently fits the popular but dubiousof the ÛÏwoke 8 year old.Û Even more suspiciously it almost precisely replicates the story PlayboyÛªs White House correspondent Brian Karem: that a ÛÏyoung Hispanic boyÛ on the Washington subway ÛÏsaw my press pass and asked me Û÷why does the president hate me?ÛªÛBut regardless of the veracity of these accounts OÛªRourke leapt at the opportunity to compare Trump to Nazis.åÊ Hethe audience that the president ÛÏwent on to call asylum seekers animals. Û_ Now we would not be surprised if in the Third Reich other human beings were described as an infestation as a cockroach or a pest you would want to kill.ÛFirst President Trump did not at all call asylum seekers ÛÏanimalsÛ but rather verydirected that descriptor toward violent MS-13 gang assailants. Trump opponents have lied about these ÛÏanimalÛ comments almost as often as they have propagated the totallyCharlottesville hoax the myth that he called neo-Nazi supremacists ÛÏfine people.ÛThe extremist OÛªRourke clearly disagrees vehemently with Trump on U.S. border sovereignty even arguing to tear down alreadybarricades. While his open-borders fantasies represent awful policy he at least displays honesty in publicly staking out his highly unpopular view.åÊ But he also delves into demonization comparing Trump and border enforcement to the most evil regime of modern history one that systemically slaughtered millions of people.Sadly OÛªRourke finds much company in this ugly pattern of Nazi analogizing among Trump critics.åÊ For example former CIA Director Michael Hayden tweeted out a picture of the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp with theÛÏother governments have separated mothers and children.ÛåÊ MSNBCÛªs Donny Deutsch expanded the condemnation not only impugning Trump and our Homeland Security agents but also the 63 million Americans who voted for the president.åÊ DeutschÛÏMorning JoeÛ viewers that ÛÏif you vote for Trump then you the voter -- you not Trump -- are standing at the border like Nazis.ÛIt is really beneath decency to debate these accusations on their substance though I will point out that Trump ironically is the closest America has ever come to a Jewish president.åÊ No national political leader in our country deserves such ignorant insults and certainly not a man who shares Shabbat with his own grandchildren and wasby Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that ÛÏIsrael has never had a better friend than you.ÛEven more importantly cavalier comparisons like OÛªRourkeÛªs denigrate the ghastly sufferings of the millions massacred by Hitler and his henchmen.åÊ Throwing around Nazi references to disparage rivals over policy prescriptions cheapens the sacredness of the true horrors of the Shoah.åÊ Edna Friedberg a historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museumthat politicians and media figures ÛÏcasually use Holocaust terminology to bash anyone or any policy with which they disagree.ÛMoreover such vile analogies disrespect the honor of AmericaÛªs veterans who led the alliance that toppled the wicked Nazi menace.åÊ Hundreds of thousands of young Americans perished across an ocean to dismantle fascism.åÊ American military cemeteries dot that continent today and remind us of the price our country paid to smash oppression.åÊ ThereÛªs truth in the aphorism that ÛÏpolitics ainÛªt bean-bagÛ and we should all welcome a vigorous debate on controversial ideas such as illegal immigration.åÊ But we should also all agree to refrain from comparing political rivals to the worst murderous monsters in history.Steve Cortes is a contributor to RealClearPolitics and a CNNåÊ political commentator.

"With Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive Unity | RealClearPoliticWith Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive UnitWith Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive UnitWith Mueller Hopes Gone So Goes Progressive UnitVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...The Democratic Party has lots of radical new ideas and lots of radical presidential candidates and politicos.But the common hatred of President Donald Trump has united otherwise quite disparate Democratic leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.); former Vice President Joe Biden; Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif) Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); and Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.).These diverse progressive politicians all shared faith in special counsel Robert Mueller and his ""dream team."" They believed over the last two years that the Mueller investigation was slowly grinding down Trump. T-shirts were sold with the slogan ""God Protect Robert Mueller.""The unifying progressive creed assumed that the Mueller's team would eventually find Trump unequivocally guilty of ""collusion"" with Russia. That buzzword was the non-criminal euphemism for felonious conspiracy to rig an election.The hunt for collusion would end with the holy grail of Trump's impeachment and removal from office. In 2020 there would be an almost automatic progressive takeover of government.Periodic leaks from Mueller's team during the investigation's 22 months prompted giddy media anticipation that ""the walls were closing in on"" Trump. It always seemed that the ""noose was tightening"" around him and that yet another ""bombshell"" was about to go off.This anti-Trump echo chamber lessened the need for progressives to offer a comprehensive coherent and winning alternate agenda. Damning the sure-to-be-impeached Trump was unity enough. All progressives at least agreed on that.But as Mueller was supposedly about to indict Trump a divisive hard-left agenda was almost imperceptibly floated to the public: the Green New Deal reparations for slavery abortion redefined as permissible infanticide open borders packing the Supreme Court with liberal justices the abolition of the Electoral College and ICE free college tuition the elimination of student debt Medicare for all a wealth tax a 70 percent top marginal income tax rate a 16-year-old voting age voting rights for ex-felons and on and on.It seemed as if today's radical proposal would become yesterday's sellout within 24 hours as progressives awaited tomorrow's even more revolutionary idea.While progressives were celebrating the seemingly inevitable Mueller indictment of Trump they were also increasingly at odds over many of these divisive and mostly unpopular new issues and over the self-created paradoxes of identity politics.When he was not declaring Trump guilty of treason Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke a lifelong beneficiary of wealth and influence did his best to blast his own past white privilege.Socialist presidential candidate Bernie Sanders when he was not predicating Trump's impeachment talked in the abstract as if an old white guy like himself in the concrete had no business running for president.Current front-runner Joe Biden when he was not gloating over Trump's supposed guilt tried hard to trash his own white male culture as the root of many of America's problems.How odd that three of the anti-white-male party's leading presidential contenders were none other than the white male trio of Biden Bernie and Beto.Now Mueller has gone his report having found no evidence of an election conspiracy. There is no longer a rallying cry of Trump-Russia collusion.In other words an investigation that for two years had reconciled the irreconcilable serves no longer as a source of Democratic unity.We are going to see hard-left Democrats and socialists force their mostly unpopular agenda on politicians and candidates from their own party. And they are now putting their identity-politics money where their mouth is by openly discouraging candidates on the basis of their race and gender.With the end of the Mueller investigation thousands of government documents mostly unredacted will be released. The result may be that the hunters of Trump soon become hunted by federal prosecutors. Sworn statements of Obama administration officials in the Justice Department CIA FBI and other bureaucracies will contradict newly released documents.To escape punishment all of these players in the Russian collusion delusion may now begin to turn on one another after being so united in going after Donald Trump.The media sensationalism and optics will play out in reverse as the ""noose tightens"" and ""the walls close in"" on people such as former CIA Director John Brennan former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.There will also be more infighting over the collective embarrassment of the Russian collusion hoax.A few shamed progressive politicians and reporters will grow quiet and acknowledge their overreach. But many will double down and weirdly insist that there really was Russian collusion and that the Steele dossier was true. Most will remain unashamed and simply move on to the next supposed Trump scandal.Progressives in unison boarded the Mueller express to nowhere. As they now jump off the train wreck the fighting won't be pretty.(C) 2019 TRIBUNE CONTENT AGENCY LLC.Victor Davis Hanson is a classicist and historian at the Hoover Institution Stanford University.

Richard Neal who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee is the first such demand for a sitting presidentÛªs tax information in 45 years.(Photo: J. Scott Applewhite / AP)ÛÒ A House committee chairman on Wednesday formally asked the IRS to provide six years of President Donald TrumpÛªs personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses as Democrats try to shed light on his complex financial dealings and potential conflicts of interest.The request by Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal who heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee is the first such demand for a sitting presidentÛªs tax information in 45 years. The move is likely to set off a huge legal battle between Democrats controlling the House and the Trump administration.Neal made the request in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig asking for TrumpÛªs personal and business returns for 2013 through 2018. He asked for the documents in seven days setting an April 10 deadline.Trump told reporters Wednesday he ÛÏwould not be inclinedÛ to provide his tax returns to the committee.Three of the eight Trump businesses in NealÛªs request are also among the 14 Trump legal entities that were subpoenaed by the attorneys general of Maryland and Washington D.C. in a lawsuit now in a federal appeals court. That suit alleges that Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at his Washington hotel.The Trump businesses in the new request ÛÓ part of TrumpÛªs global empire of some 500 entities ÛÓ include the trust he set up to handle all his holdings during his presidency making it the most important of the group.Also included is TrumpÛªs golf club in Bedminster New Jersey.An IRS spokesman said the agency had no immediate comment on NealÛªs request.Democrats insist that obtaining TrumpÛªs tax filings falls within their mandate of congressional oversight. Republicans have denounced it as a political witch hunt and invoked privacy concerns.ÛÏWe have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this magnitude and I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative legal and oversight rightsÛ Neal said in a statement Wednesday evening.Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas the senior Republican on the Ways and Means panel denounced the move as ÛÏan abuse of the tax-writing committeesÛª statutory authority.ÛÛÏWeaponizing our nationÛªs tax code by targeting political foes sets a dangerous precedent and weakens AmericansÛª privacy rightsÛ Brady wrote in a letter Wednesday to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who oversees the IRS. ÛÏAs you know by law all Americans have a fundamental right to the privacy of the personal information found in their tax returns.ÛThe legal battle set to ensue could take years to resolve possibly stretching beyond the 2020 presidential election.Trump broke with decades of tradition for presidential candidates by refusing to release his income tax filings during his 2016 campaign. He has said he wonÛªt release them because he is being audited even though IRS officials have said taxpayers under audit are free to release their returns. Trump claimed at a news conference following the November election that the filings are too complex for people to understand.The IRS has a policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents ÛÏyet little is known about the effectiveness of this programÛ Neal said in the statement. ÛÏOn behalf of the American people the Ways and Means Committee must determine if that policy is being followed and if so whether these audits are conducted fully and appropriately.ÛNeal continued ÛÏIn order to fairly make that determination we must obtain President TrumpÛªs tax returns and review whether the IRS is carrying out its responsibilities.ÛNeal is one of only three congressional officials authorized to make a written request to the Treasury secretary for anyoneÛªs tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service is part of the Treasury Department. A rarely used 1924 law says the Treasury chief ÛÏshall furnishÛ the requested material to members of the Ways and Means Committee for them to examine behind closed doors.A spokesman for Mnuchin didnÛªt immediately respond to requests for comment.Mnuchin suggested in testimony to Congress last month that he would protect TrumpÛªs privacy if the House Democrats requested his tax returns. ÛÏWe will examine the request and we will follow the law Û_ and we will protect the president as we would protect any taxpayerÛ regarding their right to privacy Mnuchin said.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2019/04/04/congress-trump-taxes/39296907/,0

What He Just Did To Tomi Lahren RUINED HIMSELF!Image Source: The View Gage SkidmorGlen Beck has been very adamantly against President Trump since the beginning and this has reflected in poor ratings for his radio show The Blaze.The only saving grace for his ratings and his company was the blonde bombshell Tomi Lahren who isnÛªt afraid to speak her mind and speak the truth even if it offends anti-Trump people like Glenn Beck and the Democrats.It appears that Glenn Beck has finally lost his mind completely because he just suspended Tomi Lahren and her show following her appearance on The View.Glenn Beck has just been looking for a convenient excuse to get rid of Tomi Lahren because she is way more popular than him and he canÛªt stand it.Beck apparently didnÛªt think this through very much though because now that he has suspended the only person bringing people to his channel he is going to tank in the ratings even more.Conservative media company The Blaze has suspended political commentator Tomi Lahren multiple sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Daily Caller.LahrenÌ¢åÛåªs inflammatory style placed her at odds with other employees at The Blaze as previously reported by TheDC.

Friday April 5 2019. Trump headed to the border with Mexico to make a renewed push for border security as a central campaign issue for his 2020 re-election.(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP)ÛÒ Giving himself credit for tough diplomacy President Donald Trump is describing a burst of activity by Mexican authorities to keep Central American migrants from getting to the U.S. border.ThatÛªs an apparent mirage as Trump retreats from his latest threat to seal off the U.S. from Mexico.Trump was wrong when he said last week that Mexico was doing ÛÏNOTHINGÛ about migrants coming north. It markedly tightened migration controls during the Obama administration and detained over 30000 foreigners in the first three months of this year.And itÛªs not evident now that Mexico has suddenly cracked down as a result of his threat ÛÏapprehending everybodyÛ and making ÛÏabsolutely terrific progressÛ in just a matter of days as Trump put it. MexicoÛªs apprehensions of foreigners have not surged.TRUMP on why he is pulling back on sealing the border imminently: ÛÏBecause Mexico has been absolutely terrific for the last four days. TheyÛªre apprehending everybody. Yesterday they apprehended 1400 people. The day before was 1000. And if they apprehend people at their southern border where they donÛªt have to walk through thatÛªs a big home run. We can handle it from there. ItÛªs really good. Û_ Mexico for the last four days itÛªs never happened like that in 35 years.Û ÛÒremarks to reporters Friday.TRUMP: ÛÏMexico has brought people back theyÛªve told people you canÛªt come in. And thatÛªs happened really theyÛªve done as I understand it over 1000 today over 1000 people yesterday over 1000 people the day before that. Before that they never did anything.Û ÛÒ remarks to reporters Thursday.THE FACTS: This depiction of Mexico going from strikeout to home run is inaccurate at both ends.Mexico reports that its interception and detention of migrants from the south are ÛÏabout averageÛ in recent months. Over the first three days of April it apprehended 1259 foreigners ÛÒ not 1000 or more a day as Trump claimed.ÛÏThere is no very substantive changeÛ MexicoÛªs foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said this week. ÛÏThere has not been a drastic change.ÛÛÏI donÛªt know what (Trump) was referring toÛ he added.Mexico is requiring migrants to register with authorities but thatÛªs been the case since Lopez Obrador took office Dec. 1 Ebrard said. ÛÏWhat Mexico is doing as far as the review of the southern border ÛÒ well itÛªs the same thing it has been doing since this government began.Û On Thursday MexicoÛªs ambassador to the U.S. Martha Barcena told The Associated Press her country is working to make its own border ÛÏmore orderlyÛ but ÛÏmigration will never be stopped.ÛMexico took a substantial step in 2014 implementing a ÛÏSouthern Border PlanÛ that established checkpoints and raids to discourage migrants from riding trains or buses from Guatemala. Its detention of foreigners almost all Central Americans surged to 198141 over the next year from 127149. Last year it detained 138612.The White House has refused to substantiate TrumpÛªs claim about MexicoÛªs migrant apprehensions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday credited Mexico with the ÛÏwillÛ to help stem migration but he did not cite results. Even as Trump claimed a Mexican crackdown Pompeo said the U.S. needs to see action from Mexico telling Fox News that itÛªs ÛÏone thing to talk about it.ÛTrump has abandoned his vow to shut the border imminently. He now says that if Mexico does not continue cooperating on migrants he will try to put heavy duties on autos from Mexico and revive his border-closure threat if that doesnÛªt work.Stevenson reported from Mexico City.

Stop breaking the damn law.Snowden is exactly right. If our government didnÛªt have so much to hide and wasnÛªt so scared about whistleblowers like Snowden and WikiLeaks then this wouldnÛªt be a problem at all.James Comey is also the head of the FBI that has seen numerous intelligence documents leaked to the press in an attempt to damage President TrumpÛªs reputation.Comey is playing politics and that means he canÛªt be trusted.Share this everywhere to show that if Comey didnÛªt have something to hide the leaks wouldnÛªt worry him so much!Alex only wants freedom to reign so he tries to achieve that the best way he knows how by sharing news.Trey Gowdy Reminds Comey that Obama Face up to 10 Years in Prison!James Comey Testifies On False Claims On President Trump Connections With RussiFBI Launches Massive Investigation into Hillary!' + arr_splits[i] + '"" + formated_str + """,0

No previous administration had tested that policy under President Trump who suggested it in one of his first executive orders in 2017.His administration began to implement it earlier this year hoping that making migrants wait outside the U.S. ÛÓ thereby denying them the chance to gain a foothold here ÛÓ would discourage some of the Central Americans rushing the border right now from coming.The program has gotten a slow start.

In December of that year Schiff said on CNN: ""The Russians offered help the campaign accepted help. The Russians gave help and the president made full use of that help. That is pretty damning whether it is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conspiracy or not.""And in May of last year Schiff said on ABC that the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee emails is ""like Watergate in the sense that you had a break in at the Democratic headquarters in this case a virtual one not a physical break in and you had a president as part of a cover up."" Schiff said later that the Russia investigation is ""a size and scope probably beyond Watergate.""Despite SchiffÛªs claims Mueller found no evidence of coordination or conspiracy involving Trump his campaign and the Russian government Attorney General William Barr wrote in a letter released late last month.Now TrumpÛªs Republican allies ÛÒ from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ÛÒ are calling on Schiff to do everything from vacating his committee chairmanship to leavingåÊoffice.MUELLER NOT RECOMMENDING FURTHER INDICTMENTS AFTER REPORT TURNOVEÛÏHe owes an apology to the American public"" McCarthy said.åÊÛÏThere is no place in Adam Schiff&amp;apos;s world or in Congress that he should be chair of the intel committee.""McCarthy added: ""There is no way he could lead the intel committee and he should step back.""Schiff remains steadfast in his claims that there is evidence of wrongdoing ÛÏin plain sight.ÛCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APÛÏI don&amp;apos;t regret calling out this president for what i consider deeply unethical and improper conduct and the moment we start to think that we should back away from exposing this kind of malfeasance and corruption is a dangerous pointÛ he said.Schiff added: ÛÏThere is a risk when you have an immoral president a president who lacks in basic character who violates the norms of office.

And Nessel's office said she will ""refrain from opining"" on the laws until the Supreme Court review is complete.The controversial minimum wage and paid sick leave laws changed in December and signed by then-Gov. Rick SnyderåÊtook effect last week despite the ongoing legal reviews.Republicans have maintained their actions were in line with the state Constitution when rather than allowing the minimum wage and paid sick leave petitions to be placed on the ballot they adopted the proposals and amended them so as not to overly burden Michigan businesses.But Democrats have argued it is unconstitutional to adopt initiated legislation only to ÛÏgutÛ it in the same two-year session.Organizers had collected hundreds of thousands of petition signatures to send the proposals to the Legislature which has constitutional authority to adopt initiatives within 40 days or allow them to go to the ballot.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a Democrat who took office Jan. 1 had notåÊ heard about the Supreme Court development by mid-day Wednesday but said ÛÏlame-duck sessions move fast and furious and mistakes get made.ÛSenate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey a Clarklake Republican who sponsored changes to the paid sick leave law and pushed for a Supreme Court review is ""eager to have the process move forward"" said spokeswoman Amber McCann.""He wishes the uncertainty would be removed sooner but he is confident in the eventual outcome and will remain patient.""Brian Calley president of the Small Business Association of Michigan who was lieutenant governor last year echoed the sentiments saying the Supreme Court ""has theåÊåÊopportunity to improve the jobs climate by removing any uncertainty"" about the status of the laws.Nessel spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said the attorney general won't issue her own legal opinion on the laws ""unless or until the matter remains unsolved following the outcome"" of the Supreme Court review which she said is consistent with past precedent.But the Supreme Court has asked the Attorney General's office to submit legal briefs arguing ""both sides"" of the case"" Rossman-McKinney said calling it an ""unusual"" but ""not unprecedented"" request.""Twice in the last 10 years the Michigan Supreme Court has ordered the Department of Attorney General to brief both sides of an issue: in 2016 on the funding of private schools and in 2011 on taxing pensions"" she noted.Danielle Atkinson co-chair of the MI Time To Care committee that collected signatures for the paid sick leave initiative saidåÊlawmakers ÛÏfailed to followÛ the Constitution when they amended the law and she hopes the Michigan Supreme Court will agree.ÛÏWe believe the scheme was a clear violation of MichiganÛªs ConstitutionÛ she saidåÊ in a statement noting lawmakers have the option to send initiatives to the ballot approve them or also put an alternative before voters.ÛÏThe Legislature chose to create an unconstitutional fourth option by passing the law in September with the intention of gutting it in December before it ever took effectÛ Atkinson said.Under the amended lawsåÊMichiganÛªs minimum wage is set to increase from $9.25 to $12.05 per hour by 2030 slowing the initial proposedåÊincrease to $12 by 2022. The minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers will rise to $4.58 by 2030 instead of $12 by 2024.Lawmakers also exempted companies with fewer than 50 employees from the paid sick leave law ensuring it does not apply toåÊmore than 160000 small businesses that collectively employ more than 1 million workers across the state.The Michigan Supreme Court is asking the Michigan House and Senate along with any member of either chamber to file legal briefs as it considers whether to issue an advisory opinion on the legality of the legislative maneuver.Other peopleåÊor groups can seek permission to file their own arguments in the matter. Briefs arguing for the constitutionality of the amended laws are due by May 15 while opposition briefs are due by June 19.While Nessel has been asked for her own legal opinion past attorneys general have offered conflicting opinions on the legality of the move.In a 1964 opinion then-Attorney General Frank Kelly a Democrat held that adopting an initiative sent to the Legislature through a petition drive only toåÊchange it in the same session would violate ÛÏthe spirit and letterÛ of the process allowed under the 1963 Constitution.But former Attorney General Bill Schuette a Republican upended that opinion last year and gave his legal blessing to the adopt-and-amend strategy.Voters who approved the Michigan Constitution ""did not impose any express limitations on amending a legislatively enacted initiated lawÛ Schuette wrote in an opinion issued a day before Republicans proceeded to change both laws.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/03/michigan-supreme-court-arguments-gop-minimum-wage-sick-leave/3353306002/",0

Trump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on Border | RealClearPoliticTrump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on BordeTrump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on BordeTrump's Choice at Homeland Security Focuses on BordeVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON (AP) ÛÓ Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned amid President Donald TrumpÛªs growing frustration and bitterness over the number of Central American families crossing the southern border.Trump announced on Sunday in a tweet that U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department. McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well-respected by members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects TrumpÛªs priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.ÛÏI have determined that it is the right time for me to step asideÛ Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. ÛÏI hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure AmericaÛªs borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationÛªs discourse.ÛThough Trump aides were eyeing aåÊstaff shake-upåÊat Homeland Security and had alreadyåÊwithdrawn the nominationåÊfor another key immigration post the development Sunday was unexpected.Nielsen traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed TrumpÛªs comments on the situation at the border though she ducked out of the room without explanation for some time while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers Nielsen was at TrumpÛªs side introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward on a Coast Guard Gulfstream as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.Nielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether sheÛªd be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning though she was not forced to do so they said.Nielsen is the latest person felled in the Trump administrationÛªs unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials brought about by the presidentÛªs mercurial management style insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.Nielsen was also the highest profile female Cabinet member and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and the White House staff itself without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary Jim Mattis was pushed out in December over criticism of the presidentÛªs Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January following John KellyÛªs resignation last year.HeråÊresignation lettåÊer lacked any sense of controversy ÛÓ unlike those of others who have left. She thanked Trump and DHS staff for their hard work.Her replacement McAleenan has helped shape many of the administrationÛªs policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders the White House and Homeland Security officials. But itÛªs unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary after her predecessor Kelly became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.Once Kelly left the White House NielsenÛªs days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November but her exit never materialized. During the government shutdown over TrumpÛªs insistence for funding for a border wall NielsenÛªs standing inside the White House even appeared to rise.But in recent weeks as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign tensions flared anew.The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello ÛÓ a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller an immigration hardliner and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views the people said.Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday but when there was no time she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March over half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers ÛÓ scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday ÛÓ was postponed.Nielsen dutifully pushed TrumpÛªs immigration policies including funding for his border wall and defended the administrationÛªs practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens ÛÏin the United States every day.Û But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.Under Nielsen migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3000 families and facilities are at capacity.She also advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and often said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online ÛÓ not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2018 election.She led the federal agency since December 2017 and was this administrationÛªs third Homeland Security secretary. A protege of KellyÛªs he brought her to the White House after Trump named him chief of staff. She earned a reputation as an enforcer working to corral the chaotic West Wing.Nielsen 45 previously served as a special assistant to President George W. Bush and worked for the Transportation Security Administration.She rose through the Trump ranks quickly ÛÓ joining the transition team after the election to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process. She quickly became a trusted aide to Kelly and the two worked together to impose order on a dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said her tenure was ÛÏa disaster from the start.Û The policies she helped create ÛÏhave been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.ÛHis Senate counterpart Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis. said the government needed ÛÏsteady informed and effective leadership in the administration and in Congress to have any hope of fixing our out-of-control border security and immigration problems.ÛLog In with your RCMG Accoun,0
As NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed Bonds | RealClearPoliticAs NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed BondAs NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed BondAs NATO Turns 70 Survey Shows Frayed BondVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...April 4 is the 7anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which began with the signing of the so-called Washington Treaty by 12 founding nation-states mostly Western European nations along with the United States.åÊ The pact was an expansion of the Brussels Treaty that preceded it drawing the U.S. into the alliance as a necessary guarantor of security for Western Europe. The mission was to form a stronger coalition to prevent a repeat of the circumstances that led predominantly in Germany to the two world wars and also deter the expansionist aspirations of the newly formed communist Soviet Union.Seven decades on NATO has grown to include 29 nations. But its strength and the commitment of its members to mutual security is very much in question as acommissioned by CKI and RealClearPolitics to mark the anniversary makes evident.To be fair the United StatesÛª own entry into the alliance was not without reservation a reluctance with deep historical roots.åÊ (In his farewell address George Washington spoke of his concerns about alliances dragging nations into someone elseÛªs wars.) Secretary of State George Marshall had expressed concerns to British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin: ÛÏShow what youÛªre prepared to do for yourselves and each other and then weÛªll think about what we might do.ÛHowever after deliberations and careful wording of the treaty wariness about Soviet militarization and expansion compelled the U.S. to join NATO in what would become the Cold War strategy of containment.In response the Soviet Union created the Warsaw Pact ÛÒ formally known as the Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Mutual Assistance -- comprised of Soviet satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe. Decades later some experts in the field of international relations see modern parallels between Western nationsÛª security expansion and a Russian response. University of Chicago Professor John J. Mearsheimer commenting in 2014 on RussiaÛªs invasion of Ukrainethat ÛÏthe United States and its European allies share most of the responsibility for the crisis. The taproot of the trouble is NATO enlargement the central element of a larger strategy to move Ukraine out of RussiaÛªs orbit and integrate it into the West.ÛThough this sentiment was not widely held both President Obama and now President Trump voiced concern over the transatlantic alliance ÛÒ primarily in ways that echoedåÊ MarshallÛªs.ObamaÛªs relationship with NATO declined as his frustrations grew over European alliesÛª lack of response to the turmoil in Libya prompting him to refer to them as ÛÏ.Û Although the 2 percent of GDP spending for NATO is only a guideline not a requirement for member states EuropeÛªs contribution has fallen. Obama's critique of Europe's response to the Libya situation exposed a perhaps more significant shortcoming among NATO nations than just spending: a lack of resolve.TrumpÛªs harsh rhetoric has taken the NATO debate to an entirely new level. Throughout much of 2018 he went so far as to threatenthe U.S. from the alliance.The recent CKI/RCP poll conducted by YouGov provides insights into why both Obama and Trump have called the European commitment ÛÒ especially that of Germans surveyed -- to the NATO alliance into question.The poll found that a majority of Germans are indifferent to the security provided by the organization. Most striking is that 48 percent of German respondents think they should not provide military support to a NATO member state if Russia attacks it with an additional 28 percent saying that they don't know if support would be warranted. (Curiously most Germans also think that their own nation falls short of providing their security.) A majority are also against providing military support to the United States if it were attacked a stark contrast to French and British respondents among whom only about a third are opposed.The reason for GermansÛª indifference may be reflected by another finding: Germany no longer perceives Russia to be the great threat it once was (to a lesser extent neither does the rest of Western Europe).A majority of Germans even go so far as to say they perceive the U.S. to be athreat to their security than Russia. Though many attribute this to TrumpÛªs threats toof NATO the CKI/RCP polling suggests that more is involved. When asked if Russia were to invade any NATO country only a quarter (in Germany and France) to a third (in the U.S. and U.K.) think their countries should provide a military response to defend that country.åÊ On the flip side about a third (in the U.S. U.K. and France) and nearly half (as already cited 48 percent) of Germans think their country should not respond.åÊ Though not a majority these numbers represent a significant rebuke of the NATO charterÛªs Article V which stipulates mutual defense on both sides of the Atlantic.ObamaÛªs frustration and now TrumpÛªs openly critical brand of diplomacy highlight what is perhaps a consequence of the Cold War peace dividend -- the Western military rollback resulting from the reduced threat after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.åÊ Further stressed by the global financial crisis of 2008 the European NATO states have become introspective focused most on internal security and cautious in their spending.åÊ Notwithstanding RussiaÛªs intensive cyber and information operations Europeans largely no longer perceive it to be the great threat of generations past.History shows that they do so at their peril. With the 7anniversary of NATO at hand the disinterest in honoring the organizationÛªs guiding principle of mutual cooperation and security should be seen as a clarion call to revisit the alliance -- before the next crisis occurs.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0
"Get ready for a dose of health care politicking - Daily PresGet ready for a dose of health care politickinVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam center shakes the hand of Del. Lee Ware R-Powhatan left as he leaves the House chambers after delivering his ""State of the Commonwealth"" (Steve Helber / AP)Wondering what youÛªll be hearing aselection campaigns heat up? HereÛªs one hint: health insurance.(as expected ÛÓ or possibly even anticipated byleaders) vetoed Republican legislatorsÛª high-profile push for health insurance law changes they argued would ease the burden on individuals struggling to paypolicy premiums without the tax subsidies provided to people earning less than 400 percent of the poverty line (that translates to $49960 for a single person and $103000 for a family of four).The measures would have allowed all Virginians to buy the less expensive catastrophic coverage plans now available only to people under 30 and would also have extended the length of time people could be covered under less costly short-term coverage.Northam argued the bills would have put Virginians at risk of not having enough insurance and would fragment the stateÛªs insurance market in a way leading to rapidly increasing premiums for all.Texas and 17 other states sued the United States over thebut now that a federal judge down there has ruled the entire act is invalid the Trump Administration has decided Texas and those other mostly southern and wheat-belt states (nine of which have declined to use Obamacare...ÛÏMany individuals enrolled in a catastrophic health plan may forego medical services because of costÛ Northam said in one of his veto statements.And in those addressing short term coverage he said: ÛÏShort-term limited-duration plans are allowed to discriminate against individuals with pre-existing conditions impose lifetime and annual caps and are not required to provide essential health benefits.ÛRepublicans saw things a different way.ÛÏGovernor Northam continues to prevent Virginians from even being allowed the option of choosing a health care plan that better meets their needs and their budgetsÛ declared Senate President pro tempore R-Bedford who serves as chairman of the Senate Education and Health Committee.None of the bill passed the House of Delegates with veto-proof margins winning on pretty much party-line splits. Two drew bipartisan support in the state Senate. It takes a two-thirds vote in both House and Senate to override a governorÛªs veto.Meanwhile the Trump Administration moved unexpectedly to challenge the Affordable Care Act deciding to support Texas and 17 other states sued that the United States in their challenge to the law. Although Texas and the others sued the United States the Department of Justice has decided not to continue the battle in an appeals court.ÛÏThe Department of Justice has determined that the district courtÛªs judgment should be affirmedÛ assistant attorney general Joseph Hunt wrote in a brief two sentence note to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.He did not outline the administrationÛªs reasoning.But itÛªs no secret says Sen.ÛÏThe Trump Administration has long wanted to eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act which would take health care away from millions of people and threaten protections for those with pre-existing conditionsÛ Kaine said.The issue is the ACA requirement that all Americans have health insurance. When the federal tax reform of 2017 removed the tax penalties for failing to buy insurance Texas and the other states argued that the insurance mandate on its own was unconstitutional. A federal judge in Texas agreed and held that meant the entire act was invalid. meanwhile joined 21 other state attorneys general in support of the ACA and in opposition to the Texas-led groupÛªs lawsuit.ÛÏThis politically motivated lawsuit is dangerous reckless and risks the health of AmericansÛ Herring said.For Virginia overturning the Affordable Care Act would stop the Medicaid expansion which has already covered more than 200000 low income Virginians and is set to cover roughly 400000 in all Herring said. It would allow insurers to resume denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or allow insurers to charge those individuals more for coverage and put an end to the $1.15 billion in tax credits that helped 335000 Virginians afford insurance in 2017.Bipartisan efforts to end VirginiaÛªs practice of suspending driversÛª licenses when people miss payments of court fines and fees ran into a roadblock at House subcommittee during the 2019 General Assembly session ÛÓ but Gov. Ralph Northam may have found a way around.The governor wants to amend the state budget to remove the current requirement to suspend licenses for those unpaid court costs. His amendment would also restore licenses to some 627000 Virginians whose driving privileges are suspended because of unpaid fines.ÛÏThe practice of suspending a personÛªs driverÛªs license for nonpayment of court fines and costs is inequitableÛÓitÛªs past time we end itÛ Northam said. ÛÏA driverÛªs license is critical to daily life including a personÛªs ability to maintain a job. Eliminating a process that envelops hundreds of thousands of Virginians in a counterproductive cycle is not only fair itÛªs also the right thing to do.Ûhas some powerful gatekeepers ÛÓ as the tale of a reform meant to stop a revolving door at jails shows.The reform was simple enough: to end the requirement in state law to suspend a driverÛªs license if he or she doesnÛªt pay court fees and fines or make some immediate...Two bills to do that had sailed through the state Senate on votes of 36-4 and 38-2 but died in the House of DelegatesÛª criminal justice subcommittee a panel known for taking a tough line on proposals a majority of its member see as easing penalties for violating the law.The subcommitteeÛªs thumbs down kept the driverÛªs license measures from reaching the full House for a vote. But when the legislature reconvenes early next month a gubernatorial budget amendment goes directly to the full House first and then if it passes that body to the Senate. Gubernatorial amendments to the budget or to bills require a majority vote in both House and Senate.State Sen. Bill Stanley R-Franklin County who sponsored one of the bills that died in the House subcommittee has said his nose count at the time suggested the measure would have won 70 to 80 votes in the House.ÛÏThis will get it to the floorÛ Stanley said of his friend NorthamÛªs amendment.Stanley whose frustration with the roadblock in the House erupted publicly this year suggested to Northam that a budget amendment might be a way to let Republicans in the House have a chance to consider the issue.He thinks thereÛªs a shot ÛÓ at least as long as the idea isnÛªt seen as a partisan Democratic issue. And he has a reason for believing the idea of ending license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees will win support.StanleyÛªs been pushing to end those suspensions for three years. He has managed to convince most of his fellow GOP senators that suspending licenses for unpaid fees is in a sense an unfair punishment for not paying a tax as well as a huge hurdle for Virginians trying to make amends for past offenses as they get back on their feet. In a way he says ending the suspensions is about helping Virginians secure their independence and liberty.And while a budget amendment only lasts for the life of a budget ÛÓ a bit more than a year in this case ÛÓ Stanley believes NorthamÛªs idea if it doesnÛªt get hung up in the heated partisan politics of a legislative election year will set the stage for a more permanent fix.ÛÏWhen people see the sky didnÛªt fall and the sun kept rising with those license restorations I think it will change some mindsÛ he said.Jimmy Carter ss now the longest-living US President.

"White House cancels Major League Baseball's Cuba deal | Fox NewWhite House cancels Major League Baseball's Cuba deaTrump administration to tighten rules for baseball players from CubU.S. reportedly trying to make sure money paid to Cuban players doesn't go to Cuban government; FBN's Blake Burman has the details.The Trump administration is moving to end anagreement allowing Cuban baseball playerto sign contracts directly withclubs a change that requires Cuban players to once again cut ties with the Communist nation before signing a major league deal.Last year 25 Cuban-born players played in at least one major league baseball game.The Treasury Department&amp;apos;s Office of Foreign Assets Control told MLB attorneys in a letter Friday that it was reversing an Obama administration rule allowing the major leagues to pay the Cuban Baseball Federation a release fee equal to 25 percent of each Cuban player&amp;apos;s signing bonus. The payment mechanism was similar to agreements MLB has with leagues in China South Korea and Japan.In exchange the Cuban federation had agreed to release all players aged 25 and older with at least six years of professional experience.Rubio: I won't diplomatically recognize Cuba as presiden2016 GOP candidate says he would reverse 'one-sided deal' and strip embassy titlIn the letter which was made public Monday afternoon the Treasury Department told MLB that the payments to the Cuban Baseball Federation constituted illegal business with the Cuban government. That reverses a ruling made by the Obama administration allowing the payments.U.S. law prohibits virtually all payments to the Cuban government under the 60-year embargo on the island but MLB argued the Cuban Baseball Federation which oversees all aspects of the sport on the island was not formally a part of the Cuban state.Opponents called that argument ridiculous given the tight control the highly regimented government maintains over virtually every aspect of life in Cuba.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS AP""The U.S. does not support actions that would institutionalize a system by which a Cuban government entity garnishes the wages of hard-working athletes who simply seek to live and compete in a free society"" National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said in a statement. ""The Administration looks forward to working with MLB to identify ways for Cuban players to have the individual freedom to benefit from their talents and not as property of the Cuban State.""""We stand by the goal of the agreement which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba"" an MLB statement said.Without a formal path from Cuba to the major leagues hundreds of top players have left the island for good many making harrowing crossings on rafts and rickety boats in the years before Cuba abandoned a hated exit permit requirement for most of its citizens.White House targets Cuba Venezuela and NicaraguNational Security Adviser John Bolton brands the countries a 'troika of tyranny' while announcing new sanctions over human rights violations and political oppression.While such dangerous escapes were mostly eliminated with greater travel freedoms players still needed to cut ties with Cuban baseball and often their families and hometowns going years without returning after signing with the major leagues.""The deal with Major League Baseball is an attempt to stop human trafficking encourage cooperation and elevate the level of baseball"" the Cuban Baseball Federation said on Twitter. ""The politically motivated attacks on the deal hurt players their families and fans.""Last week the Cuban federation released a list of 34 players eligible to sign contracts with major league clubs. The players were aged between 17 and 25 years classified as international amateurs under MLB rules and eligible to sign minor league contracts. No likely stars were apparent on the list but more notable players included 22-year-old Raidel Martinez Perez and 23-year-old LivÌÁn Moinelo Pita who have played professionally in Japan; 17-year-old infielder Loidel ChapellÌ_ Zulueta; and 18-year-old pitcher Norge Carlos Vera Aldana.Fox News&amp;apos; John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignÛª with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed. å©2019 FOX News Network LLC.

However Trump was still the Republican candidate which makes it amazing that a speaker would backstab his nominee in such a way.Ryan can be heard on the audio sayinÌ¢åÛåÏI am not going to defend Donald Trump Ì¢åÛåÓ not now not in the futureÌ¢åÛå Ryan can be heard saying.This is not good for Ryan especially considering how much trumpÛªs supporters hate Ryan and the Republican establishment.These revelations give validity to the likes of Steven Bannon who has always warned Trump of the dangers that Paul Ryan presents.A spokesperson for Ryan told Breitbart that the audio is nothing new saying ÛÏThe world is well aware of this history. Û_ And obviously a lot has happened since then. As everyone knows.ÛA Full Transcript Of RyanÛªs Comments can be see below.Ì¢åÛåÏHis comments are not anywhere in keeping with our partyÌ¢åÛåªs principles and values There are basically two things that I want to make really clear as for myself as your Speaker. I am not going to defend Donald Trump Ì¢åÛåÓ not now not in the future. As you probably heard I disinvited him from my first congressional district GOP event this weekend Ì¢åÛåÓ a thing I do every year. And IÌ¢åÛåªm not going to be campaigning with him over the next 30 days Look you guys know I have real concerns with our nominee.ÌâåÊI hope you appreciate that IÌ¢åÛåªm doing what I think is best for you the members not whatÌ¢åÛåªs best for me. So I want to do whatÌ¢åÛåªs best for our members and I think this is the right thing to do. IÌ¢åÛåªm going to focus my time on campaigning for House Republicans. I talked to a bunch of you over the last 72 hours and here is basically my takeaway. To everyone on this call this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. Some of you are not But with respect to Donald Trump I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally you need to decide whatÌ¢åÛåªs best for you. And you all know whatÌ¢åÛåªs best for you where you are. But the last thing I want to do is to help Hillary Clinton get the presidency and get Congress. Look sheÌ¢åÛåªs a failed progressive. SheÌ¢åÛåªs running an abysmal campaign. I mean itÌ¢åÛåªs just Ì¢åÛåÓ itÌ¢åÛåªs amazing how easily she could be beaten She will take this country in the wrong direction. And the last thing we need is four more years of Obama policies or two years of a Clinton presidency with a Democrat Congress. Could you imagine what that would look like? So the last thing we want to be doing is giving Hillary Clinton a blank check in Congress. ThatÌ¢åÛåªs why IÌ¢åÛåªm going to spend the rest of this month fighting for Congress fighting for our majorities IÌ¢åÛåªm going to spend the next 28 days working hard with all of our members to get re-elected because we need a check on Hillary Clinton if Donald Trump and Mike Pence donÌ¢åÛåªt win the presidency Greg Walden will get more into what that looks like and what polling looks like but I want to basically close with this: His comments are indefensible theyÌ¢åÛåªre not in keeping with our principles so IÌ¢åÛåªm not going to try to defend him. IÌ¢åÛåªm going to focus on Congress IÌ¢åÛåªm going to focus on upholding our values.

"Despite It All Joe Biden Should Run | RealClearPoliticDespite It All Joe Biden Should RuDespite It All Joe Biden Should RuDespite It All Joe Biden Should RuVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- It will be good for the country and the Democratic Party for Joe Biden to run for president. But it could be hell on him.If Biden backed off from running he would be cast as a martyr to ""political correctness"" and ""the new multiculturalism"" by many of the same conservatives who would do everything they could to defeat him if he won the nomination. Faux sympathy of this sort is starting to appear on the right. It's designed precisely to undercut further advances toward gender and racial equality.Moreover as a noncandidate Biden would hang over the rest of the field like an absent giant who makes everyone else look small. The heart often longs for what it can't have. Instead of being ""too old to run"" Biden would become the missing and longed for ""elder statesman."" Cries of ""Where is Biden?"" would rise up whenever a major candidate stumbled. And God forbid if Trump were reelected we would again live through the ""If only Joe had run"" lamentations.All of this would be disastrous for Democrats and progressives. The only way to know for certain if Biden is in fact the best candidate to beat Trump is for him to get in the race -- to prove that he can appeal to young voters despite his age; to demonstrate that he can navigate a party that has changed dramatically since he first entered the Senate in 1973; and to show he can absorb all the blows that will come his way courtesy of opposition research into his astonishingly long career on the public stage.If he can pass these tests he will be more formidable for it. But to put it gently the experience will not be pleasant. And yes it's entirely fair to ask whether a 76-year-old can successfully navigate our changing mores and win over the younger voters Democrats need.As Paul Starr a professor at Princeton argued shrewdly last week in The American Prospect ""norms and beliefs about race gender and related issues have shifted dramatically among Democrats in recent decades."" As a result ""the very means by which Democrats won elections in the past are now seen as disqualifying by many in the party though not necessarily by the public at large.""Meaning for example that Biden's support for the 1994 crime bill which he could once wave proudly as a banner of toughness is now a liability. Most on the left (and many on the right) see overincarceration especially of African Americans as both a problem and an injustice.And behavior patterns once seen by many as signs of Biden's warm humanity are now condemned as ""handsiness"" or much worse. These complaints are not new but women are less willing than ever to stay silent about behavior most of them disliked in the first place. Last week Biden released a video pledging to be ""more mindful and respectful of people's personal space.""Affection for him is sufficiently widespread among Democrats that he seems to have weathered the latest challenge. But he didn't help himself by joking about the issue (twice) on Friday before a union crowd. And he will be further criticized about how he dealt with Anita Hill's accusations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and about his support for a regressive bankruptcy bill.These are real problems but they will be stacked against Biden's authentic contributions. In June 2008 I made a case for Biden as Barack Obama's running mate. I argued he was a ""happy warrior"" who would reinforce Obama's upbeat appeal. As a Catholic from a blue-collar world the son of Scranton Pennsylvania would strengthen Obama with constituencies where he needed help. Biden's background on foreign policy I said then would enhance Obama's ability to handle national security issues.Since opinion writers often get things very wrong I am grateful that subsequent events ratified my instincts: Biden was an asset in the campaign and throughout Obama's time in office. This still matters to a lot of Democrats.The bottom line is that Biden belongs in this fight. He represents important components of the coalition that will have to come together to defeat the president. He could help Democrats solve a strategic dilemma: How to be tough as nails on Trump while still promising the more harmonious political future that middle-of-the-road voters long for. And if he fails the ultimate nominee will be far better off for having faced down Biden and not be haunted by the ghost of a candidacy that never was.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

The move comes as his administration tries to deal with a 12-year high in U.S.-Mexico crossings straining the U.S. immigration system and leading Trump to threaten to close the border before backing off.The Associated Press reported earlier that a notice was sent to members of Congress on Thursday withdrawing Ron VitielloÛªs nomination to lead the agency. But the decision was unexpected and met with confusion.Vitiello was scheduled to travel with Trump to Calexico California on Friday and some of his aides thought he was still going to that border town even after the paperwork was sent. One Homeland Security official insisted it was nothing but a paperwork error that later was corrected.Trump said Friday before he left Washington that Vitiello was a ÛÏgood manÛ but ÛÏweÛªre going in a tougher direction.Û Trump did not explain what that meant and did not say who he had in mind as a replacement.The job requires Senate confirmation. Vitiello had cleared one committee and a second committee was consideration his nomination. Vitiello has been acting head since last June of the agency that enforces U.S. immigration law in the interior of the United States. He has more than 30 years in law enforcement starting in 1985 with the U.S. Border Patrol. He was previously Border Patrol chief and deputy commissioner U.S. Customs and Border Protection which oversees the patrol.Vitiello took over during a time of heightened scrutiny of the agency. Part of its mission is to arrest immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and that has made the agency a symbol of TrumpÛªs hard-line policies.Trump has railed anew recently against increasing border crossings as well as the release of thousands of migrants into the U.S. because of a lack of space to hold them a move he derides as ÛÏcatch and release.ÛItÛªs a battle cry on a signature issue for the president who wants to restrict immigration but whose policies have largely failed to do so.For many years families arriving at the border were typically released from U.S. custody immediately and allowed to settle with family or friends in the U.S. while their immigration cases wound their way through the courts a process that often takes years.But in recent months the number of families crossing into the U.S. has climbed to record highs pushing the system to the breaking point. As a result ICE was releasing families faster in greater numbers and at points farther removed from the border. Since Dec. 21 the agency set free more than 125000 people who came into the U.S. as families.Trump on Friday was to tour a recently built portion of fence that he is holding up as the answer to stop a surge of migrant families coming to the U.S. in recent months.The White House says itÛªs the first section of his proposed border wall to be built commemorated with a plaque bearing his name and those of top immigration and homeland security officials ÛÒ but not VitielloÛªs.Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

The move is sure to set up a legal showdown between congressional Democrats and the White House.ÛÏItÛªs critical to ensure the accountability of our government and elected officialsÛ Neal said in a statement. ÛÏTo maintain trust in our democracy the American people must be assured that their government is operating properly as laws intend.ÛNealÛªs request for Trump tax returns for 2013 through 2018 went directly to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig.Acting White House Chief of StaffMickåÊMulvaney speaking on ""Fox News Sunday""countered that Democrats will ""never"" see the documents.In a separate request related to TrumpÛªs finances the House Oversight Committee authorized a series of subpoenas for TrumpÛªs accounting firm Mazars Accounting. Chairman Elijah Cummings D-Md.that the firm would respond to the committeeÛªs request for financial documents and audits prepared for Trump and his businesses over the last decade.CummingsÛª committee since the release of the Mueller report has also formally voted to authorize and issue subpoenas for information related to both White House security clearances and the Trump administrationÛªs decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.The committee voted last week to subpoena White House personnel security director Carl Kline over a series of controversial security clearances. As for the census committee Democrats said they wanted specific documents that would determine why Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross decided to add the question.And on the other side of Capitol Hill Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined Rep. Stephen Lynch both from Massachusetts to request an investigation into whether the White House is interfering with or overruling Secret Service recommendations about which guests at TrumpÛªs Palm Beach property Mar-a-Lago should have access to the president.Warren and Lynch penned a letter to the acting inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security requesting the probe citing a series of reports that suggested the resort could be a channel for foreign adversaries to seek influence in federal policy and national security -- after a woman was arrested at the club allegedlycarrying two Chinese passports and malwarAll of these developments have come since March 24 when Attorney General Bill Barr released his summary of the Mueller reportåÊstating the special counsel found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians during the 2016 presidential election.A day after that momentous transmission Pelosi D-Calif. called for renewed focus on a legislative agenda.ÛÏThis is really important today. Because we must with all that is going on stay focused on our purposeÛPelosi said the party needed to focus on ÛÏlower health care costs bigger paychecks and cleaner government.ÛHOUSE JUDICIARY DEMOCRATS AUTHORIZE SUBPOENAS FOR MUELLER REPORBut top Democrats leading prominent congressional committees have instead expanded their existing Trump-focused investigations with some moving in new directions.The push for Trump&amp;apos;s tax returns however was months in the making.Democrats since taking back the majority have had every intention of targeting TrumpÛªs tax files. In January just days after reclaiming the majority Democrats rolled out a broad ethics reform package thatåÊspecificallyåÊrequires presidents to disclose at least 10 years of their tax returns to the public.The topic has been a contentious one since Trump&amp;apos;s time on the campaign trail in 2016 as he refused to abide by past practice of presidential candidates and release his returns.Trump when informed of NealÛªs request said he was still ÛÏnot inclinedÛ to turn over his tax documents.ÛÏWeÛªre under audit despite what people said and weÛªre working that outÛÓIÛªm always under audit it seems and IÛªve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big and I guess when you have a name youÛªre audited. But until such time as IÛªm not under audit I would not be inclined to do thatÛ Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last week.HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE VOTES TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS ON WH SECURITY CLEARANCES CENSUS QUESTIONMeanwhile other Trump-focused investigations on Capitol Hill are ongoing.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff D-Calif. is investigating the presidentÛªs foreign business dealings and Russian election meddling maintaining that despite the results of MuellerÛªs probe there is evidence of collusion.SchiffÛªs panel has also weighed subpoenaing the interpreter who was present for meetings between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to obtain notes from the summits.TRUMP ACCUSES SCHIFF OF &amp;apos;UNLIMITED PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT&amp;apos; AMID NEW PROBThe House Financial Services Committee led by Rep. Maxine Waters D-Calif. is also probing the president coordinating with SchiffÛªs committee on money-laundering inquiries. The House Foreign Affairs Committee chaired by Rep. Eliot Engel D-N.Y. is also involved.Schiff and Waters have together said they would run a joint investigation into Deutsche BankÛÓwhich has done extensive business dealings with the president. Last year Schiff charged that TrumpÛªs financial records with Deutsche Bank and Russia may reveal a ÛÏform of compromiseÛ that ÛÏneeds to be exposed.Û Schiff has long maintained that there had to be some reason that the German banking giant which he said has a ÛÏhistory of laundering Russian moneyÛ was willing to work with the Trump Organization.Trump for his part tried to pivot from investigations into himåÊand encourage Democrats to begin probes instead into the early stages of the Russia probeÛÓlike the Senate Judiciary Committee has announcedÛÓand focus on legislation.ÛÏAccording to polling few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got startedÛÓso illegal!Û Trump tweeted Thursday.Earlier in the week Trump blasted both Schiff and Nadler specifically claiming Democrats would never be satisfied.ÛÏThere is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is not time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!Û Trump tweeted Tuesday.Last month the president accused Democrats of simply """" with their investigations into ""the same nonsense.""But despite PelosiÛªs calls for action she has said she has faith in her committee chairs and their investigations.After the State of the Union in FebruaryÛÏItÛªs our congressional responsibility and if we didnÛªt do it we would be delinquent in that.ÛFox News&amp;apos; Gregg Re and Andrew O&amp;apos;Reilly contributed to this report.Brooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

"Trump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller Reset | RealClearPoliticTrump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller ReseTrump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller ReseTrump's Scattershot Shifts Mar Post-Mueller ReseVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...In the military they call it ""firing for effect.""An artillery battery is fired at a suspected target to see if the enemy moves out of hiding and how heavily the fire is returned. It's a way to quickly assess battle lines and enemy strength without too much reconnaissance but only works ifåÊit's worth giving away oneÛªs ownåÊ position.Over the last week as Donald Trump has launched broadsides on health care and the borderåÊRepublicans are increasingly describing the presidentÛªs salvos in similar terms.Only in their view his go-it-alone approach and failure to coordinate on both the health care and border fronts resulted in friendly fire casualties causing Trump just days later to beat an awkward and hasty retreat weakening all RepublicansÛª strategic positioning in the process.Always aggressively on the advance Trump is in the White House today precisely because he doesnÛªt cede ground to opponents operating in constant combat mode. The bold forceful approach is something Democrats found lacking in President ObamaÛªs all-too-sublime ÛÓ sometimes even aloof ÛÓ approach to political strategy and working with other party leaders and Capitol Hill.And there have been times in which Trump has successfully smoked out DemocratsÛª weaknesses by tossing political grenades their way usually on Twitter after seeing reports on cable news. As David Marcus has Trump isnÛªt just watching TV and surfing Twitter as critics assert; heÛªs researching and influencing.ÛÏHe is seeing what attacks of his are landing and what attacks against himself he can expectÛ Marcus wrote giving the president credit for being his own comms director and dominating the political narrative like no politician before.For example after Nancy Pelosi disinvited Trump from the State of the Union while the government shutdown continued he grounded her Middle East trip literally sending the airport-bound speaker and her delegation home to unpack. The move was a burst from a political flamethrower to be sure and it set Twitter on fire ÛÒ with plenty of his supporters among those joining the fray.WhatÛªs more even some of TrumpÛªs biggest GOP critics who had been busy lighting him up over the shutdown took a moment to delight in the gutsy counterpunch.This past week was not one of those times. At a time when Trump and his base were celebrating the no-indictment conclusion to Special Counsel Robert MuellerÛªs two-year investigation the president squandered his own reset: the opportunity to rally Republicans to his side and build a more united front heading into the 2020 campaign.The 400-page Mueller report which will be released soon will undoubtedly fill the headlines once again with Democrats arguing that the obstruction evidence and other details are far more damaging than Attorney General William Barr let on. The past two weeks were a short window of opportunity for uniting the party which many Republicans say was botched.As heÛªs demonstrated time and time again Trump is skilled at tapping into public anger over the Washington status quo but less adept at channeling it. After all governing and building coalitions is dull tedious work.Instead of focusing on DemocratsÛª internal conflicts their leftward lurch on socialism the improbable Green New Deal and late-term abortions which Republicans in Congress were working overtime to highlight this week Trump launched a foray on an issue ÛÒ health care -- Republicans had already tried and failed to wrest from Democrats and he created a new border-related crisis that divided his own party.The administration went on the Obamacare attack last week when the Justice Department joined a lawsuit to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act ÛÒ even the popular protections for pre-existing conditions. Trump then promised a GOP replacement plan before the 2020 election ÛÒ one he tasked Senate Republicans with formulating to make the GOP the ÛÏparty of health care.ÛHis fellow Republicans collectively groaned. The Senate couldnÛªt repeal and replace the ACA when it only had a third of sitting Republicans up for re-election leading into 2018 compared to Democrats. The GOP will have to defend nearly twice as many seats as Democrats in 2020 guaranteeing gridlock and division on the Republican side of the aisle on health care and other hot-button issues.It took a few days but Trump saw the light and publicly agreed that it would be better to work on health care after the election not before. Still the damage was done and the political seams were revealed for all to see -- and Democrats to attack which they have done with gusto.In fact when House Democrats on Wednesday brought a resolution to the floor condemning Trump for asking the courts to throw out Obamacare eight Republicans voted with them.Then came a new ultimatum over the border. Early this week Trump said that he was ÛÏ100 percentÛ certain he would shut down the U.S. border with Mexico to block a rising influx of immigrants crossing into the country illegally. And he renewed his threat to Congress.ÛÏIf we donÛªt make a deal with Congress the borderÛªs going to be closedÛ he told reporters in the Oval Office. ÛÏ100 percent.ÛHis fellow party members immediately pushed back.As with the earlier government shutdown over funding a border barrier Sen. Majority Whip John Thune said he doesnÛªt believe shutting the border does anything to force Democrats to the table on immigration reform or to help stop illegal immigrants from crossing into the country.ÛÏOne I donÛªt think it accomplishes the purposeÛ he told RealClearPolitics. ÛÏIt forces people to the unsecured areas coming across but they are still going to be coming.ÛÏTwo it makes it very hard to conduct bilateral trade and thatÛªs awfully important for agriculture and other sectors of the economy.ÛThune however said he understands the presidentÛªs frustrations with DemocratsÛª intransigence on immigration reform which he called a ÛÏhuge crisis.ÛMitch McConnell didnÛªt even try to play along with the president. ÛÏClosing down the border would have a potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country and I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thingÛ the Senate majority leader said although he stressed that he agrees with the president that there is ÛÏa border crisis.ÛWhen Trump doubled down by deeming national security more important than trade administration officials who were obviously not consulted struggled to offer some reasonable solution. Larry Kudlow TrumpÛªs chief economic adviser suggested to reporters that both national security and trade are ÛÏessentialÛ ÛÒ not one more than the other.He suggested that the administration was exploring the possibility of keeping one lane of trucking traffic open at the border to ÛÏhelp supply-chain issuesÛ ÛÒ but one can imagine the serpentine lines and truck-by-truck checks such a scenario would require.ÛÏIf you ask me the mechanics of it IÛªm not the guy but that is possible and that will help the supply-chain issuesÛ Kudlow said trying to change the subject to negotiations over the U.S.-Mexico Canada Agreement on trade.By Thursday the president had let Kudlow and other surrogates off the hook to find some type of workaround by backing off the immediate threat to close the border and instead turned to tariff threats. He said Mexico must step up its enforcement and over the next year must prove it is stopping the flow of drugs coming into the U.S.ÛÏIf Mexico doesnÛªt give the help thatÛªs okay. WeÛªre going to tariff their cars coming in to the United States.ÛIt was a second time in a week Trump decided to reverse course on an issue he had raised leading Republicans to publicly and privately grouse about getting caught without warning in the crossfire of the presidentÛªs ÛÏfire for effectÛ impulses.Many congressional Republicans also decided to distance themselves from the administration by cutting off U.S. support for Saudi ArabiaÛªs military campaign in Yemen. The House on Thursday approved a previously passed Senate measure to break U.S. ties with that conflict. The White House vowed to veto the bill.Even though he reversed course on his border threat Trump still plans to head to Calexico California on Friday to inspect a recently completed section of border wall. His supporters believe the pre-planned event will show him in a position of strength spotlighting action on his signature 2016 campaign promise. It will also highlight DemocratsÛª refusal to address what President ObamaÛªs homeland security secretary recently deemed an undeniable immigration crisis.Kudlow and other aides said TrumpÛªs shutdown threat may have caused an intra-party skirmish but it got MexicoÛªs attention. The Mexican government in recent days has agreed to help prevent immigrants from crossing into the United States by adding more checkpoints and allowing people to remain in that country while seeking asylum.ÛÏWe want help from Mexico and by the way it appears we are getting more help from Mexico which is a good thing a great thingÛ Kudlow told reporters Wednesday.ÛÏThe Mexican government is doing better than some on the HillÛ he added.Kudlow explained the threat as ÛÏan exclamation point that shows [TrumpÛªs] seriousness. Û_ HeÛªs flagging to the American people just how committed he is to restoring law and order down there.ÛTrump before departing for California Friday again said he is looking at imposing an ÛÏeconomic penaltyÛ against Mexico in response to drug trafficking and boasted about the number of migrants Mexican authorities had apprehended in the last four days.ÛÏTheyÛªre apprehending everybodyÛ he said. ÛÏItÛªs never happened like that in 35 years.ÛAfter a week of scrambling Trump appeared to be back on solid predictable ground and his fellow Republicans are no doubt thankful for the reprieve ÛÒ however long it lasts.Susan Crabtree is a veteran Washington reporter who has spent two decades covering the White House and Congress.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Other female colleagues have since defendedåÊhis leadership.In a statement to The Detroit News Studley this week criticized the outside investigation as doing ÛÏthe bare minimumÛ to avoid legal liability and failing to fix the problem. The Michigan Legislature is not subject to public records requests under the Freedom of Information Act.ÛÏThe Senate Democratic staff suffers from a culture where smart outspoken women are dismissed excluded and underminedÛ Studley said in the Feb. 3 2017 complaint alleging she was ÛÏsystematicallyÛ excluded from strategy discussions and denied a promotion promised under MulcroneÛªs predecessor.ÛÏI believe I am being treated this way because I am a womanÛ Studley wrote.The NewsåÊhas learned that a second staffer former Ananich press secretary Angela Wittrock also filed two discrimination complaints shortly before quitting in 2016. One was a gender discrimination claim against colleague Michael Zukas and another against a female superior current Communications Director Lisa Keith.Wittrock who confirmed she filed the complaints but declined additional commentåÊsaid in one accompanying narrative that she had brought hostileåÊworkplace concerns to Mulcrone who told heråÊshe needed to just ÛÏlearn to eat a little s---.ÛSarah Studley former legal counsel and senior policy adviser for Senate Democrats filed a discriminatory harassment complaint in FebruaryåÊ2016 against John Mulcrone who remains chief of staff to Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich D-Flint.(Photo: John Mulcrone's Twitter site)She was one of three women who left their jobs with Senate Democrats that year prior to the complaint from Studley who cited the turnover as evidence of wider problems and officially left her own post in July 2017.The complaints were filed with the Senate Business Office which oversees human resources for both political party caucuses. The business office then hired outside counsel to investigate allegations after StudleyÛªs complaint said Amber McCann a spokeswoman for majority Senate Republicans.ÛÏAnd the investigations concluded the complaints had no meritÛ McCann said telling The News that the probe included interviews with ÛÏmultiple parties.ÛAnanich said in a statement he values a ÛÏsafe productive work environmentÛ and takes ÛÏseriously any complaint of discrimination or harassment.ÛÛÏI referred this matter to the non-partisan Senate Business Office when it came to my attention and they hired independent counsel to thoroughly investigate the complaintÛ he said. ÛÏI was prepared to act in accordance with whatever the investigation found and they ultimately found that there was no evidence of gender-based discrimination.ÛSenate Minority Leader Jim Ananich said in a statement he values a ÛÏsafe productive work environmentÛ and takes ÛÏseriously any complaint of discrimination or harassment.ÛBut the depth of that investigation is unknown and Studley criticized it.""Too often when women and minorities sound the alarm about discriminatory demeaning treatment in the workplace they end up getting forced out and nothing gets fixedÛ Studley told The News.ÛÏEmployers should focus on doing the right thing and addressing the problems rather than doing the bare minimum to avoid being sued.""The Senate paid $7500 for the investigation which was conducted by Evans Law Group P.C. of Rochester according to Business Office Director Jordan Hankwitz.The Senate typically does not comment on personnel issues because ÛÏwe would always want to protect their privacyÛ McCann said ÛÏbut this has been outside the normal circumstances of any personnel issue as there is more information out in the public than we would expect.ÛDeputy Chief of Staff Nancy Green who previously worked with Mulcrone under former leaders and rejoined Senate Democrats in September 2017 defended her boss and longtime colleague.ÛÏHeÛªs always been fairÛ she said.åÊÛÏHeÛªs the kind of supervisor and frankly the kind of employee who tries to help other employees. HeÛªs always lifted people up and given people opportunities.ÛGreen noted that sheÛªs earned a promotion a pay increase and been given additional responsibilities working under Mulcrone during the past two years. She is one of several women who currently holdÛÏI donÛªt have anything negative to say about him and IÛªm frankly surprised to see other people criticize him.ÛIn her complaint Studley indicated she had brought general concerns about workplace conditions to Ananich on multiple occasions including a Sept. 9 2016 discussion and a phone chat and subsequent email later that same month.She also alleged Zukas another male staffer who was the subject of a separate complaint from Wittrock had a ÛÏhistory of making sexist remarks and provokingÛ female colleagues but was only reprimanded when he made ÛÏracially insensitive comments not sexist ones.ÛThe 2017 discrimination complaint and material allegations wereåÊmade public by Chris Savage chairman of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party who published StudleyÛªs complaint on his Eclectablog website.ÛÏI donÛªt like to do friendly fire but we have to be better than thisÛ Savage told The News on Wednesday suggesting Democratic efforts to regain a majority in the upper chamber ÛÏdonÛªt stand a chanceÛ if talented female staffers leave because of poor treatment by male superiors.Savage cast doubt on the thoroughness of the Senate Business Office investigation that found the claims without merit.ÛÏMy hope is this spurs a change and this is largely going to have to be on Jim AnanichÛ Savage said. ÛÏHeÛªs the boss of it. People tell me heÛªs a super nice guy but very conflict averse and that seems to be showing itself right now.ÛGreen praised Ananich and questioned why the complaint wasåÊpublished since the investigation had found no fault.""I feel like they're all about lifting people up and helping people do their best"" she said aboutåÊMulcrone and Ananich.

LetÛªs go so we can win everything.ÛJewish voters in the U.S. have traditionally sided heavily with Democrats ÛÒ and are often ideologically liberal ÛÒ but Republicans are hoping to narrow the gap next year in part as Trump cites actions that he says demonstrate support for Israel.Trump earned standing ovations for recounting both the embassy move and the Golan Heights recognition.Trump noted it had long been a priority for Adelson and his wife Miriam. ÛÏThat is the most important thing thatÛªs ever happened in their lifeÛ Trump said. ÛÏThey love Israel.ÛTrumpÛªs speech comes weeks after he suggested Democrats ÛÏhateÛ Jews. His remark followed an internal fight among Democrats over how to respond to comments by Rep. Ilhan Omar D-Minn. that some criticized as anti-Semitic.Trump mockingly thanked Omar as he began his speech before adding ÛÏOh I forgot. She doesnÛªt like Israel I forgot IÛªm sorry. No she doesnÛªt like Israel does she? Please I apologize.ÛHe also accused Democrats of allowing anti-Semitism to ÛÏtake rootÛ in their party.Before TrumpÛªs appearance people assembled for the event carried signs with ÛÏWe are Jews for TrumpÛ and ÛÏTrumpÛ written in Hebrew. Dozens of men and several women wore red yarmulkes with ÛÏTrumpÛ in white that were distributed at the event.Trump also took credit for eliminating hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians and for pulling the U.S. out of several U.N. organizations the U.N. Human Rights Council and UNESCO citing anti-Israel bias in their agendas.Trump criticized some 2020 Democrats who have suggesting they would re-enter the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew the United States. The agreement was fiercely opposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has cheered as Trump re-imposed stringent new sanctions on the country that Israel regards as an existential threat. Trump is closely aligned with Netanayu whoÛªs seeking to return power in TuesdayÛªs national election.Trump predicted that election is ÛÏgonna be closeÛ adding it features ÛÏTwo good peopleÛ seemingly referring to Netanyahu and his chief threat to NetanyahuÛªs coalition former Israeli army chief of staff Benny Gantz.Despite his criticism of Democrats Trump has faced his own criticism from the Jewish community. Trump was slow to condemn white supremacists who marched violently in Charlottesville Virginia in 2017. The previous year he circulated an image of a six-pointed star alongside a photo of Hillary Clinton a pile of money and the words ÛÏmost corrupt candidate ever.ÛPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual leadership meeting Saturday April 6 2019 in Las Vegas.When he addressed the RJC in 2015 he said he didnÛªt expect to earn their support because he wouldnÛªt take their money. ÛÏYou want to control your politicians thatÛªs fineÛ Trump said at the time. Ultimately the group and many of its donors backed Trump.Trump met privately with Adelson before speaking according to an official.

Bernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox News | RealClearPoliticBernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox NewBernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox NewBernie Sanders Is Right to Go on Fox NewVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...One month after the Democratic National Committee declared it would not partner with Fox News for its presidential primary debates leading candidate Sen. Bernie Sandershe would participate in an April 15 Fox News town hall. Those on the left who donÛªt want Fox to be treated as a legitimate news outlet quickly voiced their disapproval.Carolyn Fiddler communications director of Daily Kos which organized a successful petition calling for the DNC to deny FoxÛªs requests to host presidential debates told the ÛÏI donÛªt know why he would lend his considerable presence to a network that routinely pushes sexist and racist tropes about progressives and his supporters.Û Katherine Krueger managing editor of the progressive-- who likes Sanders because he makes ÛÏthe right people irrationally angryÛ -- urged him to reconsider: ÛÏThe ones who are already tuned into Fox News when that town hall starts arenÛªt going to move an inch on this pinko socialist.ÛSanders is correct to ignore the naysayers though perhaps not for the reasons heÛªs offered.Defending his decision onSanders said going on Fox News will help flip Donald Trump voters: ÛÏI think it is important to talk to those people and say Û÷You know what? I know that many of you voted for Donald Trump but he lied to you. He told you for example he was going to provide health care to all people; now he wants to throw 30 million people off the health care that they had. He told you that he was going to give tax reform that would not benefit the wealthy; 83% of the benefits go to the top 1%.Ûª I think it is important to talk to Trump supporters and explain to them to what degree he has betrayed the working class of this country and lied during his campaign.ÛThis is pretty naÌøve if not delusional. Though Sanders is correct that the president has sporadically and inconsistently tacked left on health care and taxes TrumpÛªs signature issue has always been restricting immigration. Sanders wonÛªt be saying anything on Fox that will change the average Trump voterÛªs mind on that score.Furthermore as the shift toward Democrats in the 2018 House election indicates anyone who voted for Trump on the grounds that he would expand access to health care and slap new taxes on the wealthy doesnÛªt need Bernie Sanders to inform them that didnÛªt happen.SandersÛª youngest rival South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg had a somewhat more plausible argument for appearing on Fox News himself: ÛÏThere are so many viewers who may never hear what our party has to say at all if weÛªre never going on [Fox News] and explaining what we believe.Û This may seem fruitless if you assume that every Fox viewer is an immovable blindly loyal right-wing Republican. But in a 2014 study of media consumption by the Fox was the third-most popular news source among people with ÛÏmixedÛ ideological views and for those ÛÏmostly liberalÛ it came in fourth.Granted that doesnÛªt translate into big portions of the Fox audience. Only 8% of the ÛÏmixedÛ audience and 5% of the ÛÏmostly liberalÛ audience cited Fox as their main news source. Still these numbers are not zero. Considering that Democrats would have won the White House in 2016 if they flippedin three Rust Belt states they canÛªt be picky about where they go to hunt down hard-to-reach swing voters.But while going out of oneÛªs way to reach those voters for the general election makes sense the Fox News audience is not a treasure-trove of voters that Democrats need to win the presidential. So whatÛªs the point of going on Fox at this stage of the process?The answer is: Democratic primary voters should get the opportunity to see how their candidates deal with questions from a conservative perspective even if they are loaded with unfair right-wing talking points.After all the eventual nominee is not going to run in a vacuum. She or he will face plenty of sharp attacks from the right and how well Democrats respond says a lot about how viable they would be in November 2020.said ÛÏIÛªm willing to bet serious money that this ends up being a whole bunch of pointed questions about the Green New Deal about why Sanders wants to take away the private insurance we all love so much and about some newspaper column he wrote decades ago with a question about the deficit thrown in for good measure.ÛWe should hope so! If Sanders doesnÛªt have good responses to pointed questions about his democratic socialist agenda maybe his agenda isnÛªt ready for prime time. If he does then he has an even stronger case to make why he should be the nominee and why his agenda should be enacted.The questions for Sanders will likely be pointed but not nasty. The moderators for town hall wonÛªt be Trump boosters Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson; they will be straight-news anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. As Sanders reminded ÛÏThe Daily ShowÛ viewers he did a Fox News town hall in 2016 with Baier who ÛÏdid it straightforwardly. Believe me we went over the ground rules beforehand and they kept their word.ÛThat town hall which was coupled with one for Hillary Clinton made news because ÛÓ unlike in the 2016 Democratic debates to date ÛÓ Baier asked a question about abortion. And it was a question that reflected the interests of socially conservative Fox News viewers: ÛÏCan you name a single circumstance at any point in a pregnancy in which you would be okay with abortion being illegal?Û After Sanders did not name one Baier followed up by suggesting ÛÏthere are some Democrats who say after five months with the exception of the life of the mother or the health of the baby that perhaps thatÛªs something to look at.ÛThis was a heavily slanted phrasing of the question. Democrats werenÛªt the ones pushing constitutionally questionable abortion bans after 20 weeks without any exemptions for the health of the mother. Republicans were. To assign that view to ÛÏsome DemocratsÛ makes the pro-choice position seem extreme.But guess what? Candidates can be asked questions by journalists and even voters with unfair wording. You may not believe this but sometimes a candidateÛªs opponent levels attacks in an unfair manner. Politics is not always fair! A strong presidential contender needs the skills to turn such questions and attacks to his or her advantage. What better way for a Democratic candidate to show off those skills by tackling head-on questions with a conservative skew?Democrats may not want to legitimize Fox News. But no amount of shunning is going to make it go away. The Democratic nominee will have to function in a world in which Fox exists and conservative talking points are well amplified. Keeping the Democratic presidential candidates coddled in a partisan cocoon during the primary is not going to prepare the eventual primary winner for what is to come.Bill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show ÛÏThe DMZÛ and host of the podcast ÛÏNew Books in Politics.ÛåÊHe can be reached at contact@liberaloasis.com or follow him on Twitter @BillScher.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

Trump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor China | RealClearPoliticTrump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor ChinTrump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor ChinTrump Fights to Fix Shipping Rates That Favor ChinVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Did you know that it costs significantly more to mail a package to Boise from Boston than it does from Beijing?According to the U.S. Postal Service itaround $20 to mail a small parcel weighing 4.4 pounds from one U.S. state to another yet mailing the same package from China only costs about $5. Millions of Americans who have purchased consumer goods online from Chinese sellers for a few bucks shipping included have likely noticed this disparity first-hand.This shipping differential is the product of the U.S. government subsidizing Chinese shipments. The governmentUSPS delivers Chinese goods at a 40% to 70% discount losing money on each package it delivers.This unfair dynamic hurts U.S. small businesses whose bottom lines are increasingly reliant on e-commerce because it allows China to dump its often-counterfeit products in the U.S. market at an artificially low cost. And it sticks taxpayers with the tab because they are on the hook for bailing out the government-funded USPS. Yes you read that right. Uncle Sam allows this to happen and is ultimately to blame. With a friend like this who needs enemies?The Universal Postal Union a United Nations agency that sets postal rates among its 192-member countries dictates USPS's artificially low rates. It bizarrelyChina ÛÒ the worldÛªs second-largest economy ÛÒ with developing nations like Gabon andinto its third tier of shipping rates which are just a fraction of what the developed world must pay.Successive U.S. presidents have turned a blind eye to this injustice.åÊUntil now. The Trump administration has made correcting this shipping status quo a priority. Last month the federal Advisory Committee on International Postal and Delivery Services a unit of the State Departmentto discuss its plan to reform UPU rules to allow the U.S. to self-declare rates for inbound delivery rather than follow UPU diktat. Self-declaration is already standard for larger packages that weigh more than 4.4 pounds.the U.S. would begin to withdraw from the UPU entirely -- a process that takes one year to complete -- while simultaneously seeking to renegotiate UPU terms.retain the U.S. as a member UPU officials are meeting this month to consider the U.S.Ûªs proposal.the world's mail goes through the U.S. the UPU would be wise to accept the administrationÛªs offer. If it refuses to do so Trump shouldn't let bureaucratic inertia at the State Department slow down his order to extricate the U.S. from this bad deal by this October.Consider some examples of how this current shipping dynamic is hurting U.S. small businesses. Jayme a small New Jersey travel mug manufacturer$6.30 to ship a mug domestically. His Chinese counterparts sell knock-offs of his product for $5.69 including free shipping all the way from China. Becca Peter a WashingtonåÊstate designer packaging tape manufacturer$3.50 for domestic shipping. Her Chinese competitors charge just $2 for their version of the product shipping included.Bigger businesses and franchises such as the recently bankrupt Radio Shack and Toys R Us are also negatively affected. Arthur Herman a senior fellow at the Hudson Institutehow an electric voltage measurer cost $24.99 at Radio Shack versus $15.82 at Deal Extreme a Chinese e-commerce company. At this price differential many Americans would have purchased at Radio Shack given its reputation and return policy. Yet factor in shipping -- $5.95 at Radio Shack versus free at Deal Extreme ÛÒ and all of aare being asked to pay twice as much to purchase their product domestically. Herman argues this dynamic helped kill Radio Shack.on Chinese imports -- losing aboutit delivers. Given that China will deliver hundreds of millions ofåÊsmall packages this year eliminating this postal subsidy would be enough to move USPS from the red into the black when it comes to Chinese imports.Until this happens USPS will be forced to continue raising domestic shipping ratesrecoup losses as it has done in recent years. This means taxpayers and American shippers are effectively subsidizing Chinese merchants.Reforming UPU rules has received broad support from across the political spectrum. It is a non-controversial way to level the playing field to help U.S. small businesses compete fairly against their Chinese competitorsåÊwhile also improving the trade deficit.Whether UPU terms are reformed to allow the U.S. to self-declare its own rates or whether the U.S. leaves the Swiss-based organization altogether the days of something costing less to mail across the world than across the county line are numbered. Get ready to chalk up another victory for U.S. small businesses and taxpayers under President Trump.Alfredo Ortiz is the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

On this date 101 years ago a Chicago couple named Hortense and William Bloomer welcomed their third child into the world a baby girl they named Elizabeth. William Bloomer was a traveling salesman for the Royal Rubber Co. and his work took the family to Denver briefly before they settled in Grand Rapids Mich. the place Elizabeth Bloomer would always consider her hometown even after she became a fixture in Washington D.C. -- and a widely admired first lady known as Betty Ford.Another presidential election is upon us it would seem -- the campaign season now lasts a full two years -- and in time we will focus on the personal lives of the nominees especially their significant others. The incumbent presidentÛªs wife conspicuous for her beauty reticence and elegance is an immigrant. ÛÏI was born in SloveniaÛ Melania Trump told Americans in her 2016 speech at the Republican National Convention. ÛÏA small beautiful and then-communist country in central Europe.ÛShe was only the second first lady born abroad. The first was Louisa Catherine Adams wife of John Quincy Adams whose father was an American serving as U.S. consult in London.IsnÛªt it interesting to think who will next don this amorphous mantle first worn by Martha Washington and now sported by Melania?The current Democratic Party field includes four female senators all married to men little-known in political circles a congresswoman from Hawaii and a male mayor from a small Midwestern city married to a man. The election of any of them would result in a historical first -- more than one in some cases. ThatÛªs what makes history so interesting.A dozen years ago if I told you Cory Booker could be president you might have wondered if America was ready for an African-American president. Now if you think about Sen. Booker breaking the mold youÛªd be wondering about something else: Namely when was the last time a bachelor moved into the White House? (It was Grover Cleveland in 1886).But hereÛªs the rub: Whoever moves into that house with the president will be a woman or a man with distinctive gifts who will sacrifice his or her privacy and normalcy for a job without an official title and that doesnÛªt pay a dime in salary. Yet if history is any guide that person will have untapped gifts and strengths that can be a source of inspiration to us all. A person like Betty Ford. IÛªll have more on her in a moment First I'd point you to RealClearPolitics' which presents our poll averages videos breaking news stories and aggregated opinion columns spanning the political spectrum.

In RealClearDefense Mackenzie Eaglenthat the White House has yet to nominate a replacement for James Mattis despite pressing policy and other demands.The Paradoxes of a Martian OceaThe future Betty Ford whom IÛªve written about before in this space was born onåÊAprilåÊ8 1918 in Chicago. A lithe and active little girl Betty showed an early aptitude for dance which she later described as ÛÏmy happiness.ÛShe was 16 when her father died from carbon monoxide poisoning and her passion became a source of income for the family. As the Great Depression took hold Betty Bloomer gave dance lessons to make ends meet and modeled at a Grand Rapids department store. She had bigger plans though and after graduation from high school she was accepted at the Bennington School of Dance in Vermont where she became a protÌ©gÌ© of famed choreographer Martha Graham whom she followed to New York.Reluctantly acceding to her motherÛªs entreaties Betty returned to Grand Rapids and immersed herself in the community: opening her own dance studio working as a fashion coordinator in a local department store and dating a salesman named Bill Warren.In this last endeavor her mother's domineering personality backfired. As Betty explained in her 1978åÊautobiography ÛÏMy mother and stepfather were not enthusiastic about Bill Warren which made him all the more alluring to me.ÛBut a spirit of rebellion isn't enough to sustain a marriage and this one dissipated after five years. Then along came another suitor an All-American football player from Michigan just out of the Navy -- a handsome and ambitious fellow named Gerald R. Ford.Betty married Jerry Ford campaigned with him followed him to Washington after he was elected to Congress raised four kids with him and then followed him into the White House when he unexpectedly became president during the crucible of Watergate.As first lady Betty Ford openly endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment emerging as a then-unlikely prototype: Republican mother and feminist. And if some White House aides preferred her to be a little less outspoken the president wouldnÛªt hear of it.Shortly after becoming first lady Betty discovered a lump in her right breast. By openly confronting the cancer and the ensuing mastectomy she helped de-stigmatized a disease that women of her generation often hid setting an example that has almost certainly saved and prolonged the lives of untold numbers of American women.An even greater challenge awaited. A year after they left the White House for California -- just before BettyÛªs 6birthday -- the Ford family did an intervention: Her twin addictions to alcohol and pain medication were killing her her family insisted and it was killing them to watch it.Betty checked into the Long Beach Naval Hospital with its anti-dependency program a stint that she credited with saving her life. In gratitude she immersed herself in the issue. She spoke about it publicly as was her wont and launched the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage California.ÛÏShe was a great liberatorÛ presidential scholar Richard Norton Smith said at her 2011 funeral. ÛÏShe not only liberated women she liberated us from the crippling limits of labels. Mrs. Ford was the feminist next door a free spirit with a dress code. Above all she was a wife and mother.ÛÛÏShe had so many contributions so many lives she changed for the better and even saved by her example and her effortÛ added Lynne Cheney. ÛÏShe not only became her own woman but showed many others how to do the same.ÛSteve Ford's remembrances that day induced both tears and laughter among the mourners especially when he described his mother's disbelief when he confided to her his own alcoholism.ÛÏYou can't be in denialÛ he told her. ÛÏYouÛªre like Betty Ford. You're the poster child for this thing!ÛThose tributes were delivered at the church where she and Jerry Ford had been married nearly 63 years earlier. Her Christian faith was deep and she was ready to go to the other side as she had told her children. Referring to their father whoÛªd passed away in 2006 Betty said she wanted to be reunited ÛÏwith my boyfriend.ÛCarl M. Cannon is the Washington Bureau Chief for RealClearPolitics.

"Building a Healthy Political System | RealClearPoliticBuilding a Healthy Political SysteBuilding a Healthy Political SysteBuilding a Healthy Political SysteVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...It's no secret that America's political system is badly broken so ScottRasmussen.com decided to find out what voters think is wrong.We began by exploring what voters think is needed to create and maintain a healthy political system. Four items were deemed ""Very Important"" by at least 7 out of every 10 voters: freedom of speech (77%) having political leaders who respect voters (76%) checks and balances between branches of government (73%) and freedom of religion (71%).Five other items were considered Very Important by a majority of voters: freedom of the press (63%) clear limits on what the government can do (62%) political leaders who are willing to compromise (61%) respect for people with fundamentally different views (61%) and limits on taxation (54%).Next we asked whether each of those items is present in America today. We found that most voters believe three of those nine Very Important attributes are missing in America today.-- By a 25% margin (59% to 34%) voters do not believe our political leaders respect American voters.-- By a 29% margin (61% to 32%) voters do not believe we have political leaders who are willing to compromise.-- By a 9% margin (51% to 42%) voters do not think most Americans have respect for people with fundamentally different views.It's interesting to note that all three have to do with attitudes guiding the political process. It's not about the mechanisms of government or violation of rights; it's about the people engaged in the process of governing.That same frustration is evident in other data showing just 27% believe the federal government primarily serves the interest of the American people. More than twice as many -- 60% -- believe it primarily looks out for its own interests. In other words a solid majority of voters see the federal government as a very powerful special-interest group.The perceived self-interest of those in the political game is found repeatedly in our survey work.-- Eighty-two percent of voters believe the top leaders of federal regulatory agencies often use their position to pursue their own personal agenda. Voters believe that rather than serving the public interest these officials are intent on imposing their standards on the rest of the nation.-- Fifty-three percent of voters think it is somewhat likely that their own representative in Congress trades votes for cash. Only 23% are confident that their representative isn't cashing in like that.Add it all up and it's easy to see why just 18% of voters trust the federal government to do the right thing most of the time. This is not something new. It's been 47 years since a majority of voters trusted the federal government.Not coincidentally that ongoing distrust coincides with the explosive growth of the regulatory state that began in the 1970s. A key objective of the regulatory state was to free government officials from accountability to voters. The unsurprising result has been a broken political system in which political leaders do not need to respect the voters.Making the regulatory state more accountable is essential to creating a healthier political system. But we don't need a new set of rules. We need something even more difficult to obtain something we haven't seen among the political elites for a very long time -- respect for the American people.Log In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Monday May 1 2017 after he unveiled a new rule on school lunches as the Trump administration and other Republicans press for ...By Jonathan Butcher and Vijay MenonThe National School Lunch Program has changed dramatically since it began in 1946. What started as a grant program to help poor students and those with special needs has morphed into a massive entitlement offering meals to 30 million students every year ÛÓ equivalent to nearly 55% of all children enrolled in public and private schools.And the bigger the program got the more wasteful it became. The Office of Management and Budget now classifies the school lunch program as a ÛÏhigh-errorÛ program due to large losses from incorrect payments each year ÛÓ nearly $800 million in FY 2018 alone.In 2010 the Obama administration approved letting school districts offer free meals to all students in schools where 40% of the student body come from low-income families that qualify for public assistance such as food stamps. This ÛÏCommunity Eligibility ProvisionÛ is providing meals ÛÓ breakfast as well as lunch ÛÓ to kids from middle- and upper-income families.Federal regulations adopted to implement these changes to the lunch program further stretched the eligibility criteria. Districts have been permitted to combine the percentages of eligible students across groups of schools so they can offer free meals to students in schools that donÛªt meet the 40% threshold.For example if only 20% of the students in School A are eligible for free meals but 61% of School BÛªs students meet the criteria the district can ÛÏcombineÛ the numbers and provide free meals to all students in both schools.ThatÛªs problematic for taxpayers ÛÓ and those who believe free food should be reserved for students truly in need.President TrumpÛªs 2020 budget proposal would put an end to this practice of grouping schools together. The idea is to provide ÛÏbetter targeting [of] free meal benefits to children in need of assistanceÛ the original purpose of federal school meals.It would be a small but worthwhile improvement to a program that has been plagued by waste for years. The school lunch program has a habit of serving the wrong students which is why it lands on OMBÛªs black list with lamentable regularity. As of 2016 the lunch program had an error rate of 16% while the school breakfast component had an improper payment rate of 23%.The 2010 expansion of taxpayer-funded meals only aggravated this problem because it ignores the errors by simply including more students regardless of family income. The program was already wasting food before taking in middle- and upper-middle class ÛÏbeneficiariesÛ who had no need ÛÓ or appetite ÛÓ for the food on offer. Adding students to the program does not address these issues of waste.The rationale behind the expansion was that it would give low-income families access school meals because they no longer have to apply for them. Yet other methods already in use work to more easily identify eligible students.For example over 90% of students from families participating in the food stamp program are automatically made eligible for free school meals. ThereÛªs no need to give free meals to students who are not poor in order to help those who are.The 2010 Community Eligibility Provision runs contrary to the purpose of the school lunch program and should be eliminated entirely. Instead of watching taxpayer money get tossed into school trash cans lawmakers should work to reduce waste and redirect resources to children in need.Jonathan Butcher is a senior policy analyst in the Heritage FoundationÛªs Center for Education Policy.

New York Democrats launch fresh bid to dig up TrumpÛªs tax returns | Fox NewNew York Democrats launch fresh bid to dig up TrumpÛªs tax returnTrump 2020 campaign: Voters want the president's agenda not his tax returnNew York state Democrats launched a new effort Monday to pave the way for the release ofstate tax returns ÛÒ a move New YorkÛªs GOP chairman called ÛÏludicrousÛ ÛÏpartisanÛ and illegal.Under New York tax law it is illegal to share someoneÛªsDEMS RAMP UP ANTI-TRUMP PROBEBut on Monday state Sen. Brad Hoylman introduced S5072 which would amend the law and require the commissioner of taxation and finance ÛÏto cooperate with investigations by certain committees of the United States Congress under certain circumstancesÛ ÛÒ a bid to let the state share tax return information specifically TrumpÛªs with congressional committees that request it.ÛÏThis new bill will permit New York State to comply with requests from congressional investigative committees and help ensure Congress canÛªt be blocked in their attempts to hold even the highest elected officials in the land accountable to the American peopleÛ Hoylman said in a statement.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler D-N.Y. said in a statement that the bill could help Congress get tax returns if blocked at the federal level ÛÒ an apparent reference to an effort by another House committee to get six years of TrumpÛªs returns directly from the IRS.ÛÏThis legislation would make the work of a federal committee a little easier if confronted with inability to receive the federal tax return we can turn to New York StateÛ Nadler said.Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said onthat Democrats will ÛÏneverÛ see the presidentÛªs tax returns ÛÏnor should they.ÛMULVANEY VOWS DEMS WILL NEVER SEE TRUMP TAX RETURNEd Cox the chairman of the New York State Republican Party called the latest legislation from New York Democrats ÛÏludicrous.ÛÛÏThis is so political so aimed at Donald Trump no matter how they disguise it otherwiseÛ said Cox who predicted the issue will go all the way to the Supreme Court. ÛÏI suspect it will be ruled to violate equal protection laws and be deemed a bill of attainder.ÛA bill of attainder is an unconstitutional legislative act that singles out an individual or group for punishment without a trial. Cox argues the Democratic majority and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are trying to change the law for political gain.ÛÏThey are trying to re-litigate the 2016 election. ItÛªs called Trump Derangement Syndrome and in the process they arenÛªt doing the business of the people of New York state. Instead they are playing politics including the governor who is running hard to be presidentÛ Cox said.ÛÏTransparency and disclosure is vital but tax return privacy is also important and we should not politicize the process -- however Governor Cuomo believes elected officials on all levels should be prepared to release their taxes if they enter public service and he would include state and local as well as federal officials in any legal revisionÛåÊsaidåÊRich Azzopardi a senior adviser to Cuomo.The governor has said he will not make a 2020 presidential run and has said former Vice President Joe Biden has the ÛÏbest caseÛ among the Democratic contenders. But in a profile in The Atlantic Cuomo suggested that ÛÏifÛ Biden chooses not to run he could throw his hat in the ring.The push for S5072 follows the January introduction of a bill by New York Assemblyman David Buchwald that requires the disclosure of tax returns by statewide elected officials including the president.On the steps of the state capitol in Albany Buchwald and Hoylman touted that legislation the New York Truth Act as critical.ÛÏWhy is it important that we have access to the presidentÛªs tax returns? It is because those tax returns reveal conflicts and potential conflicts of interest. They show whether the president has been in full compliance with our tax laws and they also show what the implications are to him of proposals he makes to amend the tax laws in this countryÛ Buchwald a former tax attorney said at the press conference.While similar efforts have failed in the past state Democrats suggest this yearÛªs could gain traction. Buchwald said 93 Assembly members and a majority 32 state senators support the Truth Act.ÛÏThere is a copy of President TrumpÛªs tax returns right here in New York state in an office somewhere and the only thing that prevents that state income tax return from being made public is a state statute that we in the state legislature should have the power to amendÛ Buchwald said.Trump has shown little interest in turning over the documents as the White House braces for a fight.ÛÏWeÛªre under audit despite what people said and weÛªre working that outÛÓIÛªm always under audit it seems and IÛªve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big. ...

Trump administration designates IranÛªs Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group - Daily PresTrump administration designates IranÛªs Revolutionary Guard a terrorist grouVahid Salemi / Associated PresIranian Revolutionary Guard members arrive for a ceremony celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution at the Azadi or Freedom Square in Tehran on Feb. 11. (Vahid Salemi / Associated Press)In an effort to tighten political and economic pressure on Tehran the Trump administration moved Monday to brand Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization an unprecedented move against another nationÛªs military that the Pentagon had resisted.President Trump issued the announcement from theafter months of harsh rhetoric against Iran and an onslaught of sanctions aimed at crippling its economy.In a statement Trump said the guard ÛÏactively participates in finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraftÛ and is the Iranian governmentÛªs ÛÏprimary means of directing and implementing its global terrorist campaign.ÛÛÏThis action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequencesÛ Trump said.Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo said the terrorist designation will take effect in one week.Netanyahu says Trump named IranÛªs Revolutionary Guard a terrorist group at his request åÈAlthough the Revolutionary Guard plays a major role in the Iranian economy the U.S. penalties may have limited impact because the group already is under U.S. sanctions. The designation however could complicate U.S. military and diplomatic missions notably in Iraq where many Shiite Muslim militias and Iraqi political parties have close ties to the guard.U.S. military and intelligence officials have raised concerns that the designation may bar them from meeting foreign officials in contact with Revolutionary Guard personnel. Those concerns are one reason previous administrations did not make the move which was considered for more than a decade.But administration officials said Monday that exceptions would be made for U.S. personnel as needed. U.S. diplomats talk with the Taliban in Afghanistan another group listed as a foreign terrorist organization noted Nathan Sales the State DepartmentÛªs coordinator for counter-terrorism.Some military experts warned the decision could endanger U.S. troops one reason for long-standing concerns at the Pentagon.Iranian officials quickly warned of consequences for U.S. troops in the Middle East. The countryÛªs foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called for U.S. Central Command which oversees American forces in the region to be designated ÛÏa terrorist group under Iranian law.ÛMohammad Ali Jafari commander of the guard warned that ÛÏthe American army in West Asia will see the end of tranquilityÛ according to the semiofficial Fars news agency.In Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing a hotly contested bid for a fourth term tweeted on the eve of the election that Trump had acted at his request.ÛÏThank you my dear friend the president of the United States Donald Trump for having decided to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organizationÛ he wrote in Hebrew on Twitter. ÛÏThank you for responding to another of my important requests which serves the interests of our countries and countries of the region.ÛHe later posted a thank-you note in English that did not take credit but said of Trump: ÛÏOnce again you are keeping the world safe from Iran aggression and terrorism.ÛTrumpÛªs move was viewed in Israel as a gift to the prime minister. Shimrit Meir a Middle East analyst tweeted that ÛÏthe timing of course is last-minute help from afar for pal Netanyahu.ÛThe Trump administration has targeted what it calls IranÛªs malign behavior since it took office and withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord partly over those concerns. The administration cites IranÛªs support for militant groups in Syria Lebanon Iraq and Yemen as well as a perceived threat against Israel.This is the first U.S. designation of an entire foreign government entity although portions of the Revolutionary Guard notably its elite Quds Force have been targeted in the past.The Revolutionary Guard ÛÏwill take its rightful place on the same list as the terror groups it supportsÛ Pompeo said.The designation allows the Revolutionary GuardÛªs assets to be frozen abroad and will complicate efforts by European and Asian companies and governments to do business with Iran. The elite military group is involved in numerous aspects of the Iranian economy.It also makes it a U.S. crime to do business with the group or provide material support for its activities.Brian Hook the administrationÛªs special representative for Iran said the designation will deprive Iran and the Revolutionary Guard of funds needed to carry out policies that he said include assassinations and threats to U.S. military personnel.Hook said the designation will ÛÏmake radioactiveÛ any aspect of the Iranian economy that deals with the guard.ÛÏThe Middle East cannot be more stable and peaceful without weakeningÛ the Revolutionary Guard Hook said calling it the ÛÏblunt instrumentÛ of Iranian-sponsored terrorism.Behnam Ben Taleblu an Iran hawk at the conservative Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington said the designation reflected the Revolutionary GuardÛªs growing influence in IranÛªs ÛÏforeign and security policy as well as the terror apparatus.ÛThe designation was announced a day before elections in Israel where an embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long sought the listing and has long enjoyed TrumpÛªs support.In a tweet Zarif the Iranian foreign minister called it ÛÏa misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu. A(nother) dangerous U.S. misadventure in the region.ÛAnalysts in Tehran said the designation is unlikely to change IranÛªs strategies or policies.Ahmad Bakhshayesh an analyst and former member of parliament said IranÛªs hardliners will likely be emboldened. Officials may cite the designation as evidence that any effort to resume nuclear negotiations with the U.S. would be counterproductive.The Revolutionary Guard ÛÏis the pillar of the Islamic Revolution inside and outside the countryÛ Bakhshayesh said.ÛÏIran will try to barter with Turkey Iraq and Russia to avoid dependency on the American dollar and other hard currencies to compensate [for] the repercussions of todayÛªs designation.ÛBakhshayesh predicted further devaluation of IranÛªs rial already buffeted by U.S. economic sanctions.The State Department designates 60 groups as foreign terrorist organizations including Al Qaeda Islamic State and their affiliates Hezbollah and numerous militant Palestinian factions. The IRGC is the first state-run military force.Wilkinson reported from Washington and Etehad from Los Angeles.

"Democrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the Wealthy | RealClearPoliticDemocrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the WealthDemocrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the WealthDemocrats Want to Restore Tax Break for the WealthVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Democrats often complain that tax cuts primarily benefit ÛÏthe richÛ but apparently they only think itÛªs a problem when rich conservatives get a tax break because theyÛªre outraged that President TrumpÛªs tax cuts scaled back a generous subsidy enjoyed by well-off taxpayers in liberal states.A key provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a new cap on the so-called State and Local Tax (ÛÏSALTÛ) Deduction which allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes on their federal tax return. This provision forces taxpayers in low-tax states such as Florida and Texas to effectively subsidize those in high-tax states such as New York and California.For years blue-state Democrats have been able to raise state income and property taxes far higher than voters might normally tolerate. ThatÛªs because the SALT deduction softened the impact for taxpayers in those states particularly for the rich campaign-donor class. Since the SALT deduction only applies to taxpayers who itemize their returns its benefits naturally accrue to those in the highest income bracket.There was previously no limit to how much taxpayers could deduct through SALT but even though the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act capped the deduction at $10000 almost 93 percent of American taxpayers will be unaffected. ItÛªs likely that fewer taxpayers will elect to take advantage of SALT since the law also doubled the standard deduction but about 11 million of the highest-earning Americans living in high-tax states are seeing their federal income tax liabilities increase.ItÛªs curious that liberals who criticized Trump so vociferously for ÛÏcutting taxes on the wealthyÛ are so upset by an element of the tax reform plan that merely takes away a tax break enjoyed disproportionately by the wealthy.Take New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for instance. His state has some of the highest tax rates in the country yet it is nonetheless facing a $2.3 billion budget deficit. Cuomo is blaming the changes to the SALT deduction saying that wealthy New Yorkers are now shifting their assets to other states or utilizing tax shelters to avoid the stateÛªs punitive taxes.It turns out that without low-tax states paying a share of their taxes rich New Yorkers and Californians have discovered that it makes more sense to relocate. I certainly did. California where I used to live has a top marginal income tax rate of 13.3 percent. Tennessee where I hang my hat now has none ÛÓ at least on regular income. The barbeque is better here too!In CuomoÛªs case most of his wealthy New Yorker donors were probably wintering in Florida anyway. Bad luck for him that Florida doesnÛªt have a state income tax either because if they start lining up for Florida driverÛªs licenses in any significant numbers itÛªs going to bankrupt the Empire State.Most of the high earners left in these predominately coastal liberal strongholds have stuck around mainly because the SALT deduction gave them a hefty discount on their state taxes. In New York for instance the average SALT deduction was $22000 before the reform. That money came straight out of the pot that pays for national defense interstate transport national parks and all the other federally funded services that Americans depend on.Donald TrumpÛªs historic tax reform has put an end to all of that and Democrats are up in arms. Four high-tax states are even suing to get their money back arguing that the federal government has a responsibility to provide lavish tax breaks to their richest residents.Next time you hear Democrats complain about ÛÏtax cuts for the richÛ remember that theyÛªre the same ones who are going to the mat to protect tax breaks for wealthy liberals at the expense of middle-class Americans in low-tax states.Andy Puzder was chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants following a career as an attorney.

The second conspiracy one is involving manipulation of intelligence that also could ensnarl many Americans.""FBI BLAMES &amp;apos;SYSTEM WIDE SOFTWARE GLITCH&amp;apos; FOR MISSING STRZOK PAGE TEXTS --- STRZOK&amp;apos;S MUELLER PHONE TOTALLY WIPENunes asserted that ""we&amp;apos;ve had a lot of concerns with the way intelligence was used"" during the Trump-Russia probe.Just nine days before the FBI applied for a FISAåÊwarrant to surveil Carter Page then a Trump campaign aide bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the applicationaccording to internal text messages obtained by Fox News in March.Redacted versions of FISA documents already released have revealed that the FBI extensivelyåÊrelied ondocuments produced byåÊChristopher Steel an anti-Trump British ex-spy working for a firm funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to surveil Trump aide Carter Page. The FISA application did not clearly state that the firm was funded by the Clinton team and DNC.The leaked dossier and related FBI surveillancekickstarted a media frenzy on alleged Russia-Trump collusiothat ended with a whimper last month when it was revealed Special Counsel Robert Mueller&amp;apos;s probeconcluded finding no evidence of such a conspiracåÊdespite several offersåÊby Russians to help the Trump campaign. Page was never charged with wrongdoing and he isåÊcurrently suing the DNC for defamation.DOJ guidelines preclude the FBI from omitting exculpatory evidence or misrepresenting sources in FISA applications.-- and Republicans have charged -- that the FBI improperly withheld evidence that would have suggested their surveillance targets during the Trump probe were in fact innocent.FBI INCORRECTLY ASSURED FISA COURT ON FOUR OCCASSIONS THAT YAHOO NEWS ARTICLE WAS INDEPENDENT BASIS TO SPY ON TRUMP AID""The third is what I would call a global leak referral"" Nunes said.åÊ""So there are about a dozen highly sensitive classified information leaks that were given to only a few reporters over the last two-and-a-half-plus years. So you knowåÊwe don&amp;apos;t know if there&amp;apos;s actually been any leak investigations that have been opened but we do believe that we&amp;apos;ve got pretty good information and a pretty good idea of who could be behind these leaks.""Nunes specifically named a series of known ""horrific""åÊleaks including the leak of conversations between Trump and theleaders of Australia and Mexic and the transcripts of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn&amp;apos;s calls.Nunes noted that the eight criminal referrals could involve more than eight people and that a conspiracy referral could involve ""a dozen two dozen people."" He added that more referrals could be coming.""I think it&amp;apos;s impossible to ignore"" Nunes said. ""If the Mueller team was busting people for lying to the FBI --åÊthere are some pretty simple times when people lied to Congress for the sole purpose of obstructing our investigation.""(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Defending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free Speech | RealClearPoliticDefending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free SpeecDefending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free SpeecDefending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free SpeecVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Many in the United States worry about the erosion of democratic norms. Too few however exhibit concern for the steady deterioration over the last half century of the essential democratic norm of free speech.True the United States remains an exceptional experiment in free and democratic self-government. Of all the Western-style liberal democracies the nation ÛÏconceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equalÛ ÛÓ as Lincoln put it in 1863 at Gettysburg ÛÓ is grounded in the oldest written constitution sustains the largest economy enjoys the greatest diversity possesses the largest capacity for projecting force around the world and shoulders the most extensive responsibility for preserving the freedom and openness of the international order. Yet the increasing hostility of influential segments of its population to free speech ÛÓ not least speech that affirms American exceptionalism ÛÓ shows the United States to be in an unwelcome respect all-too-similar to fellow Western liberal democracies.The growing scorn for free speech in the United States ÛÓ on campuses in Silicon Valley and Hollywood and in human resource departments and on corporate boards of all sorts of commercial enterprises ÛÓ is on a collision course with the U.S. Constitution. Free speech is inscribed in the First Amendment following religious freedom and followed by freedom of the press and ÛÏthe right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.ÛIts position in the text of the First Amendment symbolizes free speechÛªs indissoluble connection to religious liberty and political liberty. One can neither worship (or not worship) God in accordance with oneÛªs conscience nor persuade and be persuaded by fellow citizens if government dictates orthodox opinions and punishes the departure from them. Indeed the more authorities ÛÓ whether formally through the exercise of government power or informally through social intolerance ÛÓ prescribe a single correct view and demonize others the more citizens lose the ability to form responsible judgments and defend the many other freedoms that undergird human dignity and self-government.In the mounting hostility toward free speech within its borders the United States is not alone argues Andrew A. Michta in The American Interest. ÛÏDemocracies across the West are at an inflection point on free speechÛ he contends inThe Rise of Unfreedom in the WestÛÏand itÛªs not clear which way things will go on this issue in the next 20 or 30 years.ÛThe problem is manifold. ÛÏIn some cases ostensibly liberal governments have already made moves to police and suppress what they deem unacceptable speech; in others rigid political binaries have threatened to crowd out traditions of free inquiry and debateÛ Michta writes. ÛÏAll too often it seems not to matter what is said in an argument but rather who says it and how it was said.ÛThe dean of the College of International and Security Studies at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies Michta grounds his dire diagnosis in concrete empirical evidence. Barely a quarter ÛÏof American adults believe they have true freedom of speech.Û Ninety percent of American universities censor speech or maintain policies that could authorize administrators to engage in censorship. In 2017 Germany enacted a law that obliges social media networks to be more ÛÏdiligent in policing Û÷hate speechÛª on their platforms.Û The next year France adopted a similar law. A substantial plurality of British voters in 2018 believed that people do not feel free to express their opinions on ÛÏimportant issues.Û And an annual report to the Council on Europe concludes that press freedom in Europe is in MichtaÛªs words ÛÏmore fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War.ÛIn both American and European societies according to Michta the tyranny of public opinion not only dictates what one may not say but also decrees what one must affirm. In both societies ideological litmus tests govern public discourse. The notion that lively give-and-take is the route to public consensus is fading.Elite opinion in the West Michta maintains not only leans left but seeks to silence the right. For much of the academic media and political establishments progressive opinions glow with righteousness while viciousness and ignorance indelibly stain conservative convictions.Cultural and political elites besmirch caring for oneÛªs own nation as xenophobia. They fervently embrace globalization. They trumpet their commitment to save the planet while pressing for impossibly expensive and utterly unworkable environmental measures. They revile the popular desire to preserve traditional morality and the nationÛªs inheritance even as they take for granted ordinary peopleÛªs humanitarian conscience.The WestÛªs descent into unfreedom argues Michta stems from the aggressive promulgation of ideas at odds with liberty and limited government. In the 1960s a critical mass of university professors used their tenured positions not merely to argue for but to institutionalize the belief that to achieve a just society it was necessary to sweep aside the fundamental principles and institutions of liberal democracy.Over the last 20 years the neo-Marxist students ÛÓ and students of the students ÛÓ of the Ûª60s generation have intensified attacks on free speech. Neo-Marxist thinking replaces the proletariat with a bevy of identity-based groups whose claim to authority arises from their success in portraying themselves as victims of bias and oppression which they maintain are deeply embedded within the West. Like MarxÛªs proletariat ÛÓ or those bourgeois intellectuals whom Marx declared would break from their class and speak on the proletariatÛªs behalf ÛÓ the neo-Marxists assert that by virtue of their grievances they have acquired a monopoly on the truth.The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe 30 years ago and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that followed argues Michta ÛÏcarried a hidden threatÛ that further damaged the WestÛªs commitment to free speech. The great victory of democracy and freedom in the Cold War over communist totalitarianism convinced Western elites that they were uniquely suited to bring democracy and freedom as they uniquely interpreted it to the entire globe.This conceit had perverse domestic ramifications. According to Michta it ÛÏcontained within it the seeds of arguably the greatest peril the West has ever confronted: the ideological certitude ÛÓ not just on the Left ÛÓ that we had cracked the code of the human condition and could get on with the work of perfecting both the individual and society.Û Ideological certitude hardened at the very moment that communismÛªs defeat deprived the West of ÛÏa living exampleÛ of the costs of social engineering on a mass scale. ÛÏAnd so at its moment of triumphÛ writes Michta ÛÏthe West fell victim to a post-Enlightenment delusion of the perfectibility of man.ÛThat delusion fuels the self-consuming scorn many intellectuals in the United States as well as in Europe direct at the principles of liberal democracy. At universities AmericaÛªs founding promise of individual freedom and equality under law is often treated as irredeemably tainted by racism and sexism colonialism and imperialism. In some cases free speech is placed on the list of ÛÏincorrect phrasesÛ that ought not be uttered because it belongs among the ÛÏimpure thoughtsÛ of which minds must be cleansed.In light of long-term trends those who care about the erosion of democratic norms in the United States ÛÓ and who believe that that the United States can serve as a model to fellow liberal democracies ÛÓ would do well to focus their energies on upholding the constitutional requirements of free speech cultivating tolerance and learning to benefit from a diversity of opinion.Peter Berkowitz is the Tad and Dianne Taube senior fellow at the Hoover Institution Stanford University.

"Beto twists Trump words on MS-13 in defending comparison to Nazis | Fox NewBeto twists Trump words on MS-13 in defending comparison to NaziBeto O'Rourke comapres Trump's immigration rhetoric to Nazi GermanO'Rouke Castro compare Trump to the Third Reich; reaction from former ICE director Tom Homan and Catalina magazine founder Cathy Areu.made headlines in recent days for comparing President TrumpÛªs immigration rhetoric to that of Nazi Germany -- but twisted the president&amp;apos;s words in the process.In Iowa last week the formersaid the Trump administration&amp;apos;s family separation policy ""follows the rhetoric of a president who not only describes immigrants as rapists and criminals but as animals and an infestation.""BETO DOUBLES DOWN ON CALL TO ABOLISH ELECTORAL COLLEGHe added: ""Now I might expect someone to describe another human being as an infestation in the Third Reich. I would not expect it in the United States of America.""Later Thursday O&amp;apos;Rourke defended his comments when asked by reporters if he was comparing the Trump administration to Nazi Germany:åÊ""Calling human beings an infestation is something that we might&amp;apos;ve expected to hear in Nazi Germany. ... Describing immigrants -- who have a track record of committing violent crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans -- as rapists and criminals. Seeking to ban all Muslims -- all people of one religion -- what other country on the face of the planet does that kind of thing?""He continued: ""Putting kids in cages? Saying that neo-Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists are &amp;apos;very fine people&amp;apos;? ... [T]his is not something that I expected to hear a president of the United States ever say.""O&amp;apos;Rourke covered a lot of ground in the comments referencing family separations at the border as well as the so-called travel ban and Trump&amp;apos;s controversial comments after the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville -- criticism at least rooted in Trump policies and remarks.But his claim that Trump referred broadly to immigrants as an ""infestation"" took the president&amp;apos;s words significantly out of context. In the original comments -- a tweet -- Trump used the word ""infestation"" in reference to MS-13 gangs.ÛÏWhen we have an Û÷infestationÛª of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws in our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do!Û Trump tweeted last July.Shortly before that Trump posted a slightly broader tweet using the term ""infest"" but largely in reference to illegal immigrants and specifically MS-13.O&amp;apos;Rourke similarly accused the president of referring to immigrants as ""animals"" -- though that too has been disputed.ÛÏYou wouldnÛªt believe how bad these people are. These arenÛªt people these are and weÛªre taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate thatÛªs never happened beforeÛ Trump said last May.Democrats including now-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. criticized the president for his rhetoric at the time. But Trump and his allies argued he was only referring to MS-13.BETO O&amp;apos;ROURKE PICKING OFF SUPPORT FROM PRIMARY RIVALS OUT OF THE GATTrump even doubled down on his comments saying MS-13 gang members are ÛÏnot people.ÛÛÏThese are animals and we have to be very very toughÛ Trump said.OÛªRourke announced his 2020 presidential bid last month after a close defeat in his 2018 Senate race against Sen.

I think they really slowed us downÛ President Donald Trump told reporters Friday.(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP)President Donald Trump called on the Federal Reserve to open the monetary floodgates to turn the worldÛªs largest economy into a ÛÏrocket ship.ÛÛÏI personally think the Fed should drop rates. I think they really slowed us down. ThereÛªs no inflation. I would say in terms of quantitative tightening it should actually now be quantitative easingÛ he told reporters as he departed the White House on Friday. ÛÏYou would see a rocket ship. Despite that weÛªre doing very well.ÛThe request for Fed assistance to boost growth came just after a Labor Department report showed another healthy sign for the durability of an expansion that may become the longest on record by midyear. The jobless rate held near a 49-year low and employers added more workers than economists forecast in March. The report showed little sign of wage inflation.Trump is breaking with longstanding Republican criticism of the FedÛªs large balance sheet and embracing a loose monetary policy that in effect helps finance the nationÛªs debt load. He repeatedly criticized the Fed under President Barack Obama for holding down interest rates and the use of quantitative easing which at the time was an effort to lower long-term borrowing costs by buying Treasury bonds and mortgage securities.Stocks gained after TrumpÛªs remarks. The S&amp;P 500 Index just posted its biggest quarterly advance in almost a decade. A segment of the Treasuries yield curve the difference between 3-month and 10-year rates narrowed Friday though traders say that move began after the March jobs data was released. The gap was at around 7.5 basis points from 8.7 basis points Thursday. The spread inverted last month for the first time since 2007.ÛÏWe donÛªt even know what to make of TrumpÛªs commentÛ said Ian Lyngen head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.Trump has regularly called for rate cuts but his advice on the balance sheet went further into a debate thatÛªs mostly been among economists and investment professionals.In the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago the Fed bought government bonds and mortgage-backed securities in a strategy called quantitative easing aimed at lowering longer-term market rates after cutting its main policy rate close to zero. That swelled the Fed balance sheet to a peak of $4.52 trillion in early 2015.As the economy strengthened in recent years the central bank has allowed the securities to mature without reinvesting proceeds which some call ÛÏquantitative tightening.Û The balance sheet tally recently was $3.94 trillion.Central bankers in March held the benchmark lending rate in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent and said they would start slowing balance-sheet shrinkage in May and halt the draw-down altogether at the end of the September. Their forecasts showed they plan to hold their policy rate unchanged this year.In another effort to influence Fed policy Trump plans to nominate two political loyalists for the FedÛªs board of governors: former GodfatherÛªs Pizza Inc. CEO Herman Cain and Stephen Moore a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Their qualifications for the board have been questioned by economists and many lawmakers and neither has been formally nominated.TrumpÛªs top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the appointments arenÛªt intended to undermine the FedÛªs traditional political independence. ÛÏWe are not going after their independenceÛ Kudlow said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. ÛÏWe have our point of view.ÛFed rate increases last year drew criticism from the president who even discussed firing Chairman Jerome Powell.Kudlow observed that inflation is low even as wages rise. ÛÏWhy raise interest rates?ÛRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2019/04/06/trump-fed-economy/39307717/,0

(AP) - A proposal to enshrine the rights of crime victims in the Pennsylvania Constitution was approved overwhelmingly Monday in the state House moving it avote away from going before voters in a referendum.PennsylvaniaÛªs proposed version of MarsyÛªs Law which passed 190-8 would give victims the right to be notified to attend and to weigh in during plea hearings sentencings and parole proceedings.Supporters say the amendment will help ensure victims are not ignored during court proceedings.But opponents warned it could infringe on the rights of criminal defendants to get a fair and speedy trial. They argue that its wording is vague and that itÛªs difficult to predict how judges will enforce it.ÛÏIf you put it into a constitutional amendment thatÛªs a very rigid thing and hard to changeÛ said Rep.

The proposed amendment would give victims legal standing to go to court if those existing rights are violated according to the state district attorneysÛª association.The Department of State has said the referendum could make the November ballot if it passes the gets reviewed by the attorney generalÛªs office and is ready to be advertised by Aug. 5.

Michael Bennet on cancer diagnosis: 'I donÛªt see this stopping me' from 2020 run | Fox NewMichael Bennet on cancer diagnosis: 'I donÛªt see this stopping me' from 2020 ruSen. Bennet hopes President Trump signs the border deal: It's a reasonable compromissays heÛªs optimistic heÛªll soon be running for president.The two-term Colorado Democrat ÛÒ who announced last week that he recently was diagnosed with prostate cancer ÛÒ told Fox News ÛÏI feel really lucky. It was caught early and this is a really treatable form of cancer and we have insurance. I think IÛªm going to be fine. I hope I willåÊbecause I really want to have the opportunity to run in 2020.ÛBennet was interviewed Sunday as he campaigned in New Hampshire the state that holds the first primary in the race for the White House.BENNET ANNOUNCES HE HAS PROSTATE CANCEPointing to then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts ÛÒ the 2004 Democratic nominee who had successful cancer surgery at the onset of his presidential campaign ÛÒ Bennet 54 said ÛÏJohn was 59 when he had the same operation. He had it and two weeks later he was in California doing what he needed to do out there to campaign. So I take this seriously but if all goes well I donÛªt see this stopping me.ÛBennet didnÛªt bring up his diagnosis during a question-and-answer session with the Rockingham County Democrats that lasted over an hour butåÊmembers of the crowd wished him well.ÛÏI donÛªt feel the need to bring it up myself. IÛªm glad to talk about it if people want to raise itÛ he told Fox News.The diagnosis apparently hasnÛªt slowed Bennet down on the campaign trail. The Exeter event was the second to last in a jam-packed two-day swing through New Hampshire. On Monday heÛªs headed to Iowa which votes first in the presidential caucus and primary calendar.BENNET CRITICIZES REP. OMAR&amp;apos;S COMMENTS AS &amp;apos;HATEFUL&amp;apos;Bennet who said he had planned to declare his candidacy for president this month explained that he hoped to jump into the White House race a few weeks after next weekÛªs surgery if he gets a clean bill of health.That wouldnÛªt leave a lot of time for Bennet to make the stage at the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates set for late June.ÛÏWeÛªve made it a little bit harder on myself although I wouldnÛªt have asked for this issueÛ he explained. ÛÏI think itÛªs important to be on the debate stage whether itÛªs the first debate or the second debate however youÛªre able to do it and we will work to get on there. I donÛªt want to make excuses for it but we slowed down a little bit.ÛFIRST 2020 DEBATES TO BE HELD IN JUNWhen Bennet likely jumps into the race heÛªll be facing off against a large field of Democratic contenders (it currently stands at 17) many with bigger name ID and bigger campaign war chests. And thereÛªs already a candidate from Colorado in the race. The stateÛªs former two-term governor ÛÒ John Hickenlooper ÛÒ launched his campaign last month.Many of the leading contenders are supporters of the single-payer ÛÏMedicare for AllÛ health care proposal a top wish-list item for the progressive base of the Democratic Party.However Bennet isnÛªt endorsing ÛÏMedicare for All.Û Instead he teamed up with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia to come up with a plan called ÛÏMedicare-XÛåÊwhich would establish a public option for people maintaining their private insurance.ÛÏI wouldnÛªt even call it extreme or left wing or too progressive or any of that stuffÛ Bennet said when asked about ÛÏMedicare for All.Û ÛÏI know people out there want to have a public option to compete with private insurance. I know they want to have a choice and I know they donÛªt want to be dictated by the federal government what that choice has to be. ThatÛªs how I developed the idea for &amp;apos;Medicare X.&amp;apos;ÛHe touted that his plan is ÛÏmore achievable.ÛAnd pointing to President TrumpÛªs efforts to scrap ObamaCare Bennet argued that ÛÏwe have a president who has spent his administration trying to take health care away from millions of Americans.ÛBennet who served as superintendent of the Denver public school system before first winning election to the U.S. Senate in 2010 highlighted his push to reform education.ÛÏThis will make me unelectable but IÛªll say it on the first day ÛÒ I think kids should go to school six days a week. And I donÛªt think they should go to school nine months a year. I think they should go to school off and on year-roundÛ Bennet told the crowd.He highlighted that year-round school would narrow the achievement gap saying that ÛÏin the summertime the more affluent kids gain proficiency the less affluent kids lose proficiency.ÛHe alsoåÊstressed that ÛÏthis is a place with a lot of low hanging fruit where we can make an enormous difference... with some very smart strategic (federal) funding we can revolutionize community colleges in this country and we could change dramatically what weÛªre doing in K-12.ÛBennet also urged that Democrats ÛÏneed a president and leadership in Washington thatÛªs as strategic asÛ Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APÛÏItÛªs not about nice.

Trump is returning from a trip to California and Nevada. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)A U.S. judge decided Monday to block the Trump administrationÛªs policy of returning asylum seekers toas they wait for an immigration court to hear their cases but the ruling is on hold for several days.Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco granted a request on behalf of 11 asylum seekers from Central America and legal advocacy groups to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward but he held off on enforcing his decision until Friday to give the government a chance to ask an appeals court for a review.The policy lacks sufficient protections to ensure migrants donÛªt face ÛÏundue risk to their lives or freedomÛ in the judge said. Seeborg also said a law that President Donald TrumpÛªs administration cited as its authority to send back migrants does not apply to asylum seekers such as those who sued.It was not immediately clear whether the administration would ask an appeals court to put the ruling on hold. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment.The launch of the policy in January at the nationÛªs busiest border crossing - in San Diego - marked an unprecedented change to the U.S. asylum system government officials and asylum experts said. Families seeking asylum typically have been released in the U.S. with notices to appear in court.The Trump administration says the policy responds to a crisis at the southern border that has overwhelmed the ability of immigration officials to detain migrants. Growing numbers of families are fleeing poverty and gang violence in Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador.The ruling came a day after Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned and as the administration faces repeated court setbacks on strict anti-immigration measures that were a signature campaign promise for Trump including losses on such policies as separating families at the border and ending protections for young immigrants.The lawsuit says the Trump administration is violating U.S. law by failing to adequately evaluate the dangers that migrants face inUnder the new policy asylum seekers are not guaranteed interpreters or lawyers and donÛªt get to argue to a judge that they face the potential of persecution or torture if they are sent back to Judy Rabinovitz an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union said at a March court hearing.Seeborg said in his ruling that ÛÏfurther procedural protections would be required to conform to the governmentÛªs acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.ÛThe ACLU and other groups also argue in the lawsuit that a law allowing the return of some immigrants todoes not apply to asylum seekers who cross the border illegally or arrive at a border crossing without proper documents.Seeborg agreed saying the ÛÏplain languageÛ of the law supported that interpretation.ÛÏTry as it may the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United StatesÛ Rabinovitz said in a statement after the ruling.The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait inwill discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800000 cases.Justice Department attorney Scott Stewart said at the March hearing that there was a process to protect immigrants who could face harm in. All 11 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are represented by attorneys and 10 already have appeared for court proceedings he said.Border Patrol arrests the most widely used gauge of illegal crossings have risen sharply over the last year but are relatively low in historical terms after hitting a 46-year low in 2017.The launch of the policy followed months of delicate talks between the U.S. and. Mexicans and children traveling alone are exempt from it.Copyright å© 2019 The Washington Times LLC.The Washington Times Comment PolicThe Washington Times welcomes your comments on Spot.im our third-party provider.

Wheeler is telling CBS News in an interview airing Wednesday morning that climate change is ÛÏan important issueÛ but that most of the threats it poses are ÛÏ50 to 75 years out.Û(Photo: Andrew Harnik / AP file)ÛÓ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler defended the Trump administration's decision to pullåÊout of talks withåÊCalifornia about new rules for gas mileage.Speaking to reporters Thursday at the WashingtonåÊAuto Show Wheeler said he is confidentåÊtheåÊTrump administration's proposal to roll back stringent rulesåÊthat would require automakers to produce fleets that average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025 will hold up in court if it is successfully finalized later this year.""Our goal from the beginning was a 50-state solution"" he said. ""I met with (the California Air Resources Board) three times since taking the helm of EPA last July. But despite our best efforts we could not reach a solution and decided to end the discussions. We embrace federalism and the role of states but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate the standards for the entire nation.""Asked what would happen if California proceeds with a lawsuit that has already been filed over the proposal to rule back mileage rulesåÊWheeler said:åÊ""We'll go to court if they do that. I believe we're on firm legal footing and I believe that our standards will be upheld by the courts.""The TrumpåÊadministration announced last year its intention to ease stringent gas-mileage rules that would have required fleets averaging more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The administrationåÊproposedåÊa freeze in the mandate after 2020 when their lineups must average 39 mpg.Automakers cheered the decision to reopen the so-called midterm review they were promised when the Obama-era gas mileage rules were agreed to in 2011. But they hoped the Trump administration would quickly reach an agreement with California on a new set of rules to prevent a lengthy legal battle that would leave the mpg requirements for the next half-decade in limbo.The Trump administration has floated the idea of moving to revoke a longstanding waiver allowing California and other states to set their own stricter auto emissions standards. Thirteen states and Washington D.C. have adopted CaliforniaÛªs mileageåÊrules meaning automakers could be left with one set of rules for a quarter of the country and another set for the remaining states.Revoking California's waiver which is ensconced in the Clean Air Act would require an act of Congress that is unlikely with the U.S. House under Democratic control.Wheeler said the Trump administration is focused on making sure new cars are affordable enough for consumers to purchase new models that are more fuel-efficient.""Our overarching goal is to get more AmericansåÊinto newer safer cleaner vehicles"" he said noting that the average age of a car on U.S. roadways is more than 12 years.WheeleråÊtouted the EPA's enforcement actions against automakers that have been investigated for emissions violations. The agency reached an $800 million settlement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles this yearåÊto resolve allegationsåÊfromåÊfederal regulators thatåÊthe company used software on about 104000 diesel-powered pickups and SUVs that isåÊsimilar to ÛÏdefeat devicesÛåÊused by Volkswagen AGåÊto cheat U.S. emissions-testing.""We're committed to vigorously enforcing the nation's environmental laws"" Wheeler said Thursday. ""EPA has stopped the sale of over 1 million after-market defeat devices...In this year alone we've stopped roughly 2220 illegal vehicles and engines atåÊthe border and held the importers and the manufacturers accountable for many more illegal foreign products.""Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/04/04/epa-chief-defends-decision-pull-out-california-mpg-talks/3362660002/",0

McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well-respected by members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects TrumpÛªs priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.ÛÏI have determined that it is the right time for me to step asideÛ Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. ÛÏI hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure AmericaÛªs borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationÛªs discourse.ÛHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielse(Photo: Jacquelyn Martin / AP)Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake-up at Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination for another key immigration post the development Sunday was unexpected.Nielsen traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed TrumpÛªs comments on the situation at the border though she ducked out of the room without explanation for some time while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers Nielsen was at TrumpÛªs side introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward on a Coast Guard Gulfstream as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.Nielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether sheÛªd be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning though she was not forced to do so they said.Nielsen is the latest person felled in the Trump administrationÛªs unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials brought about by the presidentÛªs mercurial management style insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.Nielsen was also the highest profile female Cabinet member and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and the White House staff itself without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary Jim Mattis was pushed out in December over criticism of the presidentÛªs Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January following John KellyÛªs resignation last year.Her resignation lett er lacked any sense of controversy ÛÒ unlike those of others who have left. She thanked Trump and DHS staff for their hard work.Her replacement McAleenan has helped shape many of the administrationÛªs policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders the White House and Homeland Security officials. But itÛªs unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary after her predecessor Kelly became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.Once Kelly left the White House NielsenÛªs days appeared to be numbered. She had expected to be pushed out last November but her exit never materialized. During the government shutdown over TrumpÛªs insistence for funding for a border wall NielsenÛªs standing inside the White House even appeared to rise.But in recent weeks as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign tensions flared anew.The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello ÛÒ a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller an immigration hardliner and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views the people said.Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday but when there was no time she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March over half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers ÛÒ scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday ÛÒ was postponed.Nielsen dutifully pushed TrumpÛªs immigration policies including funding for his border wall and defended the administrationÛªs practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens ÛÏin the United States every day.Û But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.Under Nielsen migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for some 12000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3000 families and facilities are at capacity.She also advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and often said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online ÛÒ not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2018 election.She led the federal agency since December 2017 and was this administrationÛªs third Homeland Security secretary. A protege of KellyÛªs he brought her to the White House after Trump named him chief of staff. She earned a reputation as an enforcer working to corral the chaotic West Wing.Nielsen 45 previously served as a special assistant to President George W. Bush and worked for the Transportation Security Administration.She rose through the Trump ranks quickly ÛÒ joining the transition team after the election to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process. She quickly became a trusted aide to Kelly and the two worked together to impose order on a dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command.House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson D-Miss. said her tenure was ÛÏa disaster from the start.Û The policies she helped create ÛÏhave been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.ÛHis Senate counterpart Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis. said the government needed ÛÏsteady informed and effective leadership in the administration and in Congress to have any hope of fixing our out-of-control border security and immigration problems.ÛAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.This story corrects the month in which border agents are on track to make 100000 arrests and denials of entry to March not this month.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/07/kirstjen-nielsen-resign/39313917/,0

"Brexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic Toll | RealClearPoliticBrexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic TolBrexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic TolBrexit Hasn't Even Happened yet Ireland Is Already Seeing Signs of the Economic TolVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...DUBLIN -- One doesn't necessarily expect to find an advanced manufacturing operation in the Donegal Gaeltacht one of the last rural redoubts where the Irish language can be heard in everyday life. Yet there Irish Pressings is producing tooling and parts for the auto industry. Since it was founded the company has grown steadily even during the most brutal parts of the financial crisis.Irish Pressings planned to grow even bigger this spring because the company expected a major contract from Honda for one of its new models. News of the contract had prompted a weekend-long celebration -- followed by devastation in February when Honda announced that it was shutting the factory in England where the car was to be made. Honda said the decision wasn't Brexit-related but in 2018 an executive had detailed the company's concerns about problems that would be caused by Britain's leaving the European Union.Declan Ward Irish Pressings' managing director says his firm will be fine because its policy is not to spend money on expansion until a contract is firmly in hand. Nonetheless losing the Honda job was a blow to an employer in an area that desperately needs this kind of economic development.Much of the speculation about Brexit over the past few years has focused on how it would affect the British and Irish economies. Remainers have occasionally exaggerated just how bad it would be -- even if Britain crashes out of the EU with no agreement to organize its trade with other countries Britons are not going to be boiling up their shoes for dinner.That said a no-deal Brexit is likely to be disastrous enough. Josh Hardie deputy director general of the Confederation of British Industry estimates shipments through the Port of Calais Britain's gateway to Europe would fall by 50% in the immediate aftermath. For consumers that would mean shortages of certain goods and long queues. For businesses it would mean a major economic shock one that would of course eventually hit workers' paychecks. And while leaving the EU might not be fatal to London's place as a world financial center some job losses are inevitable. Last year Bank of America relocated to Dublin moving about 100 jobs from London to its Irish subsidiary.But that doesn't mean Ireland expects to do well out of Brexit. An Irish government study released last month estimated that a disorderly no-deal Brexit would cause job losses in the tens of thousands over the next decade in a country with a population of less than 5 million. Ireland sends most of its agricultural exports to Britain and much of the rest of its trade uses Britain as a land-bridge to the rest of Europe. A hard Brexit would be very hard on Ireland.And as Irish Pressings' experience suggests you don't actually have to wait for Brexit to see economic ripple effects across both sides of the Irish Sea. With Brexit says Ward ""The damage is already done. There's been a dramatic decline in car buying.""The uncertainty over the shambolic Brexit political process is making matters worse. Mark Sharkey the chief executive of the Cope a retail cooperative near Irish Pressings recalls starting to plan for a hard Brexit and asking his suppliers what they were doing. He says he was startled when they replied ""Very little"" but it was understandable. With everything in doubt how can you plan?Companies waiting to discover whether Britain is going to leave and how are withholding investment -- or steering investments elsewhere. And as Hardie told me ""Once a hundred-million pound investment has gone somewhere else it's not coming back."" And of course some of the follow-on investments that otherwise would have been made will instead flow toward the money's new home.But the changes taking place in the British economy aren't necessarily visible in the headline gross domestic product figures and that may actually be making things worse. If the uncertainty had crashed Britain into a recession politicians might have been forced to come to some orderly timely arrangement. But GDP grew at a rate of 1.4% in 2018 -- not stellar but not catastrophic either.Even more perversely the uncertainty has spurred some of the growth: British firms are building up their inventories in case a no-deal Brexit suddenly cuts off supplies. That has given the British economy lately a healthier glow than it merits. Even in an orderly Brexit or a canceled Brexit the glut of goods will depress output in future quarters.Eventually something will have to happen with Brexit and eventually Irish Pressings and British industry will muddle through; the Cope will cope. But every day that politicians dither is another day of damage to businesses -- and another day for firms to look beyond the British market toward places where the path forward seems clearer.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0
"Private-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in Egypt | RealClearPoliticPrivate-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in EgypPrivate-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in EgypPrivate-Equity Fund Sparks Entrepreneurial Energy in EgypVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...CAIRO -- You can't find many success stories in America's sour sullen relationship with Egypt over the past decade. Mostly it's been a tale of mutual suspicion thanks to erratic American policy and growing Egyptian political repression.But talking with Amal Enan a 33-year-old Egyptian economist you realize what a healthy relationship could accomplish. She runs the Cairo office of an innovative little-noticed development project that's quietly backed by the two governments known as the Egyptian American Enterprise Fund.This private-equity fund using money appropriated by Congress is helping finance new small and medium-size businesses that are creating jobs and entrepreneurial energy in the sometimes moribund statist Egyptian economy. Starting with $300 million the fund has had a roughly 19% internal rate of return over the past four years Enan says.With President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi visiting Washington later this month it's a good time to think about projects like this that can help the Egyptian people rather than the military and the regime. There's a trust gap with the Egyptian public: America has alienated nearly every segment of the population here since 2011 -- by jettisoning pro-Western President Hosni Mubarak that year then looking the other way during el-Sissi's 2013 coup against Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and then shunning el-Sissi.The Egyptian-American relationship was a jewel of U.S. foreign policy four decades ago with the Camp David peace agreements but those days are long gone. Yet Egypt still matters in the Arab world and a mutual repair process makes sense. The story of the Enterprise Fund illustrates how this reset could begin.Enan met meåÊlast Sunday in downtown Cairo at a hotel next to Tahrir Square the epicenter of the Arab Spring rebellion in 2011 that ousted Mubarak empowered Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and then boomeranged with a takeover by the Egyptian military through then-Gen. el-Sissi. The regime now suppresses journalists comedians actors and even this week Egypt's cherished soap operas.Tahrir Square is largely empty these days physically and emotionally. Cairo itself seems a noisy but somewhat joyless city where half-filled tourist boats ply the Nile and Egyptians seem united above all in resenting the United States. There's so little interest in American studies these days at the American University in Cairo that the department has been looking for other missions.Enan is an encouraging counterpoint. A Cairo University graduate who received an MBA from Harvard Business School she demonstrates the intellectual capital that's abundantly available in Egypt despite the autocratic regime. The fund's investments similarly show the business creativity that's bubbling under the lid.The fund's strategy was to jump-start private-equity markets that could finance startups and innovative companies. To assemble and manage its portfolio the fund chose an Egyptian investment firm Lorax Capital Partners. The Egyptian government was wary at first but gradually embraced the project.The fund's portfolio illustrates the opportunities that exist in Egypt and other so-called ""frontier"" markets. The first investment was in a company called Fawry an electronic-payments firm that has 120000 outlets throughout Egypt; its market value has quadrupled since the fund invested in 2015. Next came Sarwa Capital a consumer-finance company that recently went public at three times its early valuation; the fund also backed Orchidia one of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies in Egypt.To incubate growth the fund invested in Algebra Ventures a local venture-capital fund and Flat6Labs which helps local tech entrepreneurs start businesses. Around this U.S.-backed nexus other private-equity firms have begun to invest too.The Egyptian-American fund is the brainchild of James Harmon who ran the Export-Import Bank during the Clinton administration and then founded the Caravel Fund which invests in an emerging and frontier markets. Harmon argues that political reform will be impossible in Egypt without a dynamic economy that can create jobs.Harmon thinks the Trump administration should build on the success of the Enterprise Fund and create similar enterprise funds in other countries that need growth and prosperity. He's right; Congress is already considering such a fund for Jordan.Another obvious candidate for such a venture is Central America which badly needs new local businesses that can hire people -- and keep them from attempting a desperate migration across America's southern border. That strikes me as a no-brainer.American foreign policy often focuses on giving countries political advice -- which in Egypt and many other countries has created a backlash of popular resentment. The Enterprise Fund idea is instead to give them capital to start new businesses. The balance sheet presented by Enan suggests this is one American strategy that actually works.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

One analyst says that warmed over hippie fare is being cleverly recycled on the political landscape as 2020 looms and competition becomes more intense.ÛÏAll DemocratsÛª Û÷newÛª ideas are just repackaged failures that baby boomers like. Û÷Medicare for AllÛª anti-nuclear sentiment universal basic income court-packing and doing away with the electoral college are old boomer ideas repackaged as something newÛ writes a senior contributor at The Federalist.ÛÏCourt packingÛ is expanding the size of the Supreme Court to 15 judges by the way.ÛÏThe Democratic Party or at least its 2020 presidential candidates and new stars are allegedly lurching significantly leftward.

President Donald Trump says heÛªs got better things to do than attend the ÛÏboringÛ and ÛÏnegativeÛ White House CorrespondentsÛª Association dinner.Trump said Friday heÛªll hold one of his signature political rallies as counter-programming to the glitzy April 27 press dinner skipping the event for the third year in a row.ÛÏThe dinner is so boring and so negative that weÛªre going to hold a very positive rally insteadÛ he said.Presidents and first ladies have traditionally attended the event a fundraiser for college scholarships where politicians journalists and celebrities mix. A number of reporting awards also are distributed at the dinner.Trump has not attended the dinner since he took office but had suggested he might appear this year after organizers scrapped the usual format featuring a comedian and instead invited Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow to speak.Association President Olivier Knox said in a statement: ÛÏWeÛªre looking forward to an enjoyable evening of celebrating the First Amendment and great journalists past present and future.ÛTrump who has long had an adversarial relationship with the news media also held rallies on the same night as the dinner in 2017 and 2018.

Bernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-Runner | RealClearPoliticBernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-RunneBernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-RunneBernie Sanders Finds Himself in a New Role as Front-RunneVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...DAVENPORT Iowa (AP) ÛÓ Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is quieting critics who questioned whether he could recapture the energy of his upstart 2016 campaign surpassing his rivals inåÊearly fundraisingåÊand establishing himself as an indisputable front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.Less than two months into hisåÊsecond White House bidåÊ no other declared candidate in the crowded Democratic field currently has amassed so many advantages: a $28 million war chest a loyal and enthusiastic voter base and a set of clearly defined policy objectives.That puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns which he has not yet released. He initially blamed ÛÏmechanical issuesÛ for the delay and his campaign now says he wants to wait until after the April 15 tax filing deadline to fulfill hisåÊpromise to release a decade worth of returnsåÊ.Sanders has largely embraced his new front-runner status. More than any other candidate he draws explicit comparisons with President Donald Trump in his campaign remarks previewing his approach to a general election faceoff with the incumbent Republican. Behind the scenes Sanders is also building out a larger more diverse campaign operation responding to criticism that his 2016 organization skewed too heavily white and male. Campaign officials say the 2020 campaign staff ÛÓ roughly 100 people and growing ÛÓ is majority female and 40 percent people of color.Still SandersÛª message and style hasnÛªt changed from 2016 when he stunned many Democrats by mounting a formidable challenge to Hillary Clinton and besting her in more than 20 primary contests.After briefly acquiescing to his advisersÛª suggestions that he reveal more about his upbringing and personal history Sanders has returned to his comfort zone: delivering lengthy campaign speeches chockablock with the same policy prescriptions he campaigned on during the 2016 campaign. In Davenport Iowa on Friday night Sanders spent 63 minutes outlining his views on health care criminal justice reform and economic inequality.ÛÏWith your help we are going to complete what we started hereÛ Sanders told the 1200-person crowd referring to his virtual tie with Clinton in the 2016 Iowa caucuses.SandersÛª approach underscores his belief that his success in 2016 was not a fluke or simply a function of being the next best alternative to Clinton. His advisers argue the populist economic message Sanders has espoused for years often in obscurity has now been embraced not only by a slew of his Democratic rivals but also Trump.ÛÏDonald Trump campaigned on economic terms as faux Bernie Sanders. It was taking his language and selling it to the American peopleÛ said Faiz Shakir SandersÛª campaign manager. ÛÏAnd now how do you defeat faux Bernie Sanders? You defeat him with real Bernie Sanders.ÛSanders owes some of his fast start to the fact that he never really stopped running for president after the 2016 campaign. Our Revolution the political group Sanders launched after the campaign has collected information on voters and held events in early voting states since the last election. Sanders was also active in the 2018 midterms throwing his support behind progressive Democratic candidates across the country though many were defeated.ÛÏHe spent 2018 lifting up progressives all over the countryÛ said Rebecca Katz a progressive Democratic consultant. ÛÏEven though many of them did not win it was appreciated it was movement building and it was a different calculation than most politicians make.ÛDespite his strong launch SandersÛª current standing atop the Democratic field is not entirely enviable. Presidential primaries are long and turbulent and past elections underscore how many early front-runners have been tossed aside before the first votes are cast. Former Vice President Joe Biden has signaled his expected presidential campaign would serve as a centrist check on SandersÛª brand of progressive politics.And though SandersÛª $18 million first-quarter fundraising haul far outpaced the rest of the Democratic field some rival campaigns breathed a sigh of relief having anticipated the Vermont senator would clear $20 million or more.ÛÏHe did very well. He could have done betterÛ said Mo Elleithee who advised Hillary ClintonÛªs 2008 presidential campaign and now runs the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service.Sanders also still has to prove that he can overcome some of the same vulnerabilities that contributed to his defeat in 2016.Chief among them will be bolstering his standing with black voters one of the most important constituencies in Democratic politics. Black voters overwhelmingly sided with Clinton in 2016 halting SandersÛª momentum when the contest moved into more diverse states. He lost the South Carolina primary by a staggering 48 points.Some of SandersÛª top advisers dismiss the notion that heÛªll face similar problems in 2020 noting that he has spent time building relationships with black leaders in South Carolina and other Southern states. HeÛªs also sharpened his campaign message on criminal justice issues and racial inequality.ÛÏI understand that a lot of people took a lot of things out of the South Carolina resultsÛ Shakir said. ÛÏWe are going to continue to court and address these issues directly but we are operating with a great deal of confidence that this is going to be a particular demographic that supports Bernie Sanders at the end of the day.ÛPerhaps SandersÛª biggest challenge is overcoming skepticism among voters who may be partial to his focus on economic inequality but fear that nominating a 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist would put Democrats in a weak position against Trump in the general election.ÛÏThatÛªs a thing that scares me about himÛ said Gwen Hobson a 70-year-old Democratic voter who attended SandersÛª rally on Friday in Davenport.Yet some of SandersÛª longtime supporters say their enthusiasm for him is unshakable. In Davenport on Friday several voters donned faded t-shirts from SandersÛª 2016 campaign. Melita Tunnicliff 57 wore a button she bought during that campaign with SandersÛª photo and the phrase ÛÏNot For Sale.ÛAsked if she was open to other Democratic candidates this time around Tunnicliff shook her head no.ÛÏIÛªve been waiting for BernieÛ she said.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

Donald Trump intends to nominate Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board according to people familiar with the matter.-- President Donald Trump said Thursday he is recommending Herman Cain a political ally and former presidential candidate for a seat on the Federal Reserve board.ÛÏIÛªve told my folks thatÛªs the manÛ Trump told reporters in the Oval Office saying that Cain is currently going through background checks prior to a formal nomination.ÛÏHeÛªs a very terrific man a terrific person. HeÛªs a friend of mineÛ Trump said. ÛÏI have recommended him highly for the Fed.ÛThe choice of Cain would mark the second Trump nomination that would elevate a conservative Trump ally to the FedÛªs main policy-making body a panel that the president has been highly critical of in recent months.The president last week said he plans to nominate Stephen Moore for a separate vacancy on the board. MooreÛªs nomination has encountered criticism that he is unqualified and too politically focused for a Fed board seat.Cain a former CEO of GodfatherÛªs Pizza ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination but dropped out after allegations of sexual harassment and infidelity.The nominations of both Cain and Moore would require Senate confirmation. Sen. John Thune the GOP Whip said lawmakers would have questions for both men.ÛÏThey all have to go through the process and see whether or not theyÛªre a good fit ÛÒ both in terms of qualifications and just the experience and everything elseÛ Thune said. ÛÏYou want somebody on the Fed to be somebody whoÛªs very knowledgeable on economic issues.ÛThe seven-member Fed board along with presidents of the FedÛªs regional banks plays a critical role in the U.S. economy holding regular meetings to debate and vote on interest rates that affect everything from savings accounts to mortgages.After Trump announced his intention to nominate Moore to the Fed board there have been published reports stating that Moore had a lien of more than $75000 filed against him in January 2018 for unpaid taxes and he has fallen behind on alimony and child support payments to his ex-wife.However Larry Kudlow head of the presidentÛªs National Economic Council told reporters Wednesday that Trump is ÛÏfully behindÛ MooreÛªs nomination. Moore served as a campaign adviser to Trump in 2016 helping to formulate TrumpÛªs tax cut plan.Moore has been highly critical of the Federal Reserve saying in December that Chairman Jerome Powell should be fired for backing a fourth Fed interest rate hike that month. Moore now says that comment was written ÛÏin a time of anger.ÛCain met with Trump in January to discuss a possible nomination to the Fed board but at the time the White House said that Trump was looking at multiple candidates for the two Fed openings.Cain who served for a number of years on the board of directors of the FedÛªs Kansas City regional bank has also been critical of the central bankÛªs policies.In a 2012 Wall Street Journal column Cain said that the FedÛªs policies manipulated the value of the dollar. In the article he advocated a return to the gold standard as a way to control inflation a position taken by other Fed critics but which many economists call unworkable.Cain in September co-founded a pro-Trump super political action committee America Fighting Back PAC. It features a photo of the president on its website and says: ÛÏWe must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.ÛCain dropped out of the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination after allegations that he had engaged in sexual harassment when he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. An Atlanta woman also said she had conducted an extramarital affair with Cain for more than 13 years.Cain called the allegations false but said he had ÛÏmade mistakes in my life.Û Before leaving the race Cain had put forward a ÛÏ9-9-9Û tax plan that called for replacing the current tax system with a flat 9 percent business and individual income tax and a 9 percent sales tax.Trump has been highly critical Powell the person he picked to be Fed chairman after deciding that he would not renominate Janet Yellen. In addition to selecting Powell for the top job Trump has nominated all the current Fed board members with the exception of Lael Brainard who was nominated by Barack Obama.TrumpÛªs other nominees have held views more in line with traditional selections for the Fed board. The White House announced Thursday that Trump was nominating Michelle Bowman a Kansas banking regulator for a full 14-year term on the Fed. She joined the Fed last year taking over a term that will end next year.Trump however has grown increasingly unhappy with Fed decisions under PowellÛªs direction especially after the stock market took a nosedive last year as the central bank was hiking rates four times. Since January the Fed has reversed course and now says it expects no further rates hikes this year.Even with that change Trump has continued to be critical. Kudlow last week called for the Fed not only to pause rate hikes but to actually cut rates by one-half percentage point saying he and the president believed that was the best course of action.In a tweet Thursday Trump said the economy was looking very strong ÛÏdespite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed.ÛRead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/04/source-trump-selects-herman-cain-fed-board/39298947/,0

Why This Israeli Election Is Different | RealClearWorlWhy This Israeli Election Is DifferenWhy This Israeli Election Is DifferenWhy This Israeli Election Is DifferenVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Tomorrow Israelis will elect the 2Knesset or parliament in IsraelÛªs 70-year history. Politics are always tricky and more so now. WhatÛªs real and whatÛªs fake news? What does each candidate say and what do they actually intend to do?In IsraelÛªs representative parliamentary system things can be even harder to understand. There are manyåÊparties. They rise and fall each year alongside the legacy parties and there is a 3.25 percent threshold for admittance to the Knesset. The left-right paradigm breaks down differently in Israel than it does in the United States or Europe and within the Israeli context that paradigm is undergoing a fundamental realignment.This yearÛªs elections are vitally important. The outcome could have a major impact on IsraelÛªs future its role in the region and its relationship with the United States and American Jews.IsraelÛªs Knesset consists of 120 seats. Votes are for a pre-determined party list meaning Israelis vote for a party and its candidate for prime minister with the same ballot. Two main parties are battling for the premiership and the right to form the governing coalition. The first is the ruling Likud party headed by Benjamin ÛÏBibiÛ Netanyahu who seeks his fourth term as prime minister. Former Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff and political rookie Benny Gantz is NetanyahuÛªs main competitor. Gantz leads the Blue and White Party alongside former Finance Minister Yair Lapid and another pair of former IDF chiefs Moshe YaÛªalon and Gabi Ashkenazi. Netanyahu stands to the right of center while Gantz and Lapid bill themselves as the new ÛÏcenterÛ a term that changes meaning from election to election. Each side expects to win some 30 seats.To the left we have the heir to IsraelÛªs founding party the left-of-center Avodah or Labor. Further left sits IsraelÛªs progressive party Meretz. Together they are expected to land around 15 seats. IsraelÛªs Arab minority (20 percent of the country) is represented in the main by two parties: Hadash/TaÛªal is more moderate and seeks to integrate into Israeli society and RaÛªam/ Balad is the more Palestinian-nationalist and Islamist party. This latter might not pass the 3.25 percent entry threshold a ratio that translates to 4 seats out of 120.Floating alongside the Likud in the right-of-center space are two small parties: Kulanu headed by current Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and Gesher headed by Orli Levi-Abekasis. Both lean right on security matters but have preferred to focus on economic and social matters. Both teeter on the verge of the electoral threshold.To LikudÛªs right are a handful of small parties some new and some more familiar. Education Minister Naftali Bennett and Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked broke away from the religious-Zionist Jewish Home party a few months back in order to form New Right an alternative party that is younger further to the right and not beholden to religious interests. They are expected to barely pass the electoral threshold. What remained of Jewish Home merged with two religious-Zionist parties each more right-wing on security and religious matters to ensure they all pass the electoral threshold. This is called the Union of the Right Wing Parties and includes the Jewish Power party whose head was banned from office by the election committee for blatant racism. Together they are expected to pass the threshold. Former Defense Minister Avigdor LiebermanÛªs Yisrael Beiteinu (ÛÏIsrael is Our HomeÛ) party offers a right-wing approach on security matters with a strong secular appeal and it draws mainly on older Russian immigrant voters. Russians have integrated more and more into Israeli society and Lieberman will struggle to pass the threshold.There are two main ultra-Orthodox parties: United Torah Judaism represents the Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox and Shas represents the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox. Both parties have committed voter bases all but ensuring them tickets into the Knesset.The last party is the surprise of these elections: Moshe FeiglinÛªs Zehut (ÛÏIdentityÛ) party has shot up the polls based on an original but not fully understood platform that combines Jewish fundamentalism far-right nationalism and economic and social libertarianism. A sideshow just two months ago Feiglin who is accompanied by a maverick ultra-Orthodox rabbi and an anti-vaxxer could be the kingmaker in these elections.Did I forget anyone? I hope not.The publishing of polling data is forbidden in the days ahead of the elections but the last polls gave a fair sense of where most parties stand. Barring an election day surprise the two frontrunners will each take around 30 seats. The right-wing parties however are expected to win more than their left-wing counterparts. Right-wing parties most of whom would sit in a Knesset with Netanyahu as prime minister are expected to win around 65 seats. The parties that would refuse to sit with Netanyahu are expected to win no more than 55 seats. Considering this includes the Arab parties who are not expected to actively partake in any governing coalition this puts Blue and White considerably behind Netanyahu.The president chooses the party he believes has the best chance of forming at least a 61-seat coalition as the ruling party -- and its head as the putative prime minister. This is usually the largest party but not always. GantzÛªs Blue and White could win more votes than Likud but lack the backing needed to assemble a coalition. If this is the case Netanyahu will head the next government.However if Gantz wins by a large enough margin -- say 5 seats -- the president would be less likely to offer Netanyahu the first crack at putting together a coalition. Moreover if a number of the smaller parties fall short of the threshold a likely scenario the redistribution of their votes among the parties that did pass could change the entire equation.Therefore Israelis could conceivably wake up Wednesday morning to some unexpected outcomes. Best to wait and see.One possibility to keep in mind is that if Netanyahu is forced to step down due to anticipated indictments we could see a reshuffling of the expected right-wing coalition into a unity government headed by Likud and Blue and White in some sort of rotational power-sharing government.Left right center? Depends what Issue we are discussinNotions like left and right usually connote a partyÛªs position on security social and economic matters. In Israel we could say the left has traditionally promoted a combination of more government regulation socialist-leaning economic policies secular or liberal attitudes on social-religious matters and actively seeking to end the conflict with the Palestinians and the control over them. Traditionally the right has stood for the exact opposite set of policies with some exceptions among the ultra-Orthodox who never fit these labels.The past two decades have seen a scrambling of these definitions and groupings. Although you still have a left and a right by self-definition you have a significant group of Israelis -- one-third if not more -- who eschew such definitions and place themselves in the less-definable center. Although taking heat from the ideological left and right as being indecisive or simply confused about themselves the new center simply doesnÛªt fit into existing paradigms.For example we can talk about a right and left as concerns security and the matter of a potential Palestinian state. The left seeks to end the occupation of the West Bank or Judea and Samaria (depending on your political views). It believes Israel can reach a diplomatic agreement with the Palestinian Authority and wants to dismantle outlying settlements (outside of the major blocs which have near-consensus support in Israel). The center would support all of that in theory but doesnÛªt believe there is a negotiating partner capable of upholding such a deal on the other side. Centrists talk about stopping or even dismantling outlying settlements but retaining military control to preserve the possibility of a future demilitarized Palestinian state. ItÛªs important to recall that the centrist Blue and White party just happens to be led by three former IDF Chiefs in part to neutralize the rightÛªs claim that it is the only side that can ensure IsraelÛªs security in a country that can literally go to war at any given time.The right has a range of opinions on this issue. The range starts from essentially what the center believes but with more skepticism; to allowing a sub-state entity with local autonomy; to encouraging migration (with economic incentives); to full annexation and offering either limited-rights residency or even full citizenship to those who swear loyalty to Israel (as a Jewish state of course). These positions shouldnÛªt be able to exist in the same coalition but they do share one major characteristic: They believe there is absolutely nobody to trust on the other side. They also share the notion that the Palestinians missed their opportunity and will have to settle with less than what was previously offered them. As to Gaza suffice it to say that no mainstream party really knows what to do with the intransigent Hamas and the growing humanitarian disaster in the coastal strip. So far aside from ÛÏweÛªll handle it betterÛ nobody is really offering an alternative.Beyond security ÛÏrightÛ and ÛÏleftÛ donÛªt translate to economic matters or questions of religion and state. This is partly why the ÛÏcenterÛ has come into play as a new construct. Meretz and Avodah certainly represent the classic left. But while Blue and White is centrist on security matters it espouses free-market capitalism on economic issues alongside greater separation of religion and state. Yisrael Beiteinu is ÛÏrightÛ on security matters but ÛÏleftÛ on religion and state. BennettÛªs New Right is ÛÏrightÛ on security ÛÏrightÛ on free-market capitalism but ÛÏcenterÛ on religion and state matters. Kulanu and Gesher are ÛÏcenterÛ or ÛÏrightÛ on security matters but support a wider economic and social safety net along traditionally leftist lines. Zehut totally shuffles the cards by offering hard-right security policies alongside a total separation of religion and state.What are these elections really about?Beyond labels there seem to be two main issues at play in these elections -- issues that have been dividing Israeli society for at least four years. The first issue is Netanyahu himself. The prime minister faces indictment in three different corruption and breach of public trust cases in the coming year. These investigations have been ongoing throughout his entire previous term. The public is essentially split on Netanyahu. Clearly a talented and experienced politician Netanyahu has led a campaign to sow public mistrust of the press (all biased leftists) the judicial system (activists leftists) and even the police (out to get him). That the attorney general and former police chief were his own appointments is of little consequence. By bypassing the mainstream press and making deft use of social media Netanyahu has managed to galvanize half of the public behind him against these institutions. Public trust in the press judiciary and police has never been lower. Recall that elections were originally scheduled for November. Netanyahu pushed for early elections seeking to upend the timing of potential indictments and bring public counter-pressure to the impending hearings.Moreover it is no longer clear where Netanyahu stops and the party and government begin. Most of the Likud campaign ads are personally focused on Netanyahu and it is no accident that he is also defense minister as well as foreign affairs and health minister. Is Netanyahu channeling his inner Louis XIV (ÛÏÛ)? Does he believe thatis the state? It's not clear to voters or to the Likud party itself that he can tell the difference anymore. In many ways this election is therefore a referendum on Netanyahu. Indeed there are few practical policy differences between Likud and Blue and White. Netanyahu is the difference.This is no small matter. Many Blue and White voters who might otherwise vote Likud feel that Netanyahu in an attempt to shield himself from his legal woes might trade important political favors to the more extreme religious or nationalist right that could cause deep and long-term changes to the nation's character. Netanyahu supporters on the other hand draw on his real foreign-policy achievements and his personal relations with many world leaders. With Israel surrounded by threats they argue that now is not the time to put political novices at the helm. The allegations of corruption are either overstated or conspiratorial they add and entirely forgivable given the experience and stability Netanyahu brings to the office.But there is a larger issue at stake one that perhaps is drawing the new division between IsraelÛªs left and right: What does it means to be a representative democracy? Does being a democracy mean that the government should reflect the will of the majority of voters or does being a democracy mean safeguarding freedom of press an independent judiciary rule of law and respect for individual and minority rights? The current forces of the new right including the aptly named New Right party and rising stars within the Likud are pushing for major reforms to rein in the judicial activism of the Supreme Court and a greater democratic say in appointing its justices as well as lower-court judges. They also want to give the Knesset the ability to overturn the CourtÛªs decisions with a special majority. Taken together with the unprecedented attacks on the press and the integrity of the police we can see a clear and new fault-line. The more liberal old guard of the Likud most of which has been slowly pushed out of the party by the more populist new guard is uncomfortable with this development. Indeed one of its most prominent members endorsed the Blue and White party last week.If the outcome is as predicted by most political observers the next government will look a lot like the current one only with more confidence and a stronger hard-right contingent on security and matters of religion and state.As for the region many are anxiously awaiting the Trump administrationÛªs peace plan expected to be presented following the elections. Parties to the right of Likud have already proclaimed their rejection of any such agreement. Netanyahu seeking to take away last-second votes from his right-wing adversaries stated in a series of rare radio and television interviews that he would seek annexation of (parts of?) the West Bank something he has hesitated to say before. Is this an election-week jump to the right? Or has he abandoned any pretense to supporting a two-state solution? Is he preparing skeptical right-wing voters for political compromise with the Palestinians? Or is he emboldened by recent diplomatic victories such as on the Golan Heights and going for broke? It's hard to know at this point. Keep in mind that it was right-winger Menachem Begin who made peace with Egypt and returned the Sinai Peninsula despite strong opposition on the right and Ariel Sharon who withdrew from Gaza against similar opposition.Whatever happens on the Palestinian issue will surely affect IsraelÛªs regional standing. Israel has taken its once-secret relations with the Sunni Arab world to new levels in recent years. It has been able to do so thanks to Arab fears of a resurgent Iran a regional sense of abandonment by the United States and growing apathy toward the Palestinian cause. But part of that relies at least on the illusion that Israel seeks peace with the Palestinians. Should Israel discard even this illusion the Arabs would be hard-pressed to continue this positive regional trend without risking their own internal political stability.The same holds true for IsraelÛªs relationship with the United States and American Jews. Israel has become more and more of a partisan issue in American politics. There are a number of reasons for this fromåÊdomestic political and social trends in the United States to the lack of progress on the Palestinian issue and Netanyahu's openly challenging President Obama to Israel's domestic shift to the right in recent decades. With roughly 70 percent of American Jews being loyal Democrats Israel risks cementing its perceived abandonment of half of America and most of American Jews in order to curry favor with the other half -- a risky strategy in the long run.Given the likelihood that a right-wing government will continue to take hardline stances on matters of religion and state Israel risks further alienating most American Jews who have been able to overlook to some extent the diplomatic stalemate with the Palestinians. Furthermore Israel could find itself continuing along the path of deepening relations with the Trumps Putins Bolsonaros Modis and Orbans of the world at the expense of more moderate leaders. If the Democrats retake the White House IsraelÛªs standing in Washington will surely be affected and American Jews will be more hesitant to come to its rescue as they have done in the past.Right left center whatever -- the outcome of these elections will have more significance than most realize. How this plays out we will find out in the coming weeks.

While you were sleeping Congress was shutting down the government ÛÓ and then reopening it ÛÓ in a familiar display of dysfunction. It's the second time this year lawmakers have let funding lapse while they staged standoffs intended to draw attention to their causes.The first was a result of' strategy on immigration. But Friday's episode was less about strategy and more about aimless drift. After little action Thursday a single senator dug in forcing the Senate to stall and miss the midnight deadline. Like kids scrambling to clean up before Mom and Dad get home lawmakers then had to rush to turn the lights back on before federal employees were due to report to work.A recap of the action overnight and early Friday:HOW DID WE GET HERE?The government has been operating on funding from a series of short-term spending measures. Three weeks ago Senate Democrats dug in and decided to use a deadline to try to forceto work with them on a deal for ""Dreamer"" immigrants whose protections from deportation are due to expire in March. No deal came together and the government shut down over the weekend. Ultimately Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. agreed to hold votes on an unspecified immigration bill in return for Democrats' votes to reopen the government for three more weeks.DIDN'T THEY HAVE A DEAL?Yes. Senate leaders used the three weeks to hash out a two-year $400 billion budget agreement. McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer announced it Wednesday lauding it as a major breakthrough. The deal found support in both parties largely because it has something for everyone ÛÓ both the military spending Republicans wanted and the money for domestic programs Democrats sought. It also includes $89 billion for disaster relief sought by both parties.The bill does nothing on immigration. That's the problem for Democrats especially in the House where no vote has been promised on Dreamers who have lived in the country illegally since they were children. For some Republicans the problem was spending specifically too much of it. The budget will put the U.S. on track to reach a $1 trillion deficit. For some fiscal conservatives who just spent years opposing President Barack Obama's deficits that's tough to swallow. Still leaders expected they could thread the needle to find the votes to pass the bill in both the House and Senate.WHERE DID THIS GO WRONG?From the beginning. The Senate had to move fast to pass the deal. But Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. a fiscal conservative and resident contrarian pumped the brakes using his objection allowed under Senate rules to delay a vote until after 1 a.m. Friday. By the time the Senate passed the deal just before 2 a.m. the government had been officially shuttered for nearly two hours. The House rushed to approve its version wrapping up the vote just after 5:30 a.m. President Donald Trump signed the bill three hours later reopening the government.The brief shutdown likely won't register for most people. Congress and the president acted in time to allow federal employees to get to work on Friday keeping disruptions to a minimum. The budget deal approved by Congress matters a lot to the Pentagon and for domestic programs for opioids health centers and research funding. The budget agreement will set spending for programs for the next two years ÛÓ if they stick to it. Under the short-term agreement approved early Friday the government is funded for another six weeks to give lawmakers time to craft a budget plan. If they don't have something long-term in place by then the country could be in shutdown mode again in March.Associated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this story.Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

IÛªll do one or the other and probably settle for the tariffsÛ Trump said at the White House.It was a dramatic departure for Trump who last week tweeted that he would close the border or large swaths of it this week unless Mexico immediately halted ÛÏALL illegal immigration coming into the United States.ÛTrump said at the time that he was ÛÏnot kidding aroundÛ and his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in a television interview Sunday that it would take ÛÏsomething dramaticÛ for Trump not to close down the crossings.Since then however White House advisers American leaders in border cities and U.S. economists have warned that such a move would have enormous economic consequences on both sides of the border interrupting supply chains and boosting U.S. consumer prices on everything from avocadoes to autos.The U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which had said closing the border would be ÛÏan unmitigated economic debacleÛ that would threaten 5 million American jobs.In recent days Trump has appeared to put his threat on hold praising the Mexican government for doing more to apprehend migrants traveling through the country from Central America.On Thursday Trump also threatened tariffs if Mexico doesnÛªt halt the flow of illegal drugs across the border saying heÛªd give the country ÛÏa one year warningÛ to comply.ÛÏWe will put tariffs on if they donÛªt apprehend and ultimately weÛªre going to give a period time. But if in a year from now drugs continue to pour in weÛªre going to put tariffs onÛ he said adding: ÛÏI donÛªt play games.ÛSeparately on Thursday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats would file a lawsuit aimed at preventing Trump from ÛÏstealingÛ billions from federal programs and diverting the money to building barriers along the border.Trump declared a national emergency so he could use more money to construct the wall heÛªs promised since his presidential campaign. Congress voted to block the emergency declaration but Trump vetoed that measure.Trump has been increasingly exasperated by the swelling numbers of migrants entering the U.S. including thousands who have being released after arriving because border officials have no space for them. Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed in recent months and border agents were on track to make 100000 arrests or denials of entry in March a 12-year high. More than half of those are families with children who require extra care.With southern border facilities near a breaking point U.S. officials are busing many migrants hundreds of miles inland and dropping them off at bus stations and churches. Trump has mocked and vowed to end that ÛÏcatch and releaseÛ practice but overwhelmed authorities see no choice.Administration officials have been studying ways to minimize the economic impact of a potential closure in case Trump went through with his threat including keeping trucking lanes open or closing only certain ports.But even absent that threatened extraordinary step delays at border stations have been mounting after some 2000 border officers were reassigned from checking vehicles to deal with migrant crowds.Associated Press writer Darlene Superville contributed to this report.Read or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2019/04/04/trump-threatens-tariffs-mexican-cars-border-fight/39299281/,0
"A Time for Constitutional Boldness | RealClearPoliticA Time for Constitutional BoldnesA Time for Constitutional BoldnesA Time for Constitutional BoldnesVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...WASHINGTON -- As a country we have become Constitutionally lazy. And timid.Note the capitalization of ""Constitutionally.""At various points in our history we have been willing to reexamine flawed or out of date provisions in our founding document. Six constitutional amendments -- guaranteeing the right to vote for African Americans having voters rather than state legislatures elect our senators abolishing the poll tax giving the District of Columbia a say in the Electoral College and extending the right to vote to women and younger Americans -- made our republic more democratic.The 26th Amendment approved in 1971 to let 18-year-olds vote was the last to get through in a conventional way. The fluky 27th Amendment ratified in 1992 had been sent to the states in 1789. It bars a sitting Congress from raising its own pay and was only approved after Gregory Watson a sophomore at the University of Texas discovered in the 1980s that it was still out there.That our last amendment was something close to an accident underscores how unwilling we are to confront the need for systematic change. That's why I cheered this week when Sen. Brian Schatz D-Hawaii joined a group of colleagues to propose an amendment providing for the election of our president by popular vote not the Electoral College. Sen. Jeff Merkley D-Ore. offered a comparable proposal last month. So far at least seven Democratic presidential candidates have endorsed the idea.Schatz is under no illusions that his proposed amendment will even get out of Congress anytime soon. But ""the basic principle that the person who gets the most votes should be president of the United States"" is worth fighting for he said in an interview. There's value in staking out ""clear principled and popular positions"" and pursuing them with ""persistence and patience.""The view that the Electoral College is outdated and a time bomb for our democracy was once widely held across party lines. As Geoffrey Skelley noted in FiveThirtyEight a May 1968 Gallup poll found that 66 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of Democrats approved of switching to the popular vote. Now the Electoral College offers Republicans a built-in advantage giving the issue a partisan edge. That's unfortunate because faith in the fairness and representativeness of our system will continue to erode if we make it a habit of allowing popular-vote losers to ascend to the Oval Office.Another sign that structural change is back on the public agenda: There are a variety of proposals to change the way Supreme Court justices are selected. This is a response to how partisan both the confirmation process and the court itself have become.Pete Buttigieg the South Bend Indiana mayor and presidential hopeful has floated an intriguing way to push back against politicized jurisprudence. Membership on the court would be increased from nine to 15 members. Republican and Democratic presidents would name five each. Those ten would in turn select the remaining members from the appellate bench by unanimous vote.At the least his far-reaching restructuring might encourage openness to more modest reforms such as 18-year term limits on justices. When the Constitution was adopted life expectancy stood at around 35. Now it's 79. Lifetime appointment means something very different today than it did in 1787.Garrett Epps a law professor at the University of Baltimore noted in an email that constitutional amendments usually ""come in clusters and they tend to come at moments of national optimism and feeling of confidence."" (Too bad for us right now.) The three Civil War amendments -- abolishing slavery guaranteeing equal protection and the right to vote -- are good examples as are the Progressive Era amendments on women's suffrage allowing an income tax and directly electing senators.Epps argues that Electoral College reform is what's most urgently needed. He points to the fact we have altered ""the system of presidential election and succession no fewer than four times"" (through the 12th 20th 22nd and 25th Amendments) a reflection of our ongoing difficulties in getting it right.The best way to honor our past is not to freeze its practices in place but to remember that our forebears were willing to undertake reform when reforms were required.""When Americans have confronted major political economic and social crises throughout our history we have debated -- and adopted -- constitutional changes to address them"" said Ganesh Sitaraman a law professor at Vanderbilt University. ""Many of the recent proposals for constitutional reforms are in line with this tradition.""Yes and we shouldn't be afraid of them.(c) 2019 Washington Post Writers GrouLog In with your RCMG Accoun",0

Millions of Americans are fed up with intellectually dishonest politicians were not looking up for them.But for every action there is a reaction. And the law of unintended consequences is now hitting President Trump. And thatÛªs because the swamp is inhabited by many different creatures ÛÓ some of whom want to destroy the president.Right now the national media despises Mr. Trump as we have pointed out and backed up with facts.Also some folks working for the federal government want to damage the president. Ì¢åÛåÒ ThatÌ¢åÛåªs why you are seeing the leaks from intelligence agencies and other federal bureaucracies.Now all presidents have to deal with leaks. But in this political climate the press gleefullyaccepts information from anonymous sources and spins it negative against Trump.As we pointed out on Wednesday night the public and press donÛªt know what General Michael Flynn said to the Russian ambassador. We will know. But we donÛªt now.Also whether there is any truth to allegations that people working on the Trump campaign had meaningful contact with the Russia government. We donÛªt know.HereÌ¢åÛåªs what civil rights activist Al Sharpton said on February 15 on the Tom Joyner radio show:Ì¢åÛåÏIf there was dialogue and negotiations with the Russians with the Russians which is clearly against the law and clearly an act that cannot be pardoned. If the president knew while it was going on and it did not stop it or in some way authorized it that can be impeachable.Ì¢åÛåItÌ¢åÛåªs not against the law for anyone to talk with any Russian. General Flynn had no power other than being a private citizen when the call with the Russian ambassador to took place. In order for him to have committed a crime he would have had to attempt to formally attempt to undermine the Obama administrationÌ¢åÛåªs Russian policy. So Sharpton is full of it as always.Also as we said Wednesday night if thereÌ¢åÛåªs truth to those allegations they should be taken very seriously when the facts are presented.When President Trump first mentioned draining the swamp in Washington I donÛªt believe he understood how extensive the problem really is. After eight years of President Obama there are many people working in the federal government who like the former president and who despise Mr. Trump.So the Trump administration has its hands full.Since 2011 Editorial Journalist Blogger Author of 20 Books Tech Writer Computer Programmer Website Developer and now Columnist For USA Politics Today!Trump Slams Û÷Out Of ControlÛª MediTrump Waging War On Leaks And DisinformatioTrump Backing Away From Palestinian Stat' + arr_splits[i] + '"" + formated_str + """,0

The otherÛªs a boyish 46-year-old native of the U.S.-Mexico border city of El Paso Texas who livestreams his skateboarding prowess and offers hopeful but vague paeans to tolerance and cooperation.Bernie SandersåÊandåÊBeto OÛªRourkeåÊmay represent different poles among the dozen-plus Democrats vying for the White House but they have key commonalities that now inject special tension into their rivalry as they ramp up their campaigns.Both lead the pack in fundraising and haveåÊbuilt substantial campaign treasuries on thousands of small donorsåÊnationwide rather than using the more traditional model of a small core of major financial backers.They also strike chords with the same part of the electorate. In their last races each rose on a strong appeal to young voters.Now though itÛªs not clear both can exploit their strengths while going head-to-head.Already they find themselves recruiting some of the same campaign talent with a few veterans of SandersÛª 2016 presidential bid having signed on this time with OÛªRourke.While other candidates in the 2020 race have natural connections to other parts of the Democratic voting base Sanders a U.S. senator and OÛªRourke a former congressman could find themselves in more of a zero-sum contest for the same turf. Both will be in Iowa this weekend campaigning for the upper hand.ÛÏIf Bernie begins to surge the Beto people will largely go there. The oppositeÛªs true tooÛ said Jim Hightower a former Texas agriculture commissioner who was a top state Sanders supporter in 2016 but also among the first to counsel OÛªRourke on his near-upset in November of Sen. Ted Cruz.This week Sanders announced that he raised $18.2 million in 41 days of campaigning through March 31. OÛªRourke countered that heÛªd collected $9.4 million in an 18-day period or $520000-plus daily.Matt Bennett co-founder of the Third Way a centrist Washington think tank said Sanders finds himself more hemmed in than when he ran a surprisingly tight race in 2016 against Hillary Clinton.ÛÏHe has plenty of competition in the authenticity category nowÛ including from Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Indiana who also have attracted strong online fundraising.Still Bennett said OÛªRourke may prove the stiffest test to Sanders given that his donor base is so similar ÛÓ a key metric for campaign strength so early in the electoral cycle.ÛÏWhat youÛªre going to see is there is not a clean ideological explanation for where people end upÛ Bennett said. ÛÏItÛªs going to be who speaks to me who inspires me with their rhetoric with their persona with their passion.ÛOther major candidates in the Democratic presidential field ÛÓ which includes two African Americans a half dozen women a Latino and a gay candidate ÛÓ have obvious inroads with key ethnic racial and demographic groups that lean Democratic.But Sanders and OÛªRourke have shown they can consistently draw throngs of young voters to their rallies.SandersÛª crusty passion ÛÓ and willingness to fight for policy ideas that seemed far-fetched even if it wreaked havoc on both parties ÛÓ appealed to 2016 voters who were sometimes less than a third his age.OÛªRourke who was still in high school when Sanders entered Congress in 1991 has whipped up enthusiasm by preaching optimistic bipartisanship to meet challenges like climate change.TexasÛª 2018 midterms ÛÓ which included OÛªRourkeÛªs Senate race ÛÓ drew nearly 1.1 million voters between ages 18 and 29 or 235% more than the stateÛªs midterms in 2014 in no small part due to his campaign.As the nationÛªs population gets older young voters are seen as increasingly important to Democratic candidates.ÛÏThe Democratic PartyÛªs age profile is really defying the aging pattern of the country overallÛ said Alec Tyson of the Pew Research Center which specializes in election analysis. ÛÏTheyÛªre about as young as they were 10 years ago which is remarkable because the countryÛªs not.ÛPew data indicates that millennial voters born between 1981 and 1996 have had a Democratic tilt since reaching adulthood.In the early weeks of his campaign OÛªRourke has prioritized visiting colleges. HeÛªs impressed some previous Sanders supporters with the 30-year gap between them.ÛÏI think itÛªs really important to get people excited and I think thatÛªs what Beto does and IÛªm not sure Bernie does anymoreÛ said Meaghan OÛªConnor 21 a Sanders voter in 2016 who attended an OÛªRourke campus rally at Penn State University last month.Both Sanders and OÛªRourke have worked to reach other demographic groups. Sanders has recalled his days as a civil rights activist at the University of Chicago and OÛªRourke has made three visits since 2017 to historically black Texas Southern University in Houston.Despite having overlapping strengths OÛªRourke and Sanders are different politically.OÛªRourke is more establishment-minded promising to work with Republicans and appeal to past Donald Trump supporters. His message that relies more on optimism than specifics reminds some of Barack ObamaÛªs 2008 pitch.Sanders specializes in specificity best illustrated by his ÛÏMedicare for AllÛ health care plan calls for $15 hourly minimum wage and proposals to shrink large investment banks.ÛÏBlindly following Beto for his personality is a bad thingÛ said Travis Clark a 23-year-old University of Texas student who saw OÛªRourke at a recent Austin rally but remains undecided. ÛÏYou have to vote for the candidate for the right reasons not just because you like them.ÛLog In with your RCMG Accoun,0

We Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start Agreeing | RealClearPoliticWe Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start AgreeinWe Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start AgreeinWe Should Worry When Zuckerberg Dems Start AgreeinVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...over Facebook CEO Mark ZuckerbergÛªsfor ÛÏnew rulesÛ to regulate internet companies like his ÛÓ and that should worry every freedom-loving American.DonÛªt be fooled. This is not some humbled executive begrudgingly accepting that his industry needs regulation. This is one of the richest men on earth inviting the American government to help him do what he already wants to do anyway.LetÛªs be perfectly clear: Every single regulatory measure Zuckerberg is calling for would benefit his company his political and himself personally. At best regulation would just deflect from the unsavory practices of Facebook and its competitors; at worst it would enlist government sponsorship for those practices.Democratic Sen. Mark Warner greeted ZuckerbergÛªs announcement byhe was ÛÏglad to seeÛ that ÛÏthe era of the social media Wild West is over.ÛOf course when Warner refers to the ÛÏsocial media Wild WestÛ heÛªs not talking about tech giants routinelymemes that lampoon their journalist friends andRepublican candidates during election campaigns.No Warner means the Wild West of relatively unbridled free speech that allowed millions of Americans to crack the consensus forged by the political establishment of both parties in 2016.When he says ÛÏthe Wild West is overÛ Warner means just what GoogleÛªs CFOwhen he promised to ÛÏuse the great strength and resources and reach we have to continue to advance really important valuesÛ just days after President TrumpÛªs victory over Hillary Clinton.Those on the left are determined to prevent a repeat of the 2016 presidential election which is why they are so adamantly pushing for more censorship online. ItÛªs just their luck that they have a potential ally in Zuckerberg a man who would love to throw this hands up and say ÛÏHey the government handles that.ÛIn his Washington Post op-ed Zuckerberg calls for an ÛÏindependent bodyÛ to do his censorship for him and decide what ÛÏcounts as terrorist propaganda hate speech and more.ÛZuckerberg actually has the gall to write ÛÏLawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech and frankly I agreeÛ asserting that while internet companies should be ÛÏaccountable for enforcing standards on harmful contentÛ those standards should be dictated by government officials.To be sure outspoken conservatives such as Sens.have demanded answers from Big Tech regarding its ever-tightening campaign of censorship against the political right and Silicon ValleyÛªs exploitation of its power over the main forums of modern public discourse to potentially swing elections ÛÓ but their point has been that censorship of any kind is an affront to the American people. ZuckerbergÛªs response however is to propose more censorship not less.ItÛªs all ridiculous. We donÛªt need leftist bureaucrats to tell us what we can say on the internet any more than we need leftist tech executives to police our speech. We donÛªt need an ÛÏindependent bodyÛ to protect us from ÛÏharmful contentÛ ÛÓ we already have the Supreme Court the First Amendment and 100 years of precedent to guide our governance of public forums.These are plenty sufficient to prohibit viewpoint-based discrimination while banning illegal acts such as calls to violence and allowing private platforms like Facebook to enact reasonable time place and manner restrictions according to their taste.Sen. Hawley for instance hasthat the special privileges Facebook enjoys under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act be conditioned on it serving as a viewpoint-neutral public forum. For some reason though thatÛªs not the kind of regulation Zuckerberg is interested in.ZuckerbergÛªs other ÛÏconcessionsÛ are no less self-serving. His call for greater transparency in political advertising for instance is laughable. Zuckerberg argues that we already have sufficient regulation of ads run by candidates and parties despite the fact that Facebook infamouslyin 2018 but he asserts that we need stronger rules governing ads about ÛÏdivisive political issues where weÛªve seen more attempted interferenceÛ feeding into the DemocratsÛª absurd narrative that a few Russian Facebook ads explain Hillary ClintonÛªs defeat.In a perfect illustration of the globalist corporate mindset Zuckerberg also calls for importing privacy laws from the European Union where people are routinelyin jail for social media arguing that ÛÏeffective privacy and data protection needs a globally harmonized framework.ÛLuckily the regulators President Trump has put in place are wise to ZuckerbergÛªs game. As FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr ÛÏWhen large corporations call for greater government control it's not usually an act of charity.ÛThatÛªs exactly the sort of hard-headed realism we need to protect our fundamental rights as Facebook and other Big Tech companies ramp up their campaign of anti-conservative censorship especially now that Zuckerberg is trying to enlist liberal politicians with tremendous power as allies in that effort.Brad Parscale is the campaign manager for Donald J.

He has previously said he did not believe it would be in the public&amp;apos;s interest to release the full document in piecemeal or gradual fashion and that he did not intend for his letter summarizing Mueller&amp;apos;s ""principal conclusions"" to be an ""exhaustive recounting"" of the special counsel&amp;apos;s investigation.Barr is now expected to release the entire report with redactions by mid-April.""Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter the Attorney General decided to release the report&amp;apos;s bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately ÛÓ without attempting to summarize the report ÛÓ with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process"" the Justice Department statement said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Pompeo: No peace and stability in Middle East unless Iran's Revolutionary Guard is weakeneNunes files $150M lawsuit against McClatchy alleging conspiracy to derail Clinton Russia probeMike Gravel kicks off 'losing 2020 presidential campaignÛª with ad platform releasBernie Sanders' biggest star-studded backers: Mark Ruffalo Danny DeVito and otherThis material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed. å©2019 FOX News Network LLC.

He added that the law on releasing tax returns is ÛÏ100 percent on my side.ÛTrump has long insisted that the reason he wonÛªt voluntarily release his tax returns is because he is under audit by the IRS.

Biden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNN | RealClearPoliticBiden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNBiden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNBiden Coverage Dwarfed by Mueller Report on MSNBC CNVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Former Vice President Biden has been making headlines this week as his potential presidential campaign gears up but surely not the kind he was hoping for. Following Lucy FloresÛª claims that BidenÛªs touching of her in 2014 made her deeply uncomfortable more women have comewith similar concerns and BidenÛªs ÛÏhands onÛ style of greeting has become a political meme. Some Democratic-leaning newshave notably come to BidenÛªs but what has TV coverage of the story as a whole looked like?The timeline below shows the total percentage of weekly airtime on CNN MSNBC and Fox News combined that mentioned Biden since June 2009 using data from the Internet ArchiveÛªs. The past week has seen the second-most television news coverage of him over the past decade trailing only his 2012 reelection.Looking at the past two weeks by channel all three initially covered the Flores allegations but CNN and MSNBC quickly moved on. Fox News on the other hand has continued to devote significant attention to the story. Since Flores spoke up on March 29 Fox News has spent almost as much time on the story as the other two channels combined.The tremendous discrepancy in coverage can be seen most starkly in the graph below which tallies the total airtime devoted by each station since March 29 to the Robert Mueller and Biden stories. MSNBC has spent 3.2 times as much time on Mueller as it has Biden with CNN spending 2.3 times as much airtime. Fox News on the other hand has paid almost equal time to both stories.Even two weeks after BarrÛªs release of key conclusions of the Mueller report there has not been a single day in which the Biden story received more airtime on MSNBC than the Mueller story and Biden bested Mueller for just a single day on CNN. It seems MSNBC in particular is working to keep the Mueller storyPutting this all together it is notable that in the #MeToo era the reckoning over a powerful politicianÛªs uncomfortable interactions with women has not drawn more attention. CNN and MSNBC have largely downplayed the Biden allegations preferring to focus their time on the Mueller investigation while Fox News has granted both stories nearly equal airtime.If #MeToo allegations against one of the most prominent Democratic contenders canÛªt break through the news cycle on CNN and MSNBC and with prominent Democrat Justin Fairfax withstanding his own #MeTooin Virginia it raises the question of whether #MeTooÛªs role in the 2020 election cycle may be fading.RealClear Media Fellow Kalev Leetaru is a senior fellow at the George Washington University Center for Cyber &amp; Homeland Security.

Read the letter she submitted to President Trump below.I hereby resign from the position of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) effective April 7th 2019. It has been my great honor to lead the men and women of the Department as its sixth Secretary. I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service dedication and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. I join all Americans in thanking them for their sacrifices and those of their families.For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department. I am immensely proud of our successes in transforming DHS to keep pace with our enemies and adversaries ÛÓ whether it is in cyberspace or against emerging threats from new technologies.Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside. I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure AmericaÛªs borders and which have contributed to discord in our nationÛªs discourse. Our country - and the men and women of DHS - deserve to have all the tools and resources they need to execute the mission entrusted to them.I can say with confidence our homeland is safer today than when I joined the Administration. We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders combat illegal immigration obstruct the inflow of drugs and uphold our laws and values. We have responded decisively to record-breaking natural disasters and helped Americans rebuild. We have prevented the disruption of U.S. elections and guarded against foreign interference in our democracy. We have replaced complacency with consequences in cyberspace we are holding digital intruders accountable and we are stepping up our protection of American networks. We have thwarted terrorist plotting against our homeland and launched new efforts to block terrorists and criminals from reaching our shores.

After 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male Voters | RealClearPoliticAfter 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male VoterAfter 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male VoterAfter 2016 Loss Democrats Know They Need White Male VoterVideo: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Article: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Entry: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...UPPER ST. CLAIR TOWNSHIP Pa. (AP) ÛÓ When he moved to Pennsylvania about five years ago it was a coin toss which party Brian Heitman would register with.Since Donald TrumpÛªs election in 2016 Heitman who is 42 and white has become a reliable Democrat. Last week he voted for the Democratic candidate in a special state Senate election in PittsburghÛªs affluent southern suburbs.ÛÏA decade ago I probably wouldnÛªt have even noticed this election was happeningÛ Heitman said ÛÏbut IÛªm making a point in voting in every one I can nowadays.ÛThe DemocratsÛª 2020 presidential primary may feature a historically diverse field of women and minorities but in some ways it is testing how the party appeals to white men such as Heitman. Many Democratic politicians went into the last presidential campaign cycle taking little account of those voters and banked on a coalition of women and minorities to carry them to victory. TrumpÛªs victory proved that thinking wrong. Many in the party are determined now not to make the mistake again.ThatÛªs left Democrats wondering whether the nominee should be someone who can cut deep into TrumpÛªs base picking off large numbers of working-class whites whether itÛªs enough to win over affluent college-educated suburban men and whether party is moving to far left to win them both.ÛÏThe white male vote is indispensable itÛªs a part of any winning coalitionÛ said Democratic pollster Ronald Lester who worked for Hillary ClintonÛªs campaign in 2016. He noted that successful national Democrats perform well with white men and that includes Barack Obama whose strength among white men in the Rust Belt helped fuel his White House victories in 2008 and 2012.Several candidates have jumped in with their own suggestions of how to do that.Former Vice President Joe Biden who hasnÛªt said whether he is running spoke to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in an appearance Friday that seemed designed to show how he could win back white working-class voters. Biden said some of his ÛÏsophisticated friendsÛ donÛªt understand the need to treat laborers with respect.ÛÏHow the hell do we get to the place where a lot of you think the rest of the country doesnÛªt see you or know you?Û Biden asked the mostly male crowd.When Rep. Tim Ryan D-Ohio announced his campaign earlier in the week he said his more centrist approach could appeal to working-class voters like those in his district which embodies the Rust Belt terrain that Trump won.Sen. Amy Klobuchar D-Minn. said her no-frills style has delivered white Midwestern voters before. Former Rep. Beto OÛªRourke D-Texas uses his star appeal that helped him in TexasÛª well-educated suburbs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has said his economic populism will bring rural white voters back to the Democratic fold.Polling makes clear why Democratic are searching for the right messenger.White men make up typically make up about one-third of the electorate. In 2018 41 percent of them voted for Democrats according to AP VoteCast a survey of the national electorate. While DemocratsÛª strength among women won headlines and was often credited with DemocratsÛª strong showing white men also moved to the Democrats column. VoteCast showed Democrats won the votes of 46% of white male college graduates a figure that has given some in the party hope.ÛÏThe revolt in these suburban districts wasnÛªt just about white women it was also about white menÛ said Anna Greenberg a Democratic pollster advising the campaign of former Gov. John Hickenlooper D-Colo. ÛÏJust as thereÛªs been a movement of white college-educated women thereÛªs been a movement of white college-educated men.ÛThat shift is part of a long-term trend.According to the American National Election Survey white men without college degrees have consistently supported the GOP over the past two decades while those with degrees ÛÓ roughly one-fifth of the 2018 electorate ÛÓ have increasingly moved toward Democrats. In 1996 when President Bill Clinton overwhelmingly won re-election he only received 36% of the votes of white male college graduates according to ANES. Hillary Clinton lost her race in 2016 but won 43% of them.Strategists generally find that college-educated white men are more moved by social issues and TrumpÛªs violations of political norms while those without degrees are more concerned about economic issues and like candidates who may shake up the establishment. In Pennsylvania Democrats have gained ground among both groups since TrumpÛªs election but some see the college-educated cohort as the most promising.Democrats picked up three U.S. House seats in Pennsylvania in November flipping suburban districts while also easily defending a U.S. Senate seat and the governorÛªs mansion.ÛÏThe current coalition ÛÓ urban suburban women and these college-educated males ÛÓ will likely put Pennsylvania back in the Democratic columnÛ said Mike Mikus a veteran Democratic strategist who lives in the affluent suburbs of the 37th state Senate district.Trump won the traditionally Republican district by 6 percentage points in 2016. But after its Republican state senator was elected to Congress in November Democrats targeted the seat. They counted on flipping its educated populace of lawyers consultants and doctors who fill its colonial-style houses and shopping centers that spill over the ridgelines outside Pittsburgh.ÛÏThere are college-educated men who have at least temporarily put their Republican Party membership card in their pocket for a whileÛ Mikus said of his neighbors. But he warned these new Democratic voters may only be willing to tolerate so much in a party swinging to the left. ÛÏThey are somewhat conservative. They donÛªt like paying a lot of taxes.ÛAlfred Schnabel is one of them. The 42-year-old business analyst has kept his GOP registration but feels unwanted in either party. He is turned off by Trump and wary of Democratic presidential hopefuls such as Sanders.ÛÏThere seems to be a push to go super-progressiveÛ he said of Democrats.Still Schnabel volunteered for a local Democratic legislative candidate last year because he was infuriated at his state representativeÛªs criticism of gay people and his frustration at the GOP outweighs his concerns about Democrats. He chalks up his ability to evolve politically to his education.ÛÏGoing to college I met people who were gay people from other culturesÛ Schnabel said. ÛÏThat stayed with me.ÛMike Wessell is still a registered Republican but he was comfortable at the victory party last Tuesday night for the Democrat Pam Iovino who won the state Senate race comfortably.ÛÏIÛªm not happy with the way President Trump has been running the country or his ideologyÛ said Wessell a corporate lawyer. He cited TrumpÛªs immigration stance and denial of climate science.Wessell worked on the campaign of Conor Lamb the Democrat whose special election victory last year in a congressional district that overlaps with the 37th presaged DemocratsÛª new strength in the state. He even appeared in an ad for Democratic Sen. Bob CaseyÛªs re-election campaign later that year with his wife who is an active Democrat.Wessell is also wary of Sanders but he knows he wonÛªt be voting Trump in 2020. HeÛªs still hanging onto his Republican registration though.ÛÏI havenÛªt given up on my partyÛ Wessell said as a roomful of Democrats cheered their latest win.Log In with your RCMG Accoun,0

She was ousted from her post two days later. (Jacquelyn Martin / Associated Press)Shortly before ousting Homeland Security Secretarysaid heÛªll take an even ÛÏtougherÛ tack on border policies that for more than two years by his own measure have failed to deter immigration.Some fear that may include a return of the reviled family separations that Trump was forced to back away from last year as well as more firings.But experts cautioned that replacing high-level personnel may not be enough to salvage an immigration policy that isnÛªt working and has been reined in by the courts andIn the latest example of the administration's string of losses in court late Monday a federal judge in San Franciscoblocking the Trump administration policy forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico.A U.S. judge on Monday blocked thepolicy of returning asylum seekers to Mexicas they wait for an immigration court to hear their cases but the order won't immediately go into effect.Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco granted a request by civil liberties groups to...Roughly 1000 asylum seekers have been forced to remain in Mexico since the administration announced that policy early this year. The judge gave the administration until April 12 to seek a stay from the court of appeals.takes a more prominent role in implementing an immigration policy he has largely orchestrated behind the scenes since Trump took office.In addition to urging the president to push out Nielsen Miller a long-time immigration hardliner is thought to have other administration officials in his sights.On Monday Trump made the surprise announcement thatDirector Randolph ÛÏTexÛ Alles would be replaced. Both Nielsen and Alles were closely associated with former White House Chief of Staff who resigned last year after falling out of favor with Trump.On Thursday night Trump blindsided many administration officials by abruptly withdrawing the nomination of a career official Ronald D. Vitiello to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement.ÛÏMillerÛªs going to clean houseÛ said a former White House official calling Alles ÛÏKellyÛªs best friend.Û The former official who did not want to be identified speaking about his one-time colleagues predicted more departures. ÛÏHeÛªs firing all of KellyÛªs people.ÛRELATED: 5 misconceptions about the U.S.-Mexico border åÈNielsen TrumpÛªs second Homeland Security secretary was pushed out largely due to frustration over a recent spike in asylum-seeking Central American families and TrumpÛªs growing annoyance that she wouldnÛªt take more aggressive steps.shortly after announcing her imminent departure. ÛÏÛ_ Will Close Southern Border If necessary...ÛFor Trump and his closest aides ÛÓ particularly Miller ÛÓ the tough rhetoric is a red-meat handout to a base they see as critical to winning the White House again in 2020.At the same time the moves may be intended to mask the fact that their strategy to ramp-up immigration enforcement has failed to reduce near-record numbers of asylum seekers and families. Hemmed in by U.S. immigration law a Democratic-led House and the realities of the border critics and supporters alike wonder where the president can actually go from here.ÛÏStephen Miller and the administration ran out of options and resorted to eating their ownÛ said Blain Rethmeier who worked in President George W. BushÛªs White House with Nielsen. ÛÏLiterally absent Congress and the courts every option has been exhausted.ÛMiller is consolidating his already considerable power over White House immigration and border security policy and proving he still very much has the presidentÛªs ear.Much of MillerÛªs clout comes from TrumpÛªs familiarity with him said Corey Lewandowski a former campaign manager for Trump who still spends time with the president.ÛÏHeÛªs been there obviously since January Ûª16 so heÛªs a known commodityÛ Lewandowski said.Tim Naftali a presidential historian at NYU raised concerns about the direction of the administration's latest moves which he argues are about more than immigration policy.ÛÏThis is about how we as Americans define ourselves"" Naftali said. ""He is looking for people who will implement the harshest meanest approach to immigration since the 1920s. And he'll keep cycling through people until he finds an implementer of his cruel vision.""RELATED: How border patrol chases have spun out of control with deadly consequences åÈMark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies which supports less immigration to the United States agreed thereÛªs not much more a Homeland Security secretary can do unless the White House demands more dramatic action such as setting up tent cities along the border.ÛÏIÛªm just not sure that itÛªs something a different DHS secretary can do rather than the White House making the decisionÛ he said.Krikorian does not believe shutting down the border will be back on the agenda any time soon given that Trump ÛÏmade the blusterÛ and then retreated.Resuming family separations may also be tricky since Trump signed an executive order to stop the practice and spoke out publicly against separations ÛÓ and a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction to block the practice ordering the government to reunite families.For her part Nielsen made clear Monday that she wonÛªt be abandoning her consistent support of the presidentÛªs policies and wonÛªt be trying to undermine him after her departure later this week.ÛÏI share the presidentÛªs goal of securing the border"" Nielsen said outside her townhouse in Alexandria Va. ""I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border.ÛNielsen had been among thmost controversial of TrumpÛªs Cabinet secretariesgiven TrumpÛªs mandate to push boundaries on immigration an issue that he considers central to his political standing. But her vocal defense was not enough to save her job.With Trump naming Kevin McAleenan the Customs and Border Protection commissioner as acting head of DHS the administration will soon have no CBP chief. There are also legal questions about why Trump did not follow the mandated line of succession by elevating the deputy Homeland Security secretary who is also in an acting role.In an administration already rife with record turnover the rapid personnel changes could exacerbate internal conflict at the Homeland Security department the third-largest in the federal government even as it grapples with what Nielsen and others have termed a ÛÏsystem-wide meltdownÛ in handling border security and immigration.Krikorian described a turf war between ICE and Border Patrol and questioned whether McAleenan will be nominated to permanently lead the department.ÛÏIs McAleenan just a placeholder?Û said Krikorian. ÛÏI just donÛªt get the sense that heÛªs going to bring about any kind of systemic change Û_ [DHS] Headquarters is full of people who just arenÛªt really super enthusiastic about the presidentÛªs broad agenda on immigration.ÛMark Morgan a former FBI official who served as chief of Border Patrol under President Obama said White House officials ÛÏneed to stop expecting that Congress is going to do their jobÛ and reform immigration laws.ÛÏDHS is going to have to address this issue all aloneÛ he said. He said the administration should keep up the pressure on Mexico to do more to stop migrants from transiting the country to the U.S. border  increase the number of immigration judges to more quickly adjudicate cases.Morgan said he doesnÛªt believe the White House will resume family separations but added that immediate action must be taken ÛÓ even if it risks legal action.ÛÏWe have to do somethingÛ he said. ÛÏEven if we lose in the courts we still gotta do something to stop the incentive [to migrate].ÛNo sÌ_lo delincuentes: ICE tambiÌ©n arresta a residentes permanentes legaleHallazgos de molÌ©culas orgÌÁnicas en Marte ofrecen pistas alentadoras en la bÌ¼squeda de vida en ese planetåÀEstarÌÁ esta chica angelina a la altura?
